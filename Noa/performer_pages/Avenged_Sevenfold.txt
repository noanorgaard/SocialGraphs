<p><b>Avenged Sevenfold</b> (abbreviated as <b>A7X</b>) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, bassist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.
</p><p>Avenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut album <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i>; they largely continued this sound through their second album <i>Waking the Fallen</i>. The band's style had evolved by their third album and first major label release, <i>City of Evil</i>, into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their founding drummer, Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of Dream Theater member Mike Portnoy, and released and toured in support of their fifth album <i>Nightmare</i> in 2010, which debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200, their first number one debut.
</p><p>In 2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album <i>Hail to the King</i>, which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style, with it being written as a tribute to their influences. <i>Hail to the King</i> charted as number 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album <i>The Stage</i> in October 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart in the US. <i>The Stage</i> is their first conceptual album and marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal sound. The band released their eighth studio album, <i>Life Is But a Dream...</i>, a highly experimental record, in June 2023.
</p><p>To date, Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide, and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution (RIAA). They have also created four original songs for the <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP <i>Black Reign</i>. The band were ranked No. 47 on <i>Loudwire's</i> list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time. Christina Fuoco of <i>AllMusic</i> called Avenged Sevenfold "one of the more successful and accessible metalcore outfits of the early 21st century."

<p>Avenged Sevenfold was formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California by Matt Sanders, James Sullivan, Zachary Baker and Matt Wendt. Although they are not a religious band, Sanders came up with the name as a reference to the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible, which can be found in Genesis 4:24. All four members already had experience performing in bands, with Sanders being the vocalist and Wendt the bassist for the punk band Successful Failure, Baker playing guitar in the punk bands Society Down and MPA (short for Mad Porn Action/Addiction), and Sullivan being the drummer for the ska band Suburban Legends (formerly known as Bomb Squad).
</p><p>Avenged Sevenfold's first creative output was a three-song-demo recorded in October 1999 at the A-Room Studios in Orange County, California. The band played their first show at the Walnut, California City Hall on February 11, 2000. Around this time, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute to two compilations, so the band recorded two new songs and released them along with the previously recorded songs on a second demo. They sent this demo to the Belgian label Good Life Recordings and were subsequently signed. Afterwards, the band participated in another two compilation albums, their label's <i>GoodLife 4</i> and Novocaine Records' <i>Scrape III</i> compilations. Around this time, Matt Wendt left for college and Justin Meacham, the previous bassist of Suburban Legends, joined Avenged Sevenfold. In late 2000, the foursome took on their initial stage names – M. Shadows, Zacky Vengeance, Justin Sane and The Rev – and recorded their debut album, <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i>. In early 2001, lead guitarist and old friend Synyster Gates joined the band and they re-recorded the introductory track "To End the Rapture" for the album's lead-single/EP, <i>Warmness on the Soul</i>, released in April 2001. Although their debut album's release was initially planned for the same month, it was pushed back multiple times and eventually released on July 24, 2001, on Good Life Recordings.
</p><p>Around August 2001, Meacham attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. This event was the reason for Avenged Sevenfold to join the Take Action Tour in 2003. During Meacham's hospitalization, he remained in poor condition and had to leave the band. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's going on all around you, and it makes you want to do something to prevent it from happening to other people." His replacement was Frank Melcom, stage name Dameon Ash, who performed with the band for the following months, but does not appear on any releases.
</p><p>On January 18, 2002, Avenged Sevenfold left Good Life Recordings and signed with Hopeless Records. They re-released their debut album on March 19 and also appeared on the <i>Hopelessly Devoted To You Vol. 4</i> sampler in April. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall. They spent the year touring in support of their debut album and participated in the Vans Warped Tour. In September, Dameon Ash left Avenged Sevenfold and their current bassist Johnny Christ joined them, completing their best known line-up.

<p>Having found a new bassist, the group released their second studio album titled <i>Waking the Fallen</i> on Hopeless Records in August 2003. The album featured a more refined and mature sound production in comparison to their previous album. The band received profiles in <i>Billboard</i> and <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and again played on the Vans Warped and Take Action tours. Baker recalled: "We didn’t care if [the bands we were playing with] were heavy-metal bands; we didn’t care if they were fucking pop-punk bands; we didn’t care, we were opening for everyone. And people started taking notice. You know if your band is going crazy and breaking your instruments and playing the fastest, craziest music at a pop-punk show, people take notice, whether it’s good or it’s bad." Shortly after the release of <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, Avenged Sevenfold left Hopeless Records and were officially signed to Warner Bros. Records on November 1, 2003. The band then toured Europe for the first time in its career. M. Shadows recalled, "It was everything you would imagine it to be: pure debauchery." Synyster Gates remarked: "It’s unbelievable that we survived that [tour]. Really, any night could just escalate – not just because of us, but because of being in a foreign place, being out too late. There were people around you that just wouldn’t stop buying you shots. One time I had 10 shots of Aftershock in my hand, and next to me was my Snakebite and black. I should’ve died of alcohol poisoning! By the end of that first UK tour, we were 10 pounds heavier and pretty fucked.” In 2004, Avenged Sevenfold toured again on the Vans Warped Tour and recorded a video for their song "Unholy Confessions" which went into rotation on MTV2's <i>Headbangers Ball</i>.
</p><p><i>City of Evil</i>, the band's third album and major label debut, was released on June 6, 2005, and debuted at No. 30 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, selling over 30,000 copies in its first week of release. It utilized a more classic metal sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous albums, which had been grouped into the metalcore genre. The album is also notable for the absence of screamed and growled vocals; M. Shadows worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson—whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell—for months before the album's release to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone". The album received positive reviews from several magazines and websites and is credited for propelling the band into international popularity.

<p>After playing Ozzfest in 2006, Avenged Sevenfold memorably beat out R&amp;B singers Rihanna and Chris Brown, Panic! at the Disco, Angels &amp; Airwaves and James Blunt for the title of Best New Artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, thanks in part to their <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>-inspired song "Bat Country." They returned to the Vans Warped Tour, this time headlining and then continued on their own "Cities of Evil Tour." In addition, their lead single "Bat Country" reached No. 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Rock Charts, No.6 on the <i>Billboard</i> Modern Rock Charts and the accompanying video made it to No. 1 on MTV's Total Request Live. Propelled by this success, the album sold well and became Avenged Sevenfold's first Gold record. It was later certified platinum in August 2009.
Avenged Sevenfold was invited to join Ozzfest tour on the main stage, alongside other well known rock/heavy metal acts such as DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Disturbed and System of a Down for the first time in 2006. That same year they also completed a worldwide tour, including the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. After a sixteen-month promotion of <i>City of Evil</i>, the band announced that they were cancelling their Fall 2006 tour to record new music. In the interim, the band released their first DVD titled <i>All Excess</i> on July 17, 2007. <i>All Excess</i>, which debuted as the No. 1 DVD in the US, included live performances and backstage footage that spanned the band's eight-year career. Two tribute albums, <i>Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: Bat Wings and Broken Strings</i> and <i>Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold: The String Tribute</i> were also released in October 2007.
</p><p>On October 30, 2007, Avenged Sevenfold released their self-titled album, the band's fourth studio album. It debuted at No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, "Critical Acclaim" and "Almost Easy" were released prior to the album's debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for "A Little Piece of Heaven". Due to the song's controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, "Afterlife" and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, "Dear God", was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded "Album of the Year" at the Kerrang! Awards.
</p><p>Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. Footage from their last show in Long Beach was used for the band's next release, <i>Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough</i>, released on September 16, 2008. Its content includes live DVD from their performance at Long Beach, and a CD containing B-sides from <i>Avenged Sevenfold</i>, and other rarities, such as covers from Pantera's "Walk" and Iron Maiden's "Flash of the Blade".

<p>In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also played at Rock on the Range, from May 16–17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N' Roses' "It's So Easy" onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. On December 28, 2009, the band's drummer James "The Rev" Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. The band announced his death with a statement saying: "It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we tell you of the passing today of Jimmy ‘The Rev’ Sullivan. Jimmy was not only one of the world’s best drummers, but more importantly he was our best friend and brother. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jimmy’s family and we hope that you will respect their privacy during this difficult time." Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an "acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the death of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support.
</p><p>The band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point in time, however, on February 17, 2010, they stated that they had entered the studio, along with Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the album, in place of The Rev.
</p>

<p>The single "Nightmare" was digitally released on May 18, 2010. The song was leaked on May 6, 2010, on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and <i>Nightmare</i> was finally released on July 27, 2010, in the United States.

</p><p>In July 2015, the band announced on their website that they would part ways with drummer Arin Ilejay, due to "creative differences". Ilejay has stated that he was not expecting his firing. He recalled: "I was totally shocked and scared out of my mind when Synyster Gates called to let me go. I was like, ‘Oh my God – my wife is about to have a baby. How am I going to support my family now?" M. Shadows recounted the band's side of the situation to <i>Ultimate Guitar</i>, saying: "Arin got more and more distanced as time went on. It's kind of like everyone goes through their honeymoon period and it's all great, but then you start realizing that we're four guys that have a way we do things and then there's someone else that just doesn't really fit into that at all. And as nice of a guy as he is, there were just a bunch of things that didn't represent us at all, and you can't have that, especially when we've worked for so long and so hard at what we do. And the last thing we care about is our public perception of what we should do with our lives."
</p><p>Although Ilejay was fired in July 2015, his dismissal and replacement had reportedly been planned as early as mid-2014. In October 2015, the band announced on their website that they had been working with a new drummer for over a year, making sure that it was a good fit before making sudden changes.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h3>
<p>Avenged Sevenfold's musical style has consistently evolved throughout the duration of the band's career. As a result, the band has been categorized under several genres of heavy and extreme music, primarily heavy metal, alternative metal, hard rock, and progressive metal (most notably in their album <i>The Stage</i>). Members of the band cite In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slayer, Mr. Bungle, Elton John, Leonard Cohen, At the Gates, Helloween, Dream Theater, Pennywise, NOFX, Pantera, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, the Beatles, Anthrax, Testament, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and the Rolling Stones as influences.
</p><p>The band's initial style in their first two albums was primarily categorized as metalcore, which according to Johnny Loftus of <i>AllMusic</i>, also "freely incorporated emo, screamo and post-hardcore elements." The band's debut album <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i>, while consisting largely of a hardcore or metalcore sound, has several deviations from this genre, most notably in "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, the band continued the metalcore style, but incorporated more clean singing, and leaning more towards heavy metal than hardcore punk. According to M. Shadows, "We had two intentions. We wanted to be the heaviest and most melodic band at that time.” In the band's DVD <i>All Excess</i>, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: "When I met the band after <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i> had come out before they had recorded <i>Waking the Fallen</i>, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'." Zacky Vengeance recalled the transition: "<i>Waking</i> was the first time we pushed [Shadows] to sing more. I remember at the beginning of [the album cycle], he was all screaming, and one time he was, like, kind of dicking around, singing the melody instead of screaming, and we were like, ‘Dude, you have to sing that!’ And so he did, and it was incredible, you know, and then we were like, ‘OK, all right, we’re allowed to fucking sing. If you have a good voice, you don’t have to scream just to scream.'"
</p><p>On Avenged Sevenfold's third album <i>City of Evil</i>, the band chose to outright abandon the metalcore genre, creating a "sleazy" sound consistent with hard rock, heavy metal, and progressive metal. Sanders drew influence from European power metal for his vocals during this time. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album experiments with an even wider array of musical genres than that from <i>City of Evil</i>, most notably in "Dear God", which shows a country style and "A Little Piece of Heaven", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. <i>Nightmare</i> contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called "Fiction", progressive metal-oriented track "Save Me" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on "God Hates Us". The band's sixth studio album <i>Hail to the King</i> shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their seventh album <i>The Stage</i>, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. Their eighth album, <i>Life Is But a Dream...</i> shows the band taking on more of an avant-garde metal sound.

<p>The band's lyrics occasionally incorporate Biblical imagery. When asked if Avenged Sevenfold is a Christian band, M. Shadows replied: "Absolutely not. I don’t believe in those things. I try not to get into that because a lot of our fans are Christians and a lot aren’t." The band's lyrics have also incorporated political themes, such as in "Critical Acclaim". In 2006, Shadows said: "Most people know we're kind of one of the only bands around right now that will admit that we're Republican. When we went on the Warped Tour last year — all of those bands, they're not only anti-war, they're anti-everything our country stands for. We were like, 'fuck this.' We're going to wear our America shirts." Shadows stated the band had shifted stances slightly in 2020, saying in an open letter: "I am aware that in the past Avenged has antagonized with some of our lyrics and imagery. We have also used confederate flags in our artwork while paying tribute to artists we grew up listening to or simply trying to start controversy. I'm sure we will be called out, and rightfully so, by people reading this. No excuses. But everyone grows up at some point, and I feel grateful that we have an audience that has allowed us to evolve with them."

<p>Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the new wave of American heavy metal.  Despite being classified as such by most publications, some have suggested that Avenged Sevenfold is not "metal enough". Vocalist M. Shadows said: "we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?" Similarly, he opined: "If someone calls us a hardcore band we’re just like, ‘Oh... whatever. Are you gonna listen to Hatebreed or are you gonna listen to us?’ Most fucking hardcore bands want to be metal bands anyway but they just can’t play well enough." Eli Enis of <i>Revolver</i> assessed: "sure, if you take Cannibal Corpse with your afternoon tea then maybe the O.C. band don't cut it."
</p><p>Speaking of the band's mainstream exposure through <i>MTV</i> programs such as <i>Total Request Live</i>, Zachy Vengeance said, "you have a five-and-a-half-minute song on the radio, and you have a video with a band, fucking tattoos from head to toe, No. 1 on <i>TRL</i> and with guitar solos and shit. [...] And we're just kind of like, the joke's on mainstream music at that point. Here we are, fucking metal, punks, fucking who knows what kind of band, getting attention." M. Shadows recalled, "We found out that 80 percent of the kids that bought [City of Evil] were Avenged fans, and about 20 percent of them were <i>TRL</i> fans, like, 'I like 'Bat Country.' But I think that it got the attention of a lot of people, active-rock listeners or, you know, like, older metal people that are watching." Zacky Vengeance recalled the band's transition from underground to mainstream success: "[<i>Ozzfest</i>] people <i>don't want</i> the band that's on fucking MTV, a bunch of fucking 23-year-old assholes. They love people that they respect, and we're like, Wow, MTV and all that shit, it doesn't fucking make you a giant band, it doesn't give you longevity, and it doesn't win these fucking people over."
