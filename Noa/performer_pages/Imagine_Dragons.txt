<p><b>Imagine Dragons</b> are an American pop rock band formed in 2008, based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The band currently consists of lead singer Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, and bassist Ben McKee. They first gained exposure with the release of their single "It's Time", followed by their debut album <i>Night Visions</i> (2012), which resulted in the chart-topping singles "Radioactive" and "Demons". <i>Rolling Stone</i> named "Radioactive", which held the record for most weeks charted on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, the "biggest rock hit of the year". MTV called them "the year's biggest breakout band", and <i>Billboard</i> named them their "Breakthrough Band of 2013" and "Biggest Band of 2017", and placed them at the top of their "Year in Rock" rankings for 2013, 2017, and 2018. Imagine Dragons topped the <i>Billboard</i> Year-End "Top Artists – Duo/Group" category in 2018.
</p><p>The band's second studio album <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada, and the UK. This was followed by their third studio album <i>Evolve</i> (2017), which resulted in three chart-topping singles, "Believer", "Thunder", and "Whatever It Takes", also making them the artist with the most weeks at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Rock Songs chart. The album reached the top five in many countries. The band's fourth studio album <i>Origins</i> (2018) featured the single "Natural", which became their fifth song to top the Hot Rock Songs chart. The band has since released <i>Mercury – Acts 1 &amp; 2</i> (2022), a double album featuring the US top 5 hit "Enemy", and <i>Loom</i> (2024), their first album without longtime drummer Daniel Platzman. Despite their popularity and commercial success, the band's music has been consistently met with mixed critical reception.
</p><p>Imagine Dragons won three American Music Awards, nine <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, one Grammy Award, one MTV Video Music Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for 14 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres.

They were the most streamed group of 2018 on Spotify, the first rock act to have four songs, "Radioactive", "Demons", "Believer", and "Thunder", to surpass one billion streams each, and the only group in RIAA history to have four songs certified higher than Diamond.

<p>In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students. Reynolds and Tolman recruited Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano, respectively, for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, which Reynolds stated each member approved of. The five-piece recorded demos that they uploaded to MySpace that year, but Beck and Florence left the band later that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited long-time high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music, to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing back-up and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band shortly thereafter, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the line-up. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.
</p><p>The band released a self-titled EP <i>Imagine Dragons</i> on September 1, 2009, and <i>Hell and Silence</i> on March 10, 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. Six months after releasing their third EP, <i>It's Time</i>, on March 12, 2011, they signed a record deal with Interscope Records on November 18, 2011.
</p><p>They got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including "Best CD of 2011" (<i>Vegas SEVEN</i>), "Best Local Indie Band 2010" (<i>Las Vegas Weekly</i>), "Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act" (<i>Las Vegas CityLife</i>), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011, they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy Award-winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually, the Tolmans left the group. Drummer Daniel Platzman and keyboardist Theresa Flaminio were recruited by McKee in August 2011, prior to the band's label deal in November 2011. Flaminio departed from the group around the time of the band's deal with Interscope, leaving the band a four-piece.

<p>The idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their "New Year's resolution", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from.
</p><p>Prior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction</i>, called "Battle Cry" in June, 2014 and the song "Warriors" for the 2014 <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship in September, 2014.

</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Public_image">Public image</h2>
<p>Despite their popularity and large social media followings, reception towards Imagine Dragons from other musicians and music critics has been mixed since their breakthrough to the mainstream. Review aggregator Metacritic reports that the band's first four studio albums—<i>Night Visions</i>, <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i>, <i>Evolve</i>, and <i>Origins</i>—have scores of 53, 60, 47, and 59, respectively, out of 100, indicating generally mixed reviews. The band's music has been criticized for its repetitive lyrics, "overblown" arena rock production, overemphasis on reverberation effects, sticking to formulas, and genre-hopping. Following the band's halftime show performance at the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship, American music publication <i>Spin</i> ran an article titled 'Is Imagine Dragons The Worst Band Ever?', which described the band's songs as having lyrics that are "a composite of motivational platitudes and pseudo-dramatic yelps" which "barely merit repeating, if only because Reynolds seems so willing to do that himself" and featuring a "punishing, squelching rhythmic force". The band has frequently been compared to Canadian rock band Nickelback by critics, referring to Nickelback's own negative public perception.
</p><p>Despite this criticism, the band has described themselves as "genre-less". In an interview with <i>Billboard</i> at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Reynolds stated, "We've always kind of prided ourselves on being kind of a genre-less band. [...] I have no idea how I'd categorize us. Sometimes it's definitely pop; sometimes the songs are all guitar-driven. It depends on the song." The band has been praised by some for their genre-bending style, and for keeping arena rock popular during the 2010s, a decade which saw guitars and bands dwindling in mainstream music.
</p><p>The band has also been the subject of ridicule by several musicians. In a 2019 interview, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor echoed the Nickelback comparisons, claiming that Nickelback were "passing the baton of being rock and roll's scapegoat" to Imagine Dragons. Matty Healy of the 1975 described "Radioactive" as 'nothingness', stating, "It might as well be called 'Pikachu Banana'." In a 2018 interview, Mark Foster joked that his band Foster the People give their rejected material to Imagine Dragons. In response, Reynolds took to Twitter, denouncing what he described as "click-bait horse shit filled with vile and hate meant to feed humanity's need to laugh at each other's imperfections and fails." Foster issued an apology to Reynolds on Twitter, expressing regret over the joke and praising him for his humanitarian efforts. Taylor, on the other hand, criticized Reynolds and claimed that his words were taken out of context, tweeting, "As long as people are stupid, letting salacious headlines do their thinking for them, there will always be controversy. Do some research and find the truth...". Healy responded in a radio interview, stating, "You're a millionaire in a huge band. You don't say, 'Oh, I'm gonna do this, and also can I be void of criticism?' It's like … no."
</p><p>The band has ignored calls from pro-Palestinian activists to boycott Israel, performing in Tel Aviv, Israel on August 30, 2023. In a similar case, the band performed in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was criticized by System of a Down singer and activist Serj Tankian, as it could be seen as "an endorsement of Azerbaijan's authoritarian president, Ilham Aliyev". Reynolds defended the performances in a 2024 interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i>, stating, "I don't believe in depriving our fans who want to see us play because of the acts of their leaders and their governments. I think that's a really slippery slope. I think the second you start to do that, there's corrupt leaders and warmongers all over the world, and where do you draw the line?" In May 2025, the band garnered attention when Reynolds displayed the Palestinian flag at the end of the band's performance in Milan, Italy.

These funds were used to purchase 92 vehicles that are already helping Ukrainian medics in the field.
</p><p>On May 10, 2023, the band released a music video for the song "Crushed". Directed by Ty Arnold, the video tells the true story of a 14-year-old boy named Sasha. Russian troops occupied his village for five months until Ukrainian forces finally liberated it. Despite this, the conflict left his home, school and neighborhood in ruins. He survived the shelling only by hiding in an underground shelter. The visualization details his story of perseverance as he walks through the rubble.
