<p>When they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire. After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, a deliberate misspelling of a small East Riding of Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university.

<p>Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and without any direction after the release of an album (<i>22</i>) and three singles ("Heavy", "Good Bad Right Wrong" and "Hessles").
</p><p>According to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, "No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them." The band decided that they would aim for a longer-term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe.
</p><p>Manager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams, who persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: "I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles." Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.

<p>In July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow. headlined by UK band Goldblade. One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year.

It reached number two on the UK albums chart, and was certified five times platinum. In 2005, <i>Employment</i> was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons. In 2006, <i>Employment</i> won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album'
</p><p>The first single released from the album was "Oh My God" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album <i>Version</i>. "I Predict a Riot" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the <i>NME</i> "Greatest Indie Anthems Ever" countdown.

<p><i>Stay Together</i>, the band's sixth studio album, was released on 7 October 2016. It was co-written and produced by Brian Higgins, whose production company Xenomania has worked with the likes of Girls Aloud and Pet Shop Boys. The album's name is a reference to the song "We Stay Together". The first single from the album, "Parachute", was released on 14 June 2016. The second single, "Hole In My Soul" was released 18 August 2016 and the third and final single, "We Stay Together" was released on 9 December 2016.
</p><p>This welcome return to the limelight saw ‘Stay Together’ push new boundaries to "take this nondescript sound and stuff it impressively full of sing-a-long hooks, covering topics including monogamy (We Stay Together) and shagging (Good Clean Fun)" as it marked an entirely new direction for the band, who went for a more dance-oriented sound. While <i>Education, Education, Education and War</i> was more focused on politics and the perils of war, the Kaiser Chiefs made the album with a focus on love and relationships. Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': "The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there's a lot more blurred line. There's no right or wrong."
</p><p>The band performed a string of best of forest shows in the summer of 2016 as part the <i>Forestry Commission'</i>s <i>Forest Live</i> series. Stay Together was toured across Europe in early 2017.
