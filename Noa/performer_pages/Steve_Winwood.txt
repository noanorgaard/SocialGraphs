<p><b>Stephen Lawrence Winwood</b> (born 12 May 1948) is an English musician and songwriter whose genres include blue-eyed soul, rhythm and blues, blues rock, and pop rock. Though primarily a guitarist, keyboard player, and vocalist prominent for his distinctive soulful high tenor voice, Winwood also plays instruments including mandolin, bass, drums and percussion.
</p><p>Winwood achieved fame during the 1960s and 1970s as an integral member of three successful bands: the Spencer Davis Group (1964–1967), Traffic (1967–1969 and 1970–1974), and Blind Faith (1969). During the 1980s, his solo career flourished and he had a number of hit singles, including "While You See a Chance" (1980) from the album <i>Arc of a Diver</i> and "Valerie" (1982) from <i>Talking Back to the Night</i> ("Valerie" became a hit when it was re-released with a remix from Winwood's 1987 compilation album <i>Chronicles</i>).
</p><p>Winwood's 1986 album <i>Back in the High Life</i> marked his career zenith, with hit singles including "Back in the High Life Again", "The Finer Things", and the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one hit "Higher Love". He reached number one on the Hot 100 again with "Roll with It" (1988) from the album <i>Roll with It</i>, with "Don't You Know What the Night Can Do?" and "Holding On" also charting highly the same year. Although his hit singles ceased after the 1980s, he continued to release new albums. His most recent album, <i>Nine Lives</i>, was released in 2008. The 2004 song "Call on Me", built on a sample of "Valerie", spent five weeks at No. 1 on the UK singles chart.
</p><p>In 2004, Winwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Traffic. He has won two Grammy Awards and an Ivor Novello Award, and has been honored as a BMI Icon. In 2008, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Winwood the 33rd-greatest singer. In 2025, Winwood was appointed a Member of the British Empire (MBE) in the King's Birthday Honours.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Early_life">Early life</h2>
<p>Winwood was born on 12 May 1948 in Handsworth, Birmingham. His father Lawrence, a foundryman by trade, was a semi-professional musician, playing mainly the saxophone and clarinet. Steve Winwood began playing piano at the age of four while interested in swing and Dixieland jazz, and soon started playing drums and guitar. He was also a choirboy at St John the Evangelist's Church, Perry Barr. The family moved from Handsworth to Atlantic Road, Kingstanding, Birmingham, and he attended Great Barr School, one of the first comprehensive schools. He also attended classes at the Birmingham and Midland Institute to develop his skills as a pianist, but did not complete his course. During this time, he befriended future Fleetwood Mac member Christine Perfect.
</p><p>At eight years of age, Winwood first performed with his father and elder brother Muff in the Ron Atkinson band. Muff Winwood later recalled that when Steve began playing regularly with him and his father in licensed pubs and clubs, the piano had to be turned with its back to the audience to try to hide him because he was so obviously underage.

<p>While still a pupil at Great Barr School, Winwood was a part of the Birmingham blues rock scene, playing the Hammond C-3 organ and guitar, backing blues and rock legends such as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley on their United Kingdom tours, the custom at that time being for US singers to travel solo and be backed by pick-up bands. At this time, Winwood was living on Atlantic Road in Kingstanding, close to the Birmingham music halls where he played. Winwood modelled his singing after Ray Charles.

<p>In 1963, Winwood (then known as "Stevie" Winwood) became singer and keyboardist of the Spencer Davis Group, with his older brother Muff Winwood on bass, Spencer Davis on guitar, and Pete York on drums. Davis had been impressed by the Winwood brothers after he saw them performing as the Muffy Wood Jazz Band at the Golden Eagle in Birmingham. The Spencer Davis Group made their debut at the Eagle and subsequently had a Monday-night residency there. Winwood's distinctive high tenor singing voice and vocal style drew comparisons to Ray Charles.
</p><p>In 1964, the Spencer Davis Group signed their first recording contract with Island Records. Producer and founder Chris Blackwell later said of Winwood, "He was really the cornerstone of Island Records. He's a musical genius and because he was with Island all the other talent really wanted to be with Island." The group's first single "Dimples" was released 10 days after Winwood's 16th birthday. 
</p><p>The group had two UK No. 1 singles in late 1965 and early 1966 with "Keep on Running" and "Somebody Help Me"; the money from this success allowed Winwood to buy his own Hammond organ. Winwood co-wrote the band's breakthrough hits in America, "Gimme Some Lovin'" and "I'm a Man", both of which went Top 10 in the US and UK in late 1966 and early 1967. Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967.

<p>Winwood met drummer Jim Capaldi, guitarist Dave Mason, and multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood when they jammed together at The Elbow Room, a club in Aston, Birmingham. After Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967, the quartet formed Traffic. Soon thereafter, they rented a cottage near the rural village of Aston Tirrold, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), to write and rehearse new music. This allowed them to escape the city and develop their music.
</p><p>Early in Traffic's formation, Winwood and Capaldi formed a songwriting partnership, with Winwood writing music to match Capaldi's lyrics. This partnership was the source of most of Traffic's material, including popular songs such as "Paper Sun", "No Face, No Name, No Number", "Dear Mr. Fantasy", and "The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys", and outlived the band, producing several songs for Winwood's and Capaldi's solo albums. Over the band's history, Winwood performed the majority of their lead vocals, keyboard instruments, and guitars, guitars more so after Mason's departure in 1968. Traffic disbanded in early 1969 after two albums, <i>Mr. Fantasy</i> (1967) and <i>Traffic</i> (1968), with a third album, <i>Last Exit</i>, being issued later that year.
</p>

<p>Following Traffic's split, Winwood formed the supergroup Blind Faith, along with former Cream members Eric Clapton (guitar) and Ginger Baker (drums), and former Family member Ric Grech (bass). The band produced only one album, which reached No. 1 in both the UK and US, and included "Can't Find My Way Home". The band was short-lived owing to Clapton's greater interest in Blind Faith's opening act on tour, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends; Clapton left the band at the tour's completion, bringing Blind Faith to an end.
</p>

<p>In 1970, Winwood went into the studio to begin work on a solo album, tentatively titled <i>Mad Shadows</i>. Winwood ended up calling in his former Traffic bandmates Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood to help, with the recording resulting in a Traffic reunion album <i>John Barleycorn Must Die</i>. Traffic would continue for another five albums, <i>Welcome to the Canteen</i> (1971), <i>The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys</i> (1971), <i>Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory</i> (1973), <i>On the Road</i> (1973) and <i>When the Eagle Flies</i> (1974). Weariness with the grind of touring and recording prompted Winwood to break up Traffic in 1974 and retire to session work for several years.

<p>In 1966, three years before Blind Faith, Winwood guested with Eric Clapton as part of the temporary group Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. Three tracks were recorded and released on the 1966 various artists compilation album, <i>What's Shakin'</i>. In 1968, Winwood was recruited by Jimi Hendrix to play organ for "Voodoo Chile" on the <i>Electric Ladyland</i> album.
</p><p>Following the end of Blind Faith, Winwood and Ric Grech continued working with Ginger Baker, as part of Ginger Baker's Air Force, who also featured Winwood's Traffic bandmate Chris Wood. Winwood played on their self-titled first album, released in 1970.
</p><p>In 1972, Winwood recorded the part of Captain Walker in the highly successful orchestral version of the Who's <i>Tommy</i>. He recorded a 1973 album with Remi Kabaka and Abdul Lasisi Amao, as Third World, <i>Aiye-Keta</i>. Later, after the unrelated reggae group Third World had formed, the album was re-released and identified by the band members' names. In 1976, Winwood provided vocals and keyboards on <i>Go</i>, a concept album by Japanese composer Stomu Yamashta. That same year, Winwood also played guitar on the Fania All Stars' <i>Delicate and Jumpy</i> record and performed as a guest with the band in their only UK appearance, a sold-out concert at the Lyceum Theatre, London.
</p><p>Under pressure from Island Records, Winwood released his self-titled first solo album in 1977. In 1979 he played keyboards on the Marianne Faithfull album <i>Broken English,</i> including synthesizer on the tracks "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan" and "Broken English" which were taken as singles from the album.

<p>In 1980, Winwood released his second solo album <i>Arc of a Diver</i>, which included his first solo hit, "While You See a Chance". This was followed by <i>Talking Back to the Night</i> in 1982, which featured the song "Valerie", which would eventually become a hit single upon re-release in 1987. Both <i>Arc of a Diver</i> and <i>Talking Back to the Night</i> were recorded at his home in Gloucestershire with Winwood playing all instruments.
</p><p>In 1986, Winwood travelled to New York City for his next album project. There, he enlisted the help of a coterie of stars to record <i>Back in the High Life</i>. The album went triple platinum in the US, with its first single "Higher Love" reaching number 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and earning Winwood Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. He embarked on an extensive tour of North America in support of the album, and at the end of the tour, he divorced Nicole Weir in England then settled in the Nashville area with his new American wife, Eugenia Crafton.
</p><p>With the exception of 1969's <i>Blind Faith</i>, Winwood had been with Island Records since the Spencer Davis Group's first single in 1964. However, at the peak of his commercial success, Winwood moved to Virgin Records and released the albums <i>Roll with It</i> (1988) and <i>Refugees of the Heart</i> (1990). <i>Roll with It</i> and its title track hit No. 1 on the US album and singles charts in the summer of 1988.

The remix spent five weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.
</p><p>In 2005, Winwood's Soundstage Performances DVD was released. That same year, he appeared on Grammy Award winner Ashley Cleveland's album <i>Men and Angels Say</i>, a mix of rock, blues, and country arrangements of well-known hymns, including "I Need Thee Every Hour", which featured a vocal duet and organ performance.
