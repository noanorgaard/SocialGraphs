<p><b>The Killers</b> are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). After the band went through a number of short-term bassists and drummers, Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined in 2002.
</p><p>The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which topped the UK Albums Chart: <i>Hot Fuss</i> (2004), <i>Sam's Town</i> (2006), <i>Day &amp; Age</i> (2008), <i>Battle Born</i> (2012), <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> (2017), <i>Imploding the Mirage</i> (2020), and <i>Pressure Machine</i> (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities compilation, <i>Sawdust</i> (2007); a live album, <i>Live from the Royal Albert Hall</i> (2009); two greatest-hits albums, <i>Direct Hits</i> (2013) and <i>Rebel Diamonds</i> (2023); and a Christmas compilation, <i>Don't Waste Your Wishes</i> (2016).
</p><p>Since 2016 and 2017, respectively, Stoermer and Keuning have had extended hiatuses from the band. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer participated in recording sessions for <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> and <i>Imploding the Mirage</i>, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording <i>Pressure Machine</i>, which was released in 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton assumed the role of bassist in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards, respectively, live.
</p><p>The Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the U.S. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium, Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019), and Electric Picnic in Ireland in 2023.

<p>In 2001, Brandon Flowers was fired by his first band, a synth-pop trio called Blush Response. After attending an Oasis concert at the Hard Rock Hotel during The Tour of Brotherly Love, Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians. He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by Dave Keuning, a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Las Vegas from Iowa a year earlier. When the pair met, they bonded over similar musical influences and began writing songs together in Keuning's apartment. They named their band the Killers because that was the name of a fictional band in the video for the New Order song "Crystal". In November 2001, they headed to Kill the Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada, along with recently recruited drummer Matt Norcross, to record a demo. They recorded two tracks: "Mr. Brightside", the first song Flowers and Keuning wrote together, and "Desperate". A month later, they recorded two more, "Under the Gun" and "Replaceable", with Keuning's roommate Dell Neal on bass.
</p><p>Keuning and Flowers played their first live show together at an open mic night at the Cafe Espresso Roma in Las Vegas in January 2002; the pair, joined by Neal and Norcross, began playing venues around the city where they handed out free copies of their demo. The Killers brought a unique style to the small Vegas music scene, which was dominated by punk, nu metal, and rap bands; one local reviewer wrote, "The Killers, thankfully, don't come across like any other band in town", and described their sound as a mix between the "pop styles of British music and the lo-fi fuzz of modern indie rock". By the summer of 2002, the Killers, whose early live sound was also described as erratic, had fired Norcross and briefly replaced him with Brian Havens, who was also eventually fired. Bassist Dell Neal later left the band for personal reasons.
</p><p>Ronnie Vannucci Jr. joined the Killers shortly before Neal's departure. Vannucci was well known in the Las Vegas music scene, having played in bands since he was young. He met the Killers in 2002 while he playing in other bands, including Daphne Major and Romance Fantasy. Vannucci's first show with the band was on August 30, 2002, at a club called The Junkyard. Playing bass that night was Mark Stoermer, who was at this point the lead guitarist for local progressive rock band the Negative Ponies. The band wanted Stoermer to join them permanently, but he was initially reluctant. They had first approached him to be the second guitarist when they were considering turning the band into a five-piece, "possibly more like the Strokes, with a keyboard". Stoermer later said he could also play bass. The band had continued as a three-piece, trying out other bassists until November 2002, when Stoermer accepted the invitation to join. According to Ryan Pardey, who booked many of the band's early shows, "They became a great band when Ronnie and Mark joined. That's when they finally became a cohesive unit. What Ronnie did — he was the discipline — and Mark was just a solid musician."
</p>

<p>While walking through a Virgin Megastore in Las Vegas in 2002, Flowers noticed the album artwork on the then-new Elvis Presley compilation album <i>ELV1S: 30 No. 1 Hits</i>. This inspired him to use a marquee sign motif as the band's logo. The band hired Vannucci's roommate's girlfriend to design it, and the logo has been used in the band's branding, releases, promotional materials, and merchandise ever since.
</p><p>The four members worked on song ideas in Vannucci's garage. They also sneaked into the band room at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (where Vannucci was studying classical percussion) at night to practice. During this period, the band wrote much of its debut album, <i>Hot Fuss</i>, including the hit singles "Somebody Told Me" and "Smile Like You Mean It". The band continued playing at small venues around Las Vegas, often playing Sunday nights at the transgender bar Sasha's (later renamed Tramps). They caught the attention of Braden Merrick, an A&amp;R rep for Warner Bros. Records who had come across their demo on a website dedicated to unsigned bands in the Las Vegas area; after attending a live show he offered to help the band find a record deal, and eventually became their manager. He took the band to Berkeley, California, to record demos with former Green Day manager Jeff Saltzman. They sent the demo tapes to major U.S. record labels. The band was invited to perform at a number of showcases but was not signed. But the band caught the eye of Alex Gilbert, an A&amp;R rep from the United Kingdom. Gilbert took a demo with him to the UK and showed it to his friend Ben Durling, who worked at the newly formed Independent label Lizard King Records. Despite not meeting the band in person, Lizard King offered the band a deal based on the strength of the five song demo. The Killers signed with the British label in July 2003.

<p>On August 19, 2003, the song "Mr. Brightside" premiered on DJ Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show in the UK. The Killers traveled to London the following month to spend a week playing at live music venues across the city. On September 29, 2003, the song "Mr. Brightside" was released in the UK on a limited number of CDs and vinyl records. Critical reviews of both the song and the shows were positive: <i>NME</i> noted the band's retro sound, commenting "The Killers steal so smartly, and with such mind-boggling variety". As a result of the buzz generated in the UK, a number of major labels in the US began showing strong interest in the band and they were invited to play at the ASCAP CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. They eventually signed with the record label Island Def Jam.
</p><p>The band finished recording <i>Hot Fuss</i> in November 2003 with Jeff Saltzman. They decided to keep many of the previously recorded demos as they felt they had a spontaneity that re-recordings would not have. Shortly afterwards they returned to London, having been invited to support British Sea Power on their UK tour.  The band also worked with Alan Moulder at Eden Studios and Townhouse Studios mixing tracks for their upcoming album. They continued playing support slots during the first half of 2004, including touring both the US &amp; UK with Stellastarr and opening for Morrissey on two occasions. The band filmed their first music video for the Spring 2004 release of "Somebody Told Me" which was to be the band's debut single in the US and second single in the UK. The band's first headline tour started in the UK in May 2004. During the spring and summer of 2004, the group played well-received sets at festivals across Europe and North America.
</p>

<p>The Killers released their debut album <i>Hot Fuss</i> on June 7, 2004, in the United Kingdom on Lizard King Records and a week later in the United States on Island Records. The track listing differed depending on territory, in the UK and Australia "Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll" replaces "Change Your Mind" as track eight. Upon release <i>Hot Fuss</i> received generally favorable reviews from critics. Extensive touring and the success of the Grammy Award nominated singles "Somebody Told Me", "All These Things That I've Done" and "Mr. Brightside" led to the album becoming a commercial success. <i>Hot Fuss</i> reached number one in the UK in January 2005, seven months after its release, and has been certified 7× Platinum in both the UK and Ireland. It went on to spend more weeks on the UK Albums chart than any other album that decade, 173 weeks in total. In the US, the album reached its peak position of number seven in April 2005 and has been certified 3× Platinum. It reached the top spot in Australia in March 2005, where it was certified 3× Platinum. It has also been certified 3× Platinum in Canada, Platinum in New Zealand and Gold in Argentina, Belgium, Germany and France. "Mr. Brightside" has been downloaded 3.7 million times in the United States as of July 2017 and certified Diamond.
</p><p>The Killers were named the World's Best Selling New Group at the 2005 World Music Awards.  The same year they won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and were also nominated for three Grammy Awards with <i>Hot Fuss</i> being nominated for Best Rock Album. In the UK, they picked up an NME Award for Best International Band. The band was recognized by <i>Rolling Stone</i> as the "best-selling new rock band of the past year" in June 2005. Lead singer Brandon Flowers had also gained media attention, being named both Sexiest and Best Dressed Man at the NME Awards, he had also caused controversy due to some outspoken views on other bands.
</p><p>In July 2005, the Killers performed on the London stage of the Live 8 concert, playing "All These Things That I've Done". Robbie Williams incorporated the song's refrain "I've got soul but I'm not a soldier" into his own performance. Coldplay and U2 followed suit and, at their separate concerts played in Las Vegas, with the Killers in the crowd, incorporated the line into their songs "God Put a Smile Upon Your Face" and "Beautiful Day", respectively.
</p><p>The band fired manager Braden Merrick in 2006. Merrick later filed a lawsuit against the band for breach of contract and their new manager and lawyer, Robert Reynolds, for $16 million each. The band counter sued, citing that Merrick's poor management had cost them millions. The case was settled in 2009.

<p>Shortly after finishing touring for Hot Fuss, the Killers headed back into the studio to start recording their second studio album with producers Alan Moulder and Flood, who were working together for the first time in a decade. <i>Sam's Town</i> was mostly recorded at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas, with finishing touches added to the album at Criterion Studios, London in June 2006. Upon completion of the album, Flowers claimed he felt the band had made "one of the best albums of the past twenty years" and that he wanted the album to capture "everything important that got me to where I am today". In July 2006, the lead single "When You Were Young" was premiered and it became a hit, gaining another two Grammy Award nominations and mostly positive reviews with many bringing attention to the influence of heartland rock on the song.
</p>

<p>The Killers' second album, <i>Sam's Town</i>, was released in October 2006 under Island Def Jam Music Group. It received a varied response with some critics praising the album and the evolution of the band and others criticizing and mocking it, most notably it received a scathing review from <i>Rolling Stone</i>. The album sold over 706,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, reaching number two on the US Billboard chart and number one on the UK chart. The album has since been certified 5× Platinum in the United Kingdom; 4× Platinum in Ireland; 2× Platinum in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; Platinum in the United States and Gold in Argentina, Belgium, Germany, and Russia.
</p><p>
The Killers recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for <i>Live from Abbey Road</i> on November 29, 2006. They performed an almost totally unplugged set, which included stripped back versions of the album's title track "Sam's Town", "When You Were Young" and a rendition of the Dire Straits hit "Romeo and Juliet". In December 2006, the band released a Christmas charity song, "A Great Big Sled", which benefited Product Red. This has since become an annual tradition. </p>
<p>In February 2007, the Killers attended the BRIT Awards in the United Kingdom, where they performed "When You Were Young". The band won two awards — Best International Group &amp; International Album. In the same month, the band's Tim Burton-directed video for the album's second single, "Bones", won Best Video at the NME Awards.
</p><p>The band recorded the video for the album's third single "Read My Mind" in Tokyo, Japan during a break in their Sam's Town Tour. The single release was accompanied by a remix of the song by the Pet Shop Boys. Due to high ticket demand, the Killers began headlining arenas including Madison Square Garden for the first time and also headlined a number of major European festivals during 2007, including Glastonbury Festival.
</p><p>As of July 2017, the Killers have sold 5.3 million copies of both <i>Hot Fuss</i> and <i>Sam's Town</i>.

<p>The band enlisted Stuart Price to produce their third studio album, he had previously remixed their songs under his <i>Jacques Lu Cont</i> moniker, the most notable being the remix of "Mr. Brightside". They first met Price at his London home in 2007 to discuss the possibility of him producing some unreleased tracks for their b-sides album Sawdust, however that same night they ended up in Price's home studio recording a demo of "Human" a new song that would become the eventual lead single from <i>Day &amp; Age</i>. The band took six months apart following the completion of their Sam's Town tour, during this period they would send song ideas between each other and Price via Logic Pro. The band finished recording the album with Price at the band's newly acquired Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas.
</p><p>"Human" was released in October 2008 with Flowers describing the song as "Johnny Cash meets the Pet Shop Boys". The song became a hit worldwide.  The lyric "Are we human, or are we dancer?" confused listeners, due to its grammar and ambiguity. Flowers explained that the line was inspired by a Hunter S. Thompson quote where he stated America was raising "a generation of dancers". It has since been voted by one poll as the most confusing song lyric of all time.
</p>

<p>The Killers' third album, <i>Day &amp; Age</i>, was released on November 18, 2008. Flowers stated that <i>Day &amp; Age</i> was "like looking at Sam's Town from Mars", the band have called it their "most playful record" with the album making use of saxophones, steel drums, harpsichord, and tribal chanting. The album also saw the band write some of their most personal and challenging lyrics to date.  Closing track "Goodnight, Travel Well" was written about the death of Keuning's mother, while "A Dustland Fairytale" was written as a tribute to frontman Flowers' parents, his mother had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. <i>Day &amp; Age</i> became the band's third studio album to reach number one in both the UK and Ireland, it reached number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart. It has also been certified 4× Platinum in the UK and Ireland, Platinum in Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Canada and Gold in the US, Mexico, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, Greece and the Middle East.
</p>

<p>The band embarked on the Day &amp; Age World Tour, during which they performed on every continent and headlined US festivals Lollapalooza and Coachella for the first time. The tour was named one of the top 50 worldwide concert tours of 2009.

It was released in November and played at various cinemas across the globe. <i>Live from the Royal Albert Hall</i> was certified 2× Platinum in the UK, Platinum in the US and Australia and Gold in Ireland and Brazil.
</p><p>In January 2010, the band announced that they would take a short break after being on the road for the better part of six years. The break lasted for about a year and a half, during which band members devoted themselves on solo projects, while the band made sporadic other contributions. In late February 2010, Flowers' mother died from brain cancer. This resulted in the cancellation of dates in Asia. Two Australian dates in Sydney and Perth were also cancelled; however, both the Gold Coast and Melbourne concerts went ahead, with the Day &amp; Age tour finally coming to a close in Melbourne on February 21 when the Killers were the headline act of the Good Vibrations Festival at Flemington Racecourse.

During an interview with <i>NME</i> Flowers confirmed they have been working on their eighth album, stating there would be more single releases in 2022 leading to the album's release early 2023.
</p><p>On August 15, 2023, the band performed at the Black Sea Arena in Shekvetili, Georgia. During a performance of the song "For Reasons Unknown", the band attracted controversy as they invited a fan, who happened to be Russian, from the crowd on stage to help them perform the song. This was followed by booing by some parts of the crowd. The band's lead singer Brandon Flowers tried to defuse the tensions by saying that all Killers fans are "brothers and sisters". Some parts of the audience left in protest. The band later shared an apology on their social media, saying that they did not want to insult anyone and their message about friendship was misconstrued amid the political tensions between Russia and Georgia and the occupation of Georgian territories by Russia. Later that month, Flowers confirmed that the eighth album had been scrapped due to his dissatisfaction with its direction, stating "I don’t think you’ll see us making this type of music any more."
</p><p>On December 8, 2023, the band released its second greatest hits compilation, <i>Rebel Diamonds</i>, which included three songs from the aborted eighth studio album: "Boy", "Your Side of Town" and "Spirit". On December 25, the band previewed a fourth new song, named "We Did It in the Name of Love," which remained otherwise unreleased.

<p>In August 2024, the original four-piece of Flowers, Keuning, Stoermer, and Vannucci Jr. reunited for a fifteen-night concert residency, celebrating the 20th anniversary of <i>Hot Fuss</i>. The reunited line-up performed the album in full each night, and recorded a brand new song, "Bright Lights", to coincide with the residency. The song was the first to feature all four core members since 2017.
