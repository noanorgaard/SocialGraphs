<p><b>Scorpions</b> are a German hard rock band formed in Hanover in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker. The longest-running and most successful line-up of the band included Schenker, Klaus Meine (vocals), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass), and Herman Rarebell (drums), and lasted from 1978 to 1992. The band's only continuous member has been Schenker, although Meine has been with the band continuously since 1969, while Jabs has been a consistent member since 1978 and bassist Paweł Mąciwoda and drummer Mikkey Dee have been in the band, since 2003 and 2016, respectively.
</p><p>The band's debut album, <i>Lonesome Crow</i> (1972), featured Schenker's younger brother Michael on lead guitar, before he departed to join UFO. He was replaced by Uli Jon Roth, who played with the band on their next four studio albums, <i>Fly to the Rainbow</i> (1974), <i>In Trance</i> (1975), <i>Virgin Killer</i> (1976) and <i>Taken by Force</i> (1977), and their first live album <i>Tokyo Tapes</i> (1978). Following Roth's departure, the band recruited Matthias Jabs and began moving towards a more melodic rock style on their sixth studio album <i>Lovedrive</i> (1979), which also saw Scorpions reunite briefly with Michael Schenker before he left again to begin a solo career. Over the next decade, the band achieved influence, approval from music critics, and significant commercial success with the albums <i>Animal Magnetism</i> (1980), <i>Blackout</i> (1982), <i>Love at First Sting</i> (1984), the live album <i>World Wide Live</i> (1985), <i>Savage Amusement</i> (1988), the compilation album <i>Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads</i> (1989) and <i>Crazy World</i> (1990), all of which are certified at least platinum in the United States. The band has released thirteen consecutive studio albums that were in the top 10 in Germany, one of which reached No. 1, as well as three consecutive albums that were in the top 10 in the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in the United States. Their latest studio album, <i>Rock Believer</i>, was released in February 2022.
</p><p>Scorpions are estimated to have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling hard rock and heavy metal bands. One of their most recognized hits is "Wind of Change" (from <i>Crazy World</i>), a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it remains as one of the best-selling singles in the world with over 14 million copies. Two songs from their ninth studio album <i>Love at First Sting</i>, "Rock You Like a Hurricane" and "Still Loving You", are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works, both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads, defined as "rock anthem" and "a true hymn of love", respectively.

<p>Rudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm/lead guitarist, launched the band in 1965. Initially the band had Merseybeat influences and Schenker himself handled the vocals. He played in a band with Lothar Heimberg before he founded Scorpions. Karl Heinz Vollmer left the band in 1967 because of his military obligations; military service precluded him from performing in concerts. Things began to come together in 1969 when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine, who had played together in the Led Zeppelin and Taste cover band Copernicus, joined the band. With this line-up they won a music contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never released on the CCA label, but the songs, "Action" and "I'm Going Mad" were later released on different compilation albums including <i>Psychedelic Gems 2.</i>
</p><p>In 1972 the group recorded and released their debut album, <i>Lonesome Crow</i>, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and re-recorded their CCA songs. During the <i>Lonesome Crow</i> tour Scorpions opened for up-and-coming British band UFO. Near the end of the tour, guitarist Michael Schenker accepted an offer to play lead guitar for UFO. Uli Jon Roth, a friend of Michael's, was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour.
</p><p>The departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, Uli Roth, who had helped Scorpions complete the <i>Lonesome Crow</i> tour, was offered the role of lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions line-up. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and Jürgen Rosenthal (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known on the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.

<p>In 1974, the new line-up released <i>Fly to the Rainbow</i>. The album proved to be more successful than <i>Lonesome Crow</i> and songs such as "Speedy's Coming" and the title track established the band's sound. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, Jürgen Rosenthal had to leave as he was drafted into the army (he later joined German progressive rock band Eloy, recording three albums). Rosenthal was replaced in July 1974 by Jürgen Fechter, and then in 1975 Rudy Lenners from Belgium became the band's next drummer.
</p><p>That year, the band released <i>In Trance</i>, which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as "In Trance", "Dark Lady" and "Robot Man".
</p><p>Meanwhile, as "The Hunters", the band recorded "Fuchs geh' voran" and "Wenn es richtig losgeht", German language cover versions of "Action" and "Fox on the Run" by the Sweet for EMI's Electrola label.
</p><p>In 1976, the Scorpions released <i>Virgin Killer</i>, the album cover of which featured a nude prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager for the West German division of RCA Records, their label at the time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure as well as controversy and was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries because of its imagery. The album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the cover art on the English Wikipedia was briefly blacklisted by the Internet Watch Foundation, before reversing their decision 4 days later.
</p><p>The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by Herman Rarebell, an experienced musician who had recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and Onyx.
</p><p>For the follow-up <i>Taken by Force</i>, RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, "Steamrock Fever", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album <i>Tokyo Tapes</i>. <i>Tokyo Tapes</i> was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias Jabs, a veteran of the German rock scene who had played in the bands Lady and Fargo.

<p>Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records in the United States and EMI Records worldwide to record their next album <i>Lovedrive</i> (1979). Just weeks after quitting UFO, Michael Schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists. <i>Lovedrive</i> was an album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career. Containing such fan favourites as "Loving You Sunday Morning", "Always Somewhere", "Holiday" and the instrumental "Coast to Coast", it firmly cemented the "Scorpions formula" of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads. Although it had been widely believed for decades that Michael Schenker's contribution to the record was only limited to three songs, he vehemently maintained he appeared on the whole album during an interview with satellite radio host Eddie Trunk. The album's provocative artwork was named "Best album sleeve of 1979" by <i>Playboy</i> magazine, yet ultimately changed for American release. <i>Lovedrive</i> reached No. 55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However, in April 1979, during their tour in France, Michael quit again and Jabs was brought in permanently to replace him.
</p><p>In 1980, the band released <i>Animal Magnetism</i>, again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a Doberman Pinscher sitting in front of a man. <i>Animal Magnetism</i> contained classics such as "The Zoo" and "Make It Real". Soon after the album's release, Meine began experiencing throat problems. He required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised about whether he would ever sing again.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the band began working on their next album, <i>Blackout</i> in 1981. A then-unknown Don Dokken was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals, while Meine recovered. Meine's voice eventually healed completely and he was able to finish recording the album. <i>Blackout</i> was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling album to date, eventually going platinum. Meine's voice showed no signs of weakness and reviews for the album were positive. <i>Blackout</i> spawned two singles: "No One Like You" and "Can't Live Without You".
</p><p>Gaining in popularity from the success of <i>Blackout</i>, the Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day US Festival concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.
</p><p>The 1984 album <i>Love at First Sting</i> cemented the Scorpions' status as an internationally popular band. Propelled by the single "Rock You Like a Hurricane", <i>Love at First Sting</i> climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.
</p><p>MTV gave the album's videos "Rock You Like a Hurricane", "I'm Leaving You", "Big City Nights", and the power ballad "Still Loving You" significant airplay, greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname "The Ambassadors of Rock", to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine named them "The Heroes of Heavy Metal".
</p><p>The band toured extensively behind <i>Love at First Sting</i> and released their second live album, <i>World Wide Live</i> in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No. 14 in the charts in the US and at No. 18 in the UK.
</p><p>After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio, to record <i>Savage Amusement</i>. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, <i>Savage Amusement</i> represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British rock and metal magazine <i>Kerrang!</i> did award the album five K's out of five.
</p><p>On the <i>Savage Amusement</i> tour in 1988, the Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the Soviet Union. Uriah Heep had performed in the country earlier in December 1987, in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. As a result, the Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform. Also in 1989, Scorpions released the compilation album <i>Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads</i>, which, in addition to the band's hits from 1979 to 1988, included several rare or previously unreleased tracks: "Hey You", from the <i>Lovedrive</i> sessions; a remixed version of "Is There Anybody There?"; and a cover of the Who's "I Can't Explain", which was also included on that same year's <i>Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell</i> charity compilation album. This is the band's only compilation album, to be certified platinum in the United States.
</p><p>Wishing to distance themselves from the <i>Savage Amusement</i> style, the band parted ways with their long-time producer and "Sixth Scorpion", Dieter Dierks, replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. <i>Crazy World</i> was released that year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad "Wind of Change". The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world at the end of the Cold War. <i>Crazy World</i> remains the band's last album, to receive gold or platinum certification in the United States. On 21 July 1990, they joined many other guests for Roger Waters' massive performance of <i>The Wall</i> in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of "In the Flesh" from <i>The Wall</i>.
</p><p>After the <i>Crazy World</i> tour, the band's long-serving bassist Francis Buchholz, left the group.

<p>In 1993, the Scorpions released <i>Face the Heat</i>. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album's sound was more metal than melodic. Neither the heavy metal single "Alien Nation" nor the ballad "Under the Same Sun" came close to matching the success of "Wind of Change". <i>Face the Heat</i> was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album, <i>Live Bites</i>, was produced. The disc documented retro live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, <i>World Wide Live</i>, it was not as successful.
</p><p>Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's <i>Pure Instinct</i>, drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label. Curt Cress took charge of the drumsticks for the album before Louisville, Kentucky-born James Kottak took over permanently. The album had many ballads. Still, the album's singles "Wild Child" and the soothing ballad "You and I" both enjoyed moderate success.
</p><p>1999 saw the release of <i>Eye II Eye</i> and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the album's first European single, "To Be No. 1", featured a Monica Lewinsky look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.
</p><p>The following year, the Scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic that resulted in a 10-song album named <i>Moment of Glory</i>. The album went a long way toward rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of <i>Eye II Eye</i>. However, critics accused them of following on the coattails of Metallica's similar collaboration (<i>S&amp;M</i>) with the San Francisco Symphony which had been released the previous year, even though the orchestra had first approached the Scorpions with the idea in 1995.
</p>

<p>In 2001, the Scorpions released <i>Acoustica</i>, a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and <i>Acoustica</i> did little to return the band to the spotlight.
</p><p>In 2004, the band released <i>Unbreakable</i>, an album that was hailed by critics as a long-awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since <i>Face the Heat</i>. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, <i>Unbreakable</i> received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as "Special Guests" with Judas Priest during the 2005 British tour—these were the Scorpions' first dates in the UK since 1999.
</p><p>In early 2006, the Scorpions released the DVD <i>1 Night in Vienna</i> that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary. In LA, the band spent about four months in the studio with producers James Michael and Desmond Child working on a concept album titled <i>Humanity: Hour I</i>, which was released in late May 2007, and was followed by the "Humanity World Tour".
</p>

<p>In 2007, the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series, <i>Guitar Hero</i>. "No One Like You" was featured on the <i>Rocks the '80s</i> version of the game while "Rock You Like A Hurricane" was released on <i>Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock</i>.
</p><p>On 14 May 2007, the Scorpions released <i>Humanity – Hour I</i> in Europe. <i>Humanity – Hour I</i> became available in the U.S. on 28 August on New Door Records, entering the <i>Billboard</i> charts at number No. 63.
</p><p>In a September 2007 podcast interview, Meine said the album was not so much a "concept album", but rather a collection of songs with a common theme. "We didn't want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls. I mean, come on, give me a break," Meine said.
</p><p>Asked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a <i>Humanity – Hour II</i>, Meine replied:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>That is what everybody is asking. There might be. Who knows? Right now we are at the beginning of the world tour. It is exciting to play the new songs and they go very well with the classics. It is exciting that there is a whole new audience out there. There are many longtime fans but there are a lot of young kids. We just played in London and in Paris and there were young kids rocking out to songs that were written way before they were born. It is amazing. I don't want to think about <i>Hour II</i> right now because <i>Hour I</i> is so exciting. It is very inspiring to see how much the audience enjoys this new music.</p></blockquote>
<p>On 20 December 2007, the Scorpions played at a concert for the elite of Russia's security forces in the Kremlin. The concert was a celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Cheka—predecessor of the KGB. The band claimed they thought they were performing a Christmas concert. They said their concert was by no means a tribute to the Cheka, communism, or Russia's brutal past. Members of the audience included Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev.
</p><p>On 22 February 2009, the band received Germany's ECHO Honorary Award for lifetime achievement at Berlin's O2 World.

<p>In November 2009, the Scorpions announced their 17th studio album, <i>Sting in the Tail</i>, would be released in early 2010, recorded in Hanover with Swedish producers Mikael "Nord" Andersson and Martin Hansen. It was released on 23 March 2010.
</p><p>On 24 January 2010, the band announced their initial intentions for <i>Sting in the Tail</i> to be their last album, and the tour supporting it their final tour, although the band later made the decision to continue recording past the end of the tour. Dokken was scheduled to open for them but cancelled after a dispute.
</p>

<p>On 6 April 2010, they were enshrined in Hollywood's Rock Walk in a handprint ceremony, with the band members placing their hands in a long slab of wet cement next to other musical artists.
</p><p>An album of re-recordings of older songs, <i>Comeblack</i>, was released on 7 November 2011.
</p><p>Meine was asked in a July 2011 interview about the future of the Scorpions. He replied, "Our newest project comes out in the next few months. It gives you a chance to experience the Scorpions in 3D. You can actually feel the smoke string out of the guitar like it is a live show. It is an incredible experience. The DVD features our concerts in 3D in Germany. We are just about to do the mix and it should be in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia hopefully soon. Indeed, the strong 3D technology makes us feel like pioneers after all these years [he says, laughing]. We have an album coming out later this year featuring classics. You know our love for them. The '60s was the era for our inspiration. Our movie/documentary also is soon to be released. We have cameras with us on tours, so this documentary is being made during our tours. It also gives you a picture of the Scorpions career and journey."
</p>

<p>Despite initial plans for a break up or retirement, guitarist Matthias Jabs told AZ Central on 12 June 2012 that the Scorpions would not split up. A month later, Jabs told <i>Billboard</i> magazine the band had been working on an album that would contain unreleased songs they recorded for the albums <i>Blackout</i>, <i>Love at First Sting</i>, <i>Savage Amusement</i>, and <i>Crazy World</i> and planned to release it in 2014. In April, the Scorpions announced shows in Russia and Belarus with an orchestra in October 2013. On 11, 12, and 14 September 2013, the band played three MTV Unplugged concerts at the Lycabettus-Theatre in Athens. On 6 November 2013, they announced four more MTV Unplugged Concert in Germany 2014. In December 2013, in an interview at Rock Show radio program in Greece, Meine said he was not sure if the album with unreleased songs they recorded for the albums <i>Blackout</i>, <i>Love at First Sting</i>, <i>Savage Amusement</i> and <i>Crazy World</i> would be released in 2014 or later on.
</p><p>In 2013, the band released the album <i>MTV Unplugged in Athens</i>. The album featured classic songs like <i>Rock You Like a Hurricane</i> and <i>Big City Nights</i> done acoustically, but also included rare live performances of songs like <i>When The Smoke Is Going Down</i> and <i>Where the River Flows</i>.
On 16 August 2014, they announced a new album in the works, due for release sometime in 2015.
</p><p>In 2014, the Scorpions were nominated for two Echo Awards ("Euro Grammys") for their MTV Unplugged.

<p>On 23 October 2014, Meine spoke to the band's French fan-club Crazyscorps, and announced the new record would be published in February or March 2015, to coincide with the band's 50th anniversary. Contrary to what the band said in 2013, the new album presented not only newly recorded versions of never-published songs, but also new material, written between 2011 and 2014.
The album was recorded in Sweden, with producers Martin Hansen and Mikael Nord Andersson. Drummer James Kottak, who left the band in May 2014 for rehab, returned to play drums. The new album <i>Return to Forever</i> was released on 20 February 2015.
</p>

<p>On 29 August 2015, the Scorpions announced 50th anniversary deluxe editions of their albums <i>Taken By Force</i>, <i>Tokyo Tapes</i>, <i>Lovedrive</i>, <i>Animal Magnetism</i>, <i>Blackout</i>, <i>Love at First Sting</i>, <i>World Wide Live</i>, and <i>Savage Amusement</i> which were released 6 November 2015. These deluxe releases include "dozens of unreleased songs, alternate versions of big hits, rough mixes, and rare live concert recordings". On 28 April 2016, it was announced that former Motörhead drummer Mikkey Dee would fill in for James Kottak and play drums on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed "Scorpions Blacked Out in Las Vegas" with Queensrÿche opening the Vegas shows, and dates in São Paulo. On 12 September 2016, Dee was officially announced as the band's new permanent drummer.
</p><p>On 18 January 2017, the Scorpions were inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for leading the two-guitar attack in heavy metal. Proceeds from the ceremony benefitted the Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund.

<p>In an August 2018 interview with Digital Journal, Scorpions guitarist Rudolf Schenker stated that the band was open to the idea of recording a follow-up to <i>Return to Forever</i>. He explained: "We are still waiting for a moment for inspiration to do another album, like Judas Priest and Metallica did. You have to wait until the time is right." Klaus Meine hinted in May 2019 that "there might be a new album out in 2020."
</p><p>On 28 April 2020, Scorpions released (on their YouTube channel) a new (2-minute 16-second short) song entitled "Sign of Hope", inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>On 25 July 2020, Scorpions entered Peppermint Park Studios in Hanover to resume working on their nineteenth studio album. The album's initial sessions, which were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, were done remotely, with producer Greg Fidelman participating via Zoom; however, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed in a March 2021 interview with Robb Flynn of Machine Head that the band had to abandon their plans to work with Fidelman, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Progress on the album had continued to be slow by August 2021, when Scorpions posted a video on Facebook from the studio where they rehearsed a new song (possibly titled "Seventh Sun") for an upcoming tour.
</p><p>On 29 September 2021, Scorpions announced <i>Rock Believer</i> as the title of their nineteenth studio album and set 11 February 2022 as its release date; the band later pushed back the release of the album to two weeks after its initially planned release date. They supported the album with a European tour with Mammoth WVH and a North American tour with Thundermother and Whitesnake, as part of the latter's farewell tour.
</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, they collaborated with Japanese rock star Yoshiki to perform "Wind of Change" for the documentary film <i>Yoshiki: Under the Sky.</i> This was the first time the band came together to perform the Ukraine version of the song. The performance was later released as a music video on YouTube.
</p><p>In December 2023, it was also announced that the band would return to Turkey for the first time in eight years to perform a live show in Istanbul in May 2024. On October 24th, 2024, the band gave a press conference in Hanover at which a concert on July 5, 2025 at the Heinz-von-Heiden-Arena was announced for the 60th anniversary under the motto "Coming Home to Hannover Scorpions and Friends". Rosy Vista, Bülent Caylen, Alice Cooper and Judas Priest appeared as special guests.
</p><p>In February 2025, when asked if Scorpions were planning to make a 20th studio album, Meine stated that "there are a million good reasons to go back into the studio sometime soon. But, on the other side, these days, it's not the time anymore really to make albums." He did not rule out recording a "few songs", and added that the band will discuss working on new music "before [they] make plans for what might come up" in 2026.
