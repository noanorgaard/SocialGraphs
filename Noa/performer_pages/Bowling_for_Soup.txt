<p>Bowling for Soup has its origins in Wichita Falls, Texas, where Jaret Reddick and other members of the band grew up. Reddick and original drummer Lance Morrill met in the fall of 1976. Reddick began playing music in 1985, at 13 years old. Reddick and guitarist Chris Burney knew each other in high school (they met in 1986) and as students in the 1980s, they grew up on the commercially successful heavy metal music of bands such as Quiet Riot, RATT, and Mötley Crüe, but were also influenced by the faster punk rock of the Ramones and later Green Day. Burney's family owned a Wichita Falls coffeehouse called "The Refuge"  with a music stage and he played there with his first band, the Persecuted, where he and Reddick met bassist Erik Chandler and drummer Gary Wiseman in the early 1990s (although Wiseman did not join the band until 1998).
</p><p>Burney and Chandler soon formed the Folkadots, while Wiseman formed Gary &amp; the Wiseman. Burney and Chandler, along with Morrill, also formed the band Slaw. Around this time, Reddick formed the band Terminal Seasons. Not too long after, Reddick and Morrill formed coolfork! which Burney later joined. The band was in full swing by 1993, playing such venues as the Refuge. A few months later, after forming a band called Rubberneck, the group changed their name to Bowling for Soup, which was derived from the phrase "bowling for shit" from a comedy act by Steve Martin, and the band was officially formed in Wichita Falls on June 4, 1994, by Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Burney (guitar, backing vocals), Chandler (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar), and Morrill (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Morrill left the band on good terms and was replaced in July 1998 by Wiseman.
</p><p>In 1996, Bowling for Soup relocated to Denton, Texas, and released a split album, Cell Mates, with Denton band The V.I.M.S that same year, and in 1998 released their second studio album (and third overall), <i>Rock on Honorable Ones!!</i> for the Denton music label FFROE. The group released its first EP, <i>Tell Me When to Whoa</i>, through FFROE later that year. The album sold over 10,000 copies, prompting Jive Records to sign the band. As a side project, beginning around 1999 until May 2018, Reddick and Chandler performed acoustic shows at smaller venues and showcases, playing primarily Bowling for Soup songs in an acoustic fashion, billed as Jaret &amp; Erik.

<p><i>Let's Do It for Johnny!!</i>, Bowling for Soup's major label debut, was released on Jive in 2000. The album mostly contained re-recordings of the group's previous material along with a few new tracks and a cover of Bryan Adams' song "Summer of '69". <i>Drunk Enough to Dance</i> is Bowling for Soup's second album with Jive Records, released August 6, 2002. It was recorded at Tree Sound Studios and Sonica Recording in Atlanta and Big Time Audio in Dallas. One of the album's two singles, "Girl All The Bad Guys Want" (the other single was "Emily"), was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2003 in the "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal" category. Reddick considers the Grammies one of his shining moments, not for the nomination, but for winning "worst dressed" from Joan Rivers.
</p><p>A re-release in 2003 added "Punk Rock 101", a cover of the 1980s new wave band A Flock of Seagulls' "I Ran (So Far Away)", and "Star Song". An acoustic version of the song "Belgium" exists at the end of the album, as well as at the very end of the initial release. The cover of "I Ran (So Far Away)" was used as the opening theme song of the anime television show <i>Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac</i> in North America.
</p><p>The band appeared in the 2002 film <i>Crossroads</i>, playing at a graduation party.

<p><i>A Hangover You Don't Deserve</i> was released on September 14, 2004, and has become the band's only Top 40 album. Sales of the album were driven in large part by the radio airplay of the single "1985", a song written by Mitch Allan of SR-71 and covered by Bowling For Soup with his permission.  Bowling for Soup did make some modifications to the lyrics to better fit their style with Mitch Allan, lead vocalist of SR-71, contributed backing vocals to the song and appeared in the music video. "1985" became Bowling for Soup's biggest hit in the U.S., reaching No. 23 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. A second single from <i>A Hangover You Don't Deserve</i>, "Almost", charted on the UK Singles Chart, No. 46 on the U.S. Top 100, and No. 23 on U.S. Pop 100. "Ohio", better known as "Come Back to Texas", was released as a radio single in the U.S., but was not as popular as "1985" or "Almost", reaching only No. 59 on the U.S. Pop 100.
</p><p><i>Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies</i>, a compilation album of cover songs and contributions to movie soundtracks, was released by the band in 2005. Later that year, Reddick and Burney made several appearances on VH1's <i>I Love the '90s: Part Deux</i>. Bowling for Soup appeared briefly at the start of the 2005 film <i>Cursed</i>, playing the song "Li'l Red Riding Hood". The group's cover version of Modern English's "I Melt With You" was used in the Disney movie <i>Sky High</i> and was on the movie's soundtrack album. A music video of the song was made, which aired on the Disney Channel and is included on the movie's DVD.
</p><p>The group went on the <i>Star 102.1 StarJam</i> tour with Simple Plan in 2006 and were the opening act. They joined again the following year with Quietdrive and Army of Freshmen.
</p><p>Bowling for Soup spent most of 2006 readying <i>The Great Burrito Extortion Case</i>, the group's seventh album, which was released on November 7, 2006. The group released the first single from that album, "High School Never Ends", to iTunes on September 19, 2006. The song did sell well at first, and Jive Records pulled promotion for it, releasing "When We Die" as a single. Online demand grew steadily for "High School Never Ends", prompting Reddick to express regret for not standing up for its initial release. He said the song has "a poetic quality... that everyone can relate to." The UK release of the album was on February 5, 2007.
</p><p>In 2006, the band embarked on The Get Happy Tour, which was set up as a joint venture with alongside Army of Freshmen.

The tour included Bowling for Soup as main headliners, Wheatus, Son of Dork and Army of Freshmen on the 12 date trek, which concluded at Hammersmith Palais in London, on the February 18.
</p><p>The band released "I'm Gay" as the second UK single in early 2007. The release was on CD and 7" vinyl. A music video for the single was released in the UK, made up of live performances of the song from the "Get Happy Tour", of which the band had performed in the UK during February 2007. On September 25, 2007, it was announced on the official Bowling for Soup forums that "When We Die" would be released as a download only single in the UK on October 22, 2007, as the third single. Following this, the music video was added to the Kerrang television playlist and was played on Scuzz TV.

<p>On January 20, 2009, Reddick released a video onto the web via the band's Myspace page and both YouTube accounts about a new album by the group.

Main support on the tour came from Zebrahead, with additional support coming from MC Lars (who is signed to Reddick's <i>Crappy Records</i>) and the Leftovers.

</p><p>Ultimate Guitar senior editor David Slavković named Bowling for Soup the fifteenth "weirdest band name of all time," highlighting a quote from one of the site's users who asked: "Are they bowling to obtain soup, or are they bowling in the name of soup?"

<p>Bowling for Soup's hit song "1985" was originally written by SR-71's Mitch Allan. According to Reddick, Allan showed the song to him and instructed him to take it as his own, as it seemed more of a Bowling for Soup song than an SR-71 song. Bowling for Soup worked closely with the alternative band Army of Freshmen. In the video for "High School Never Ends" the boy clapping can be seen wearing an Army of Freshmen T-shirt, and Army of Freshmen themselves can be seen as part of the BFS Marching Band. Reddick does guest vocals on four tracks on Army of Freshmen's album <i>Under the Radar</i>.
</p><p>In 2003, fellow Texan punk rockers Junior opened for Bowling for Soup when the group played the club Trees in Deep Ellum. Reddick later co-wrote the song "She's So Amazing" for the band's album <i>Are We Famous Yet?</i>, and lends vocals as well. The Irish pop rock singer Lesley Roy lend her vocals for Bowling for Soup's song "Much More Beautiful Person" from the album <i>The Great Burrito Extortion Case</i>. Both Roy and Bowling for Soup were assigned to the same record label. Reddick is friends with MC Lars, and has lent his vocals for MC Lars' single "Download This Song". MC Lars was a part of Reddick's label Crappy Records. In 2009, Bowling for Soup cameoed in the music video "Telephone Operator" by the Leftovers, who were also a part of Crappy Records.
</p><p>In 2001, Bowling for Soup performed the theme song for the Nickelodeon film <i>Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</i>. The group's version of the theme was based on the previously written television series theme song written by Brian Causey of <i>Man Or Astro-man?</i>. Also in 2001, Reddick wrote the lyrics for "Greatest Day" for the film <i>Max Keeble's Big Move</i> while the band did the music. Bowling for Soup also performed the theme "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day" for the Disney Channel cartoon <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>, Reddick stars in the episode "Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together" where he is the lead vocalist of a fictional band called "Love Händel". The band itself also appeared in animated form in the episode "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" in which the band performed an alternate version of the show's theme with Phineas and Ferb for their futuristic nephews. On Cartoon Network, Reddick and Chandler both played an acoustic show in 2006. And in August 2008 Reddick and Chandler filmed an exclusive video for <i>Total Guitar</i> magazine in the UK called "How To Write A Song In 5 Minutes". In 2008,  Reddick teamed up with SEGA to work on the theme song for <i>Sonic Unleashed</i>, titled "Endless Possibility".
</p><p>New Zealand band 48May ran into legal issues and decided to take the song "Leather and Tattoos" off of the group's debut album, due to the melody sounding very similar to "Punk Rock 101". The album was replaced with a "tour edition" of the CD with the questionable song missing.
</p><p>In 2006, Bowling for Soup covered Fergie's "London Bridge" for Pepsi Smash Cover Art on Yahoo! videos.
</p><p>In 2008, Reddick co-arranged co-wrote and produced the singles "SUV" and "Girls + Summer = Fun!" with solo artist Christy Darlington, and Erik Chandler and Gary Wiseman performed on the recordings as well. These songs were subsequently released digitally. This collaboration resulted from Bowling for Soup and Darlington having performed concerts together and knowing each other since the late 1990s in the Dallas music scene and mutual respect and appreciation for each other's music.
</p><p>In 2014, Bowling for Soup covered the Green Day song "St. Jimmy" for the album <i>Kerrang! Does Green Day's American Idiot</i>.

<p>It became a running gag in Bowling for Soup's music videos to feature previous songs of the band as an introduction for the video. This can be seen in "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", "Emily", and "High School Never Ends", which feature music from "The Bitch Song", "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", and "1985" respectively.
