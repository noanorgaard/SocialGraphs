<p>George Lawrence Thorogood was born on February 24, 1950 in Wilmington, Delaware. He was raised in a middle class family. He attended Brandywine High School where he met and became friends with future drummer and bandmate Jeff Simon. Thorogood showed interest in baseball at a young age, playing semi-professional baseball as a second and first baseman. Thorogood first discovered slide guitar when a friend gifted him a slide for his birthday.

<p>Thorogood began his career as a solo acoustic performer in the style of Robert Johnson and Elmore James in 1970, after being inspired by a John P. Hammond concert. He traveled to San Francisco, California and performed on the streets before a tape of one of his sets got into the hands of Bonnie Raitt's manager. He convinced Thorogood to come back to the East Coast. There he started playing with blues artists Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Eventually, Robert Lockwood advised Thorogood to get an electric guitar, and in December 1973, he formed a band, "the Delaware Destroyers", with high school friend and drummer Jeff Simon. With additional players, the Delaware Destroyers developed its sound, a mixture of Chicago blues and rock and roll. The band's first shows were in the Rathskeller bar at the University of Delaware and at Deer Park Tavern, both in Newark, Delaware. Eventually, the band's name was shortened to just "the Destroyers". During this time, Thorogood supplemented his income by working as a roadie for Hound Dog Taylor.
</p><p>Thorogood recorded a 20-song demo in 1974; 10 of those songs were eventually released as <i>Better Than The Rest</i> by MCA Records. John Forward discovered the band in 1975, and helped them secure a recording contract with Rounder Records. The band's major recording debut came with the album <i>George Thorogood and the Destroyers,</i> which was released on August 16, 1977. The next year, Thorogood released his next album with the Destroyers titled <i>Move It on Over</i>, which included a remake of Hank Williams's "Move It on Over", and a reworking of the Bo Diddley song "Who Do You Love", both released as singles in 1978 and 1979 respectively. In 1980, rhythm guitarist Ron "Roadblock" Smith left the band, and was replaced by saxophonist Hank "Hurricane" Carter, who first played with the band on their fourth studio album, <i>More George Thorogood and the Destroyers.</i> The band's early success contributed to the rise of folk label Rounder Records.
</p><p>During the late 1970s, Thorogood and his band were based in Boston. He was friends with Jimmy Thackery of the Washington, D.C.–based blues band, The Nighthawks. While touring in the 1970s, the Destroyers and the Nighthawks were playing shows in Georgetown at venues across the street from each other. The Destroyers were engaged at the Cellar Door and the Nighthawks at Desperados. At midnight, while both bands played Elmore James's "Madison Blues" in the same key, Thorogood and Thackery left their clubs, met in the middle of M Street, exchanged guitar cords and went on to play with the opposite band in the other club. The connection with the Nighthawks was extended further when Nighthawks bass player Jan Zukowski supported Thorogood's set with Bo Diddley and Albert Collins at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 1985.
</p><p>Thorogood gained his first mainstream exposure as a support act for the Rolling Stones during their 1981 U.S. tour. During this time, Thorogood and the Destroyers became known for their rigorous touring schedule, including the "50/50" tour in 1981, on which the band toured all 50 US states in 50 days. After two shows in Boulder, Colorado, Thorogood and his band flew to Hawaii for one show and then performed a show in Alaska the following night. The next day, Thorogood and his band met his roadies in Washington and continued the one-show-per-state tour. In addition, he played Washington, D.C., on the same day that he performed a show in Maryland, thereby playing 51 shows in 50 days.

<p>With his contract with Rounder Records expiring, Thorogood signed with EMI America Records and in 1982, released <i>Bad to the Bone</i>, which went gold. The album's title track eventually became the band's most well-known song through appearances on MTV and use in films, television and commercials. Later that year he was the featured musical guest on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (Season 8, Episode 2) on the October 2, 1982, broadcast. The next year, the Destroyers embarked on their "Around the World in 80 Days Tour", during which they toured Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Europe and the US, but the tour had to be ended early because of a riot at a festival in Spain. Later that year, Thorogood released his only Christmas song, "Rock and Roll Christmas". It was written by Thorogood as a holiday special for MTV, with John Lee Hooker appearing in the music video. The band's next two studio albums were also certified gold.
</p><p>His sixth studio album was <i>Maverick</i>, released in January 1985. The album featured Thorogood's only song to reach the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, a remake of Johnny Otis's "Willie and the Hand Jive", which peaked at number 63, and his concert staple "I Drink Alone". During this time Thorogood became heavily interested in country music. He intended to record a country album, but never did. EMI America released Thorogood's first live album, titled <i>Live</i>, in August 1986. The album was one of Thorogood's most successful, eventually being certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1988, rhythm guitarist Steve Chrismar joined the band, and was featured on their next album, <i>Born to Be Bad</i>, also released in 1988. That summer he also toured with American musician Brian Setzer. Thorogood and the Destroyers were at the height of their popularity during the 80's, with their 4 albums with EMI selling a combined total of 3.5 million copies.
</p><p>Thorogood's popularity began to decline in the 1990s. His eighth studio album, <i>Boogie People</i>, only sold around 300,000 copies, but it did contain the song "If You Don't Start Drinkin' (I'm Gonna Leave)", which eventually became a concert staple. That year he also toured with Elvin Bishop in support of Bishop's album <i>Don't Let the Bossman Get You Down!</i>. The next year, <i>The Baddest of George Thorogood and the Destroyers</i> was released, it was the band's second and final album to be certified platinum by the RIAA. His next album, <i>Haircut</i>, contained the song "Get a Haircut", which peaked at No. 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Album Rock Tracks, and was the No. 1 most played song on Canadian FM radio. In April 1995, EMI released the Destroyer's second live album, <i>Live: Let's Work Together</i>. After the release of the album the Destroyers embarked on a summer tour, after which they began preparing material for their next album. The Destroyers' next album was 1997's <i>Rockin' My Life Away</i>. It was their first studio album to miss the <i>Billboard</i> 200 since their debut in 1977, although it was their first to chart on <i>Billboard's</i> Top Blues Album chart.
</p><p>In 1998 EMI America dropped the Destroyers, so they signed with CMC International. The next year, they released <i>Half a Boy/Half a Man</i>. The album failed to chart in any capacity, and its single, "I Don't Trust Nobody", was their final single to chart, peaking at number 24 on the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Rock chart. CMC International also released their third live album, <i>Live in '99</i>. Their next albums all charted high on <i>Billboard's</i> Top Blues Album chart.
</p><p>George Thorogood signed a three-album deal with Eagle Records in 2002, and released <i>Ride 'Til I Die</i> the next year. <i>Ride 'Til I Die</i> was the final Destroyers album to feature Hank "Hurricane" Carter, he was replaced by Buddy Leach. In 2004, <i>Greatest Hits: 30 Years of Rock</i> was released, it was the band's final album to be certified gold by the RIAA. Eagle released their fourth live album, <i>30th Anniversary Tour: Live</i>, also in 2004, and <i>The Hard Stuff</i> in 2006.
</p><p>The Destroyers toured with Buddy Guy in the summer of 2008, before returning to EMI/Capitol in 2009 to release their next studio album, <i>The Dirty Dozen</i>. It was their first studio album since <i>Haircut</i> to reach the <i>Billboard</i> 200, peaking at number 169. In 2011 they released their most recent studio album, <i>2120 South Michigan Ave.</i>, which was a tribute to Chess Record artists. In 2012, Thorogood was named one of the "50 Most Influential Delawareans of the Past 50 Years". The next year the Destroyers celebrated their 40th year anniversary with a national tour. He released his first proper solo album in 2017, titled <i>Party of One,</i> which was his best selling album in a long time.
