Guitarist Wayne Swinny said, "a lot of our songs, whether they were intended that way or not - most of them weren't - they just lend themselves to sporting events.

<p>Saliva was founded in Bartlett, Tennessee in September 1996 by former members of local bands Roxy Blue, Blackbone and Gemini Clan. The original line-up featured vocalist Josey Scott Sappington, drummer Todd Poole, bassist Dave Novotny and guitarists Chris D'Abaldo and Wayne Swinny. The band played their first show on Halloween, October 31, 1996 with Sappington dressed as a nun and Novotny dressed in a voodoo costume.
</p><p>In December 1996, the band recorded a demo, on the basis of which they were selected to perform at the second annual Grammy Showcase National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences' local competition. The band barely had time to finish mixing at Rockingchair Recording Studios to submit their application before the deadline. The local showcase had Saliva perform alongside four other Tennessee and Arkansas bands (DDT Big Band, Mash-o-Matic, Straight Up Buzz and Ashtray Babyhead) on January 24, 1997 at Memphis' New Daisy Tavern. Saliva ranked first place at the local showcase and advanced to the regional showcase in Austin, Texas on February 7, 1997. Their demo was re-mixed with a better production, and the song "Suffocate" was included on the <i>1997 Grammy Showcase</i> Various Artists compact disc compilation, released through Grammy Recordings, with the eleven other bands they competed against in the regional showcases.
</p><p>Saliva won first place in the regional showcase and advanced to the national finals in New York City on February 22, 1997, competing against two other regional finalists: folk trio Maggi, Pierce, and EJ and rock band Save Ferris. Saliva came in second behind Save Ferris, but received consolation prizes including money, equipment and tickets to 1997's 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. By this point, Saliva had played six concerts, but major record label A&amp;R scouts began courting them.
</p><p>The band was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 12th Annual Premier Player Awards, the Memphis Grammy Awards, at The Peabody's Memphis Ballroom on April 16, 1997. Saliva appeared at Memphis' Crossroads '97 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May's Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 2, 1997.
</p><p>In the spring and summer of 1997, Saliva returned to Rockingchair Recording Studios in Memphis to record additional songs with producers Bill Pappas and Mark Yoshida, which were combined with the re-mixed songs from their demo tape into their self-titled debut album . <i>Saliva</i> was released on compact disc in mid-August 1997 through producer Yoshida's own independent record label Rockingchair Records. A CD-release party was held at Club 616 in Memphis on Friday, August 15, 1997. The album sold over 10,000 copies within two years, prompting Island Records A&amp;R representatives to notice the band. The band's debut album was repressed following Saliva's major label success through a licensing deal between Rockingchair Records and hip hop record label Diamond Productions. The reissue was distributed by RED Distribution imprint RUMM (RED Urban Music Marketing) and featured an updated artwork designed by Brandon Seavers at AudioGraphic MasterWorks.
</p><p>The band performed at Memphis' Crossroads '98 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May's Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 3, 1998. Poole departed in late 1999 and was replaced with Paul Crosby.

On May 29, 2005, guitarist Chris D'Abaldo announced he had left the band "for obvious reasons, as the band is not a unit anymore." He then shortly retracted his statement and apologized, declaring on the band's website that "there was a bit of an issue we're working through and we're looking forward to recording a new album later this year". However, the band's website later apologized again for the confusion and confirmed that due to "creative differences", D'Abaldo was in fact leaving the band, but that Saliva was "completely moving forward as planned and [has] our best music ahead of us". D'Abaldo eventually moved on to start the band Smolder. Jake Stutevoss formerly of the band Future Leaders of the World replaced him in Saliva's tour lineup. Stutevoss left the group right before the recording sessions for Ladies and Gentlemen. Jonathan Montoya, formerly of Full Devil Jacket, then became the next permanent member of Saliva.
