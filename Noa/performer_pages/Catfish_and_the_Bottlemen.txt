<p>Catfish and the Bottlemen, originally known as "The Prestige", were formed in May 2007, when Ryan Evan "Van" McCann and Billy Bibby began playing guitar together at Bibby's parents' bed and breakfast in Llandudno, Wales. McCann's parents also ran a bed and breakfast in Llandudno, and he first met Bibby through Bibby's younger brother, Stephen. The duo were soon joined by Benji Blakeway on bass, making him the third founding member of the band. Shortly afterwards, their schoolmate Jon Barr completed the line-up on drums. Bibby, who had been playing guitar since the age of 10, taught both McCann and Blakeway how to play.
</p><p>In an interview with Sound of Boston, McCann noted his dislike for playing covers because of the way his music career began: "When I was a 15 year old and we first started a band, our job Monday to Friday was to play at clubs, playing Beatles covers and Oasis covers. We spent seven years writing our own songs, making our own albums, and people are like 'play Kanye West!' We're like 'no man, are you crazy?<span>'</span>"
</p><p>The band initially promoted themselves by performing as support acts for friends' bands, including Northwich-based group The Shallow Call, and by playing impromptu gigs in car parks following shows by bigger bands, such as Kasabian. Steve Lamacq first played one of their early demos on BBC Radio 6 Music in March 2009. Later that year, Catfish and the Bottlemen competed in the 'North Wales Battle of the Bands', organised by Gareth Thomas, where they finished as runners-up to local band The Fides, who went on to perform at the Conwy River Festival.
</p><p>In 2010, original drummer Jon Barr was replaced by Bob Hall, who was introduced to the band by Russ Hayes, a North Wales-based producer working with the band at the time.
</p><p>McCann first met future band member Johnny Bond at the Ravenstonedale Festival in 2011, where both bands were performing. At the time, Bond was a member of Symphonic Pictures, but he would later join Catfish and the Bottlemen in 2014.
</p><p>The band's name originates from McCann's earliest musical memory: an Australian street busker he encountered in Sydney, known as Catfish the Bottleman. The busker earned the nickname "Catfish" due to his distinctive, spiky beard when he began performing in 2000, and he played beer bottles strung to a wire. In January 2015, McCann was reunited with Catfish the Bottleman at the Triple J studios in Sydney.

<p>In 2013, the band signed with Communion Music and released their first three singles, "Homesick", "Rango", and "Pacifier" the same year.
</p><p>In 2014, the band signed with Island Records and released the single "Kathleen" on 17 March, produced by Jim Abbiss (known for his work with Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian and Adele). All of their singles received premieres from Zane Lowe and were added to the BBC Radio 1 playlist. In April, "Kathleen" was ranked number one on MTV's hottest tracks.
</p><p>During the summer of 2014, Catfish and the Bottlemen performed at numerous festivals across the UK and Europe, including Reading and Leeds, Latitude, Kendal Calling, Y Not Festival, Strawberry Fields Festival, T in the Park, Pinkpop, Bingley Music Live and Ibiza Rocks. They also performed at New York's Governors Ball. On 19 June, the band announced their debut studio album, <i>The Balcony</i>, would be released in September.
</p><p>Later that summer, founding lead guitarist Billy Bibby unexpectedly ceased performing with the band and was replaced by Johnny "Bondy" Bond. On 25 July, the band cancelled three festival appearances, citing "unforeseen personal circumstances". Then, on 13 August, they announced on Facebook: "Some of you will have noticed that we have been playing with a different guitarist over the past weekend. Unfortunately, due to some personal circumstances, Billy won't be touring with the band for the foreseeable future."
</p><p>When asked about his departure, Bibby later reflected: "Well, to be honest, after Catfish I had no plans. I didn't know what I was going to do. I just started writing songs and it took off from there..." He added, "I'm proud of what I did in Catfish and what I achieved and everything that came with it, but I'm just looking into the future now with my band and that's all I'm focused on." In 2015, he went on to form his own band, Billy Bibby &amp; The Wry Smiles.
</p><p><i>The Balcony</i> was released on 15 September 2014, followed by the announcement of a UK tour. The album debuted at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 27 September and was certified Silver on 9 January 2015, Gold on 20 March and ultimately Platinum on 30 December 2016.

</p><p>At the 2016 Brit Awards, the band won the British Breakthrough Act category. In May, they headlined Liverpool Sound City, marking their first headline slot at a festival.
