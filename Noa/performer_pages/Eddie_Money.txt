<p>Edward Joseph Mahoney was born in Manhattan, New York City, on March 21, 1949, to a large family of Irish Catholic descent. His parents were Dorothy Elizabeth (<span title="Name at birth">née Keller</span>), a homemaker, and Daniel Patrick Mahoney, a police officer. He grew up in Levittown, New York, but spent some teenage years in Woodhaven, Queens, New York City. Money was a street singer from the age of eleven. As a teenager, he played in rock bands to get dates from cheerleaders. He was thrown out of one high school for forging a report card. In 1967, he graduated from Island Trees High School. 
</p><p>At the age of 18, he tried to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, father, and brother as a New York City Police Department trainee. However, after working as a clerk and typist, he left in 1968 to pursue a music career, as the police did not allow him to grow his hair long. "I couldn't see myself in a police uniform for 20 years of my life, with short hair," he later said. His bandmates also fired him because they did not want a police officer in the group. His father was unhappy with his decision to play music and tore Jimi Hendrix posters from his wall. He began studying the saxophone during a brief stint at junior college, inspired by rock musicians like David Bowie and Van Morrison who occasionally used the instrument.
</p><p>In 1968, Money moved to Berkeley, California. There, he studied with vocal coach Judy Davis and took on the stage name Eddie Money, dropping two letters from his last name and sarcastically referring to the fact that he was always broke.

</p><p>To mark the fifth anniversary of Money's death in September 2024, Money's wife, Laurie, released Money's final recording, "Stay with Me." "I knew that he'd talked about working on this song, but I didn't know that he'd completed his vocals on it, what the song was about, or even that it existed until nine months after he passed, when it was given to me by our friend who worked on it with him. Eddie never heard the finished song, but I know that he would've been very pleased with it and happy that it's finally being released," said Laurie.
