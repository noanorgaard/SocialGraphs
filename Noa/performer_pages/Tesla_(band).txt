<p><b>Tesla</b> is an American hard rock band from Sacramento, California. In late 1981, bassist Brian Wheat and guitarist Frank Hannon formed a band named City Kidd, which evolved into Tesla. By 1984, vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarist Tommy Skeoch, and drummer Troy Luccketta had joined the band, forming their classic lineup that appeared on all of the albums and live shows during their initial run. The band adopted the Tesla moniker shortly before recording their first album, as another band with a name similar to City Kidd already existed.
</p><p>Tesla rose to fame during the hair metal boom of the 1980s. Their debut album, <i>Mechanical Resonance</i>, was released in 1986, which produced two hit singles, "Modern Day Cowboy" and their cover of "Little Suzi" (originally by Ph.D.). The band's second album, <i>The Great Radio Controversy</i> (1989), peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 18 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart and produced the top-ten single "Love Song". The band recorded and released their third album, the live acoustic album <i>Five Man Acoustical Jam</i>, in 1990. It peaked at No. 12 on the <i>Billboard 200</i> and produced their top-charting single (No. 8 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100), "Signs", a cover of a song by the Five Man Electrical Band. Their third studio album, <i>Psychotic Supper</i> (1991), peaked at No. 13, but lacked a hit single; similarly their next album, 1994's <i>Bust a Nut</i> did well enough on the album charts, peaking at No. 20, but also lacked any radio hits. 
</p><p>The band broke up in 1996, but returned in 2000 with a live tour and album, both named <i>Replugged</i>. They have continued to record and tour, though Skeoch left in 2006 and was replaced by Dave Rude on guitars. Their most recent release is the EP <i>All About Love</i> (2024), while their latest studio album to date is <i>Shock</i> (2019). Tesla have sold at least 14 million albums in the United States.

<p>The band City Kidd was renamed Tesla during the recording of their first album, 1986's <i>Mechanical Resonance</i>, on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name (in addition, there was already another band going by that name). The band derived their name, certain album and song titles, and some song content from events relating to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Along with the band's next two studio albums, <i>Mechanical Resonance</i> was produced by Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson.
</p><p>The band's original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Robert Contreras, who was soon replaced by ex-Eric Martin Band drummer Troy Luccketta.
</p><p>In the early days of their career, Tesla toured with David Lee Roth, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, and Poison, which resulted in the band being categorized as a glam metal band. The band's members resented this labeling. The band, according to Troy Luccketta, now does not mind being labeled as a part of that scene.

<p>The band released their second album, <i>The Great Radio Controversy</i>, in 1989. The album helped solidify the band's growing reputation and fan base, and produced five hit singles, including the power ballad "Love Song".
</p><p>In 1990, Tesla released <i>Five Man Acoustical Jam</i>, a live album featuring acoustic renditions of hits such as "Comin' Atcha Live", "Gettin' Better", "Modern Day Cowboy", and "Love Song". The album also featured a number of covers, most notably a version of "Signs", a 1971 hit by the Five Man Electrical Band.
</p><p>In 1991, the band released their third studio album <i>Psychotic Supper</i>. The band itself considers this to be their best album according to their official web site. The 1998 Japanese reissue import of <i>Psychotic Supper</i> contains one previously unreleased song, "Rock the Nation", as well as the songs "I Ain't Superstitious", and "Run Run Run", both of which had only been previously available as B-sides to two singles from <i>The Great Radio Controversy</i>.

<p>In 1994, the band released their fourth studio album, <i>Bust a Nut</i>. The Japanese edition of <i>Bust a Nut</i> contained the previously unreleased cover of Led Zeppelin's "The Ocean".
</p><p>After the release of <i>Bust a Nut</i>, Skeoch departed because of his struggle with substance abuse. He rejoined after completing rehab, only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four-piece for a short while. However, it wasn't long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman's band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as Bar 7 with a single "Four Leaf Clover", from the album <i>The World Is a Freak</i>. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon formed Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area's One Thin Dime.

<p>After a break of six years, the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played a sold-out show at ARCO Arena in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album <i>Replugged Live</i>. In 2002 they were featured in the Rock Never Stops Tour alongside other 1980s rock bands.

</p><p>In the summer of 2006, the band embarked on the Electric Summer Jam Tour without guitarist Tommy Skeoch, who had left the band indefinitely to spend time with his family, and, as he later revealed on <i>The Classic Metal Show</i>, other reasons; particularly his continuing problems with substance abuse. Scott Johnson of the Sacramento band Rogue filled in for a time on this tour. Eventually Dave Rude replaced Skeoch permanently.
</p><p>Tesla recorded a two-volume collection of cover songs titled <i>Real to Reel</i>, which was released on June 5, 2007. The recording is available as a two-CD set. The first CD (containing 13 songs) is sold in a case with a blank slot for the second CD. The second CD (containing 12 additional songs) was initially available to concert goers in the US at no additional charge beyond the cost of a ticket. The second CD was also given away with the August edition of <i>Classic Rock</i> magazine in Europe.
</p><p>At the end of August, Tesla announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Charity_work">Charity work</h2>
<p>While promoting their album <i>The Great Radio Controversy</i>, the band participated in a canned food drive that allowed free concert admission to contributors, this event was incorporated into the video for "The Way It Is".
In February 2005, Tesla headlined a benefit show at the PPAC in Providence, Rhode Island, for the victims of the Station nightclub fire. During the show the band auctioned off an autographed acoustic guitar, with the proceeds going to the Station Family Fund. 100% of the ticket sales also went to this charity.
</p><p>In February 2008, Tesla helped fund and headlined a benefit concert for victims of the Station nightclub fire. The show was broadcast by VH1 Classic. Tesla played three songs: "What You Give", "Signs", and "Love Song", though "What You Give" did not make it onto the broadcast.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Most of Tesla's albums feature a bluesy hard rock style. Brian Wheat stated to have been influenced by classic 1960s and 1970s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Queen, Bad Company and the Beatles. Tesla's first two albums are often classified as glam metal, though AllMusic's Steve Huey opined that the band's blues and 1970s hard rock influences set them apart from their contemporaries. <i>Loudwire</i> described Tesla as a "thinking man's hair metal band", and VH1 ranked them at No. 22 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hair Metal.
