<p>Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds. They were a trio in spite of their name, and the primary motivation behind the name, apart from the band's well-known use of humor, was simple preference, according to Ben: "I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three." Folds once described their music as "punk rock for sissies," a reaction to the angst prevalent in '90s rock.
</p><p>Their first radio single was "Underground" from their self-titled debut album, released in 1995 on Caroline Records. The band's biggest success was the single "Brick" from their second album, <i>Whatever and Ever Amen,</i> released in 1997. It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album, <i>The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner</i>. The group contributed an outtake from the <i>Reinhold Messner</i> sessions, titled "Leather Jacket", to the 1999 benefit album, <i>No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees</i>.
</p><p>The band's final released recording was a cover of Steely Dan's "Barrytown" for the <i>Me, Myself &amp; Irene</i> soundtrack. The band had begun work on a fourth studio album, but following the worldwide tour in support of <i>The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner</i>, the band "amicably" broke up in October 2000.  Tracks from the sessions later emerged in solo projects.

<p>Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career, releasing his debut album <i>Rockin' the Suburbs</i> in 2001, followed by <i>Songs for Silverman</i> in 2005, <i>Way to Normal</i> in 2008, and <i>Lonely Avenue</i> in collaboration with novelist Nick Hornby in 2010. He produced and arranged actor William Shatner's second album <i>Has Been</i>, co-writing the majority of the songs with Shatner. Folds also contributed songs to the soundtracks for the animated movies <i>Hoodwinked!</i> and <i>Over the Hedge</i>, as well as forming the one-off side project The Bens (with Ben Lee and Ben Kweller) in 2003.
</p><p>Jessee formed the indie band Hotel Lights in 2004, with his songs featured in television and film. Jessee released three studio albums for Bar/None Records in this time – including <i>Hotel Lights</i> in 2006, <i>Firecracker People</i> in 2008, and <i>Girl Graffiti</i> in 2011.
</p><p>Sledge played with International Orange until the group disbanded in 2005. He later became the bass player in the three-piece Chapel Hill band Surrender Human, with Matt McMichaels from the Mayflies USA.

<p>Ben Folds Five made a one-off concert appearance in September 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill as part of the MySpace "Front to Back" series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its then-final album, <i>The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner</i>, and were briefly joined on stage by Ben's father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song "Your Most Valuable Possession", encoring with some of the songs from their first two albums.
</p><p>In 2011, Ben Folds Five reunited to record three tracks for Ben Folds' <i>The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective</i>. They made their first live appearance in four years as one of the headliners of the 2012 Mountain Jam festival. They made further appearances at that year's 2012 Bonnaroo and Summerfest festivals.
</p><p>The band's fourth studio album, <i>The Sound of the Life of the Mind</i> was released in September 2012, supported by the single <i>Do It Anyway</i>, with a video featuring Anna Kendrick, Rob Corddry, and the cast of <i>Fraggle Rock</i>. A tour of the US, the UK, Australia and Ireland followed across the remainder of 2012. 
</p><p>In June 2013, the trio released their first live album, titled <i>Live</i>. During that year Ben Folds Five toured with the Barenaked Ladies and Guster, before entering a hiatus that ultimately became permanent. Folds resumed his solo career, releasing the yMusic collaboration <i>So There</i> in 2015 and continuing to tour extensively. Jessee, meanwhile, released a new album with Hotel Lights in 2016, entitled <i>Get Your Hand in My Hand</i>, before releasing two solo albums: 2018's <i>The Jane, Room 217</i> and 2020's <i>Remover</i>.
</p><p>Caleb Southern – the producer of the band's first three albums and considered the "fourth member" of the band by Folds – died on July 6, 2023. The band briefly reunited for a concert in tribute to Southern on August 28, 2023, at the Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, performing five songs.
