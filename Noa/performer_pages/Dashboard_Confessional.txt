<p>Dashboard Confessional's first recording was the 2000 album <i>The Swiss Army Romance</i>, initially a solo side project of Chris Carrabba while he was in the band Further Seems Forever. The following year, Further Seems Forever, with Chris Carrabba, recorded its debut album, <i>The Moon Is Down</i>. Carrabba left the band before the album was released to record and release his second solo album, <i>The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most</i>, and a follow-up EP, <i>So Impossible</i>; both were released under the name Dashboard Confessional.
</p><p>By 2002, three other musicians had joined Dashboard Confessional. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on <i>MTV Unplugged</i>, and the subsequent live release marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band. Also in 2002, the music video for "Screaming Infidelities" won the MTV2 award at the MTV Video Music Awards, beating out Norah Jones, The Strokes, The Hives, Nappy Roots, and Musiq. This video starred Carrabba in both the performance and the storyline. The video was directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry.

<p>In 2003, Dashboard Confessional released its third album, <i>A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar</i>. Peaking at No. 2 on the United States <i>Billboard</i> charts, the album proved to be the band's most commercially viable album yet. In the fall of 2003, Dashboard Confessional toured with Brand New.
</p><p>In the summer of 2004, Dashboard Confessional recorded the song "Vindicated" for the film <i>Spider-Man 2</i>. It was featured on the soundtrack and played over the film's end credits. Due to such usage, the band gained a sizable audience for their next release the following summer, <i>Dusk and Summer</i>. "Vindicated" was not, however, released on <i>A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar</i> but was included on most versions and deluxe edition versions of <i>Dusk and Summer</i>.

<p><b>John C. Lefler</b> (born March 18, 1975) is an American songwriter, singer, guitarist, and pianist. He is a former member of Dashboard Confessional. Lefler has a been an freelance graphic designer since 2012.
</p><p>Lefler is from Sugar Land, Texas. He attended Dulles High School and graduated high school in 1993. He attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 1997 with a degree in fine art. Lefler started playing guitar in 1989 and piano shortly thereafter. His first instrument was a PVT-60 which his father had purchased from a pawn shop. He started writing songs when he was about 18 years old, after seeing the John Lennon bio-pic, <i>Imagine</i>. Lefler had piano lessons for a few months while in high school. "My recital piece was Bruce Hornsby's "The Way It Is". It was terrible. I've never had another lesson (or recital) of any kind since." When describing his piano technique, he stated, "I tend to play the piano with my fists more than anything."
</p><p>Lefler joined Dashboard Confessional in 2002 after having flown out to meet the rest of the band in Florida. In less than two weeks, Lefler made his first official appearance as a Dashboard Confessional member on the <i>MTV Unplugged</i> recording. He left on his own accord after the band's hiatus began in 2010.
</p><p>In 2005, Lefler and his brothers Bill and Kevin formed an alternative-country band called The Wimbledons in Los Angeles, California. After much infighting between the brothers, the band completed <i>The Wimbledons EP</i> on Lefler's own label, Goodhang Records. Being influenced by bands like Jellyfish, Ben Folds, Crowded House, The Police, The Beatles, and U2, Lefler released <i>Better By Design</i> in June 2009. <i>Better By Design</i> was co-produced by Lefler, along with friends Salim Nourallah and Rip Rowan.
