Nickelback released eight singles from their sixth album <i>Dark Horse</i> (2008), including the United States top-10 track "Gotta Be Somebody". In 2011, the seventh album <i>Here and Now</i> topped the charts in Canada.

<p>The band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called Village Idiot
by brothers Mike and Chad Kroeger; their cousin Brandon Kroeger and Ryan Peake rounded out the band. The band later changed its name to Nickelback, which originated from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his job at Starbucks; he would frequently say, "Here's your nickel back."
The band performed covers of songs from Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Chad Kroeger then asked his step-father to loan him CA$4,000 so that the band could record their first demo, a seven-track EP of original material, called <i>Hesher</i> (1996).
The band spent half the money to record the EP, while Kroeger spent the other half on magic mushrooms to resell.

<p>In 1996, the band recorded and released their first full-length album, <i>Curb</i>. "Fly" was included on both <i>Hesher</i> and <i>Curb</i> and was the first single produced by Nickelback. In 1997, Brandon Kroeger left the band and was replaced by Mitch Guindon; however, Guindon soon departed as well. While initially reported due to him starting work at a car company, Guindon's departure came due to him "not [being] meant for the road". Chad Kroeger stated that his skin was not able to handle cold weather and they convinced him to leave. In Summer 1998, Ryan Vikedal joined the band.
</p><p>Roadrunner A&amp;R Ron Burman told HitQuarters that one of his West Coast scouts sent him the self-released album and, suitably impressed, he travelled to Vancouver to see them perform live. Although an unknown property in the industry at the time, the venue was packed out. In Burman's words: "I immediately got the chills! I thought their song 'Leader of Men' was a smash hit." Off the stage he was impressed by their industry and initiative in managing their career. Despite this, it still took Burman three months for him to convince his label bosses to approve the signing, a decision that would mark Roadrunner's first move into mainstream rock. Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and Roadrunner Records in 1999.
</p><p><i>The State</i> was released by Nickelback in 2000 by Roadrunner Records and EMI Canada, followed by its release in Europe in 2001. It spawned 4 singles: "Old Enough", "Worthy to Say", "Leader of Men" and "Breathe", the last two being Top 10 rock hits. The album was the band's first album to be certified gold status and it later went into platinum status in 2008, after the success of their later albums. The album entered the <i>Billboard</i> 200 at number 130 and peaked at number 3 in the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart.

<p>Around 2001, Chad Kroeger started "studying every piece, everything sonically, everything lyrically, everything musically, chord structure. I would dissect every single song that I would hear on the radio or every song that had ever done well on a chart and I would say, 'Why did this do well?'" Kroeger said that Nickelback's single "How You Remind Me" sold so well because it was about romantic relationships, a universal subject, and contained memorable hooks.
</p>

<p>To record their third album <i>Silver Side Up</i>, Nickelback collaborated with producer Rick Parashar. The album was written before the release of <i>The State</i> and was recorded at the same studio. The album was released on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The album peaked at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with over 177,000 copies sold in its first week and peaked at number one at the Canadian albums chart, making it the band's first album to do so. The single "How You Remind Me" was a number one single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart. It also peaked at number two on Adult Top 40 and became the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number one single of the year for 2002. The next single was "Too Bad", which also reached number one on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The final single from the album was "Never Again", which also hit number one on Mainstream Rock.
</p><p>In 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated with Josey Scott on the <i>Spider-Man</i> theme song, "Hero". This recording also featured Tyler Connolly, Mike Kroeger, Matt Cameron, and Jeremy Taggart. In 2002, Nickelback released their first DVD <i>Live at Home</i>. On August 19, 2002, an incident occurred while the band was performing at the Ilha do Ermal festival in Portugal. While performing the second song of their set, Chad Kroeger was sprayed with a full bottle of water hurled from somewhere within the audience. After finishing the song, Chad asked the crowd, "Do you want to hear some rock 'n' roll or do you want to go home?" A person in the audience then threw a rock at Chad's head. The band then left stage, with Chad and Vikedal giving the finger to the audience as they left. The band's label, Roadrunner, posted video footage of the entire incident on their website.
</p><p>In 2003, Nickelback released <i>The Long Road</i>. The album was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA in March 2005 and it had sold 3,591,000 copies as of April 2011. It has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and, in 2003 alone, the album sold 2 million copies worldwide. It debuted at No. 6 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. This was their first album produced by Joey Moi, a former classmate of the band's.
</p><p><i>The Long Road</i> was ranked No. 157 on <i>Billboard'</i>s <i>200 Albums of the Decade</i>. It spawned five singles. The lead single was "Someday". The band also released "Feelin' Way Too Damn Good" as a single, which peaked at number three on the Mainstream Rock Charts. "Figured You Out" was also released as a single and topped the Mainstream Rock Charts for 13 consecutive weeks.

<p>After wrapping up the band's tour in support of <i>The Long Road</i> on New Year's Day 2005, drummer Ryan Vikedal was fired after a royalty dispute. He was later replaced by 3 Doors Down's drummer Daniel Adair. Kroeger later sued Vikedal to prevent him receiving any further royalties from Nickelback's music, though the lawsuit was later settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Nickelback promptly went into the studio with their new drummer from January through May 2005. The sessions resulted in their fifth studio album, <i>All the Right Reasons</i> which was released on October 3, 2005. It peaked at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 323,350 copies in its first week in the United States, as well as producing five U.S. Hot 100 top 20 singles: "Photograph", "Savin' Me", "Far Away", "If Everyone Cared" and "Rockstar". Three of these became U.S. Hot 100 top 10 singles. Also, the album peaked at number one on the Canadian albums chart. The album sold more than 12 million singles and over 9 million ringtones. The album also made Nickelback the first band in Nielsen BDS history to have 5 singles on the CHR charts.  It included appearances by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, who played a guitar solo on the song "Follow You Home" and sang backing vocals on "Rockstar"—and a posthumously sampled appearance by Chad Kroeger's friend Dimebag Darrell from Pantera, culled from guitar outtakes. <i>All the Right Reasons</i> had sold over 7 million copies in the U.S. to June 19, 2010.
</p>

<p>The band spent much of 2006 and 2007 touring across the globe. In the fall of 2006, the band opened for Bon Jovi on the European leg of the Have a Nice Day Tour. Over 2 million fans attended Nickelback's shows during those two years.
</p><p>The band played at Sturgis, South Dakota to over 35,000 people at the 2006 Sturgis Bike Rally. The performance was filmed with 15 high-definition cameras. They released the DVD and Blu-ray of it in 2009, several years after the performance. In November 2006, the band won an American Music Award for best pop/rock album, surprising the band itself. "We just kinda showed up because we were supposed to give one of these away tonight," Chad Kroeger said after receiving the award. He added that he had thought the Red Hot Chili Peppers would win the award.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Dark_Horse_(2008–2010)" data-mw-fallback-anchor="Dark_Horse_.282008.E2.80.932010.29"><i>Dark Horse</i> (2008–2010)</h3>
<p>After taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in earnest. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth. On September 4, 2008, it was announced that the first single from the upcoming album would be "If Today Was Your Last Day", to be released on September 30, 2008. This announcement was however never confirmed: Roadrunner Records actually chose to release another song, "Gotta Be Somebody", as the first single. It became Nickelback's 5th and so far final single to hit the No. 1 spot on the U.S. Adult Top 40 chart. The new album, produced by Mutt Lange and titled <i>Dark Horse</i>, was released on November 18, 2008. "Something in Your Mouth" was released as the second single to rock radio only on December 15, 2008, where it reached number one. "If Today Was Your Last Day" was eventually released as a single after all on March 31, 2009: it became the third single from the album. Four more singles were released later in 2009, "I'd Come for You", "Burn It to the Ground" and "Never Gonna Be Alone" released in September and "Shakin' Hands" as the seventh single on November 16. Its eighth single, "This Afternoon", was released on March 23, 2010. <i>Dark Horse</i> was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 9, 2008, only three weeks after its North American release.  All eight singles were major hits which finished at or near the top of at least one high-profile chart.
</p><p>On November 26, 2008, the band announced the tour for the support of the album. Live Nation produced the tour and the band kicked off in Nashville, Tennessee, with Seether, and Saving Abel as their opening acts. The band then announced that they were about to tour in the UK with Black Stone Cherry as their opening act. The band then announced the second leg of the tour of North America with the opening acts being Hinder, Papa Roach, and once again, Saving Abel. The band then went on tour around Australia and New Zealand with Sick Puppies as their supporting act. For the second leg of the Europe tour, the band played with their opening act Daughtry. The third leg of the North America tour kicked off with Breaking Benjamin, Sick Puppies and Shinedown opening up for the band. The band concluded their tour with the fourth leg in North America which included Buckcherry and Three Days Grace. The tour was very successful and the band sold over 1.6 million tickets with 146 shows.
</p>

<p>The album also remained in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 for weeks after its release. The album was certified two times platinum in April 2009, and had by April 2010 sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. However, critical reception of the album has been mostly mixed to negative. In 2009, the band won three Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, group of the year, and album of the year; the band performed their single "Something in Your Mouth" at the ceremony. In 2010, Billboard year end charts listed <i>Dark Horse</i> as the top-selling rock and metal album of the year. The band was also listed at the top selling hard rock artist.

<p>In early 2019, band members spoke of recording a tenth studio album, though Chad Kroeger conceded there was no timetable or rush for the band to complete it. Bassist Mike Kroeger spoke of his personal desire to move in more of a heavy metal direction, or wanting to do an album of Slayer cover songs.

</p><p>In a July 2021 interview Mike Kroeger commented when asked about the band's progress on new music saying "That is happening right now, music is being composed and recorded up in Canada. We were out there, and something came up and our producer had to take some time off. So I took that opportunity to return home to Los Angeles with family and spend a little time at home but I'll be headed back up there in a couple of weeks to pick it up again." When asked about a potential timeframe for a release date, Kroeger said "it'll be done when it's done", explaining that the band would rather not be confined to a timescale for fear of making "a shitty record". "Release dates are primarily arrived at by business interests, like record labels and whatever. We don't have one of those", he said. "We've been managing ourselves for about a year. So, the answer is no. We're doing it on our schedule, at our own pace, and it'll be done when it's done. 'Cause we've blown up deadlines in the past lots of times. Because we feel that you can make a good record and be late, but you can't, or you shouldn't, make a shitty record to be on time. So we won't be pressed for time.
</p><p>In August 2022, Nickelback began posting small snippets and teasers of new music via their official social media accounts with the date "09.07.2022" being branded on the posts.
</p><p>On August 26, 2022, students attending school at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia received a newsletter stating they were invited to attend and participate in a video shoot Nickelback would be hosting on August 30, 2022, for their single, outside the Convocation Mall on campus.
</p><p>The album title was revealed to be <i>Get Rollin'</i>. The lead single "San Quentin" was released on September 7, 2022.

</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Nickelback has been described as various genres, including post-grunge, hard rock, pop rock, alternative rock, alternative metal, nu metal, heavy metal, and grunge.
</p><p>Nickelback have cited bands and musicians such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Marley, Metallica, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ozzy Osbourne
and U2 as influential or inspirational.
</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Reception_and_legacy">Reception and legacy</h2>

<p>Nickelback has been subjected to numerous jokes and a vocal negative response for some audiences, some of which is attributed to the perceived derivative, repetitive and formulaic nature of their music, as well as their over-use of hedonistic themes involving strippers, sex, prostitutes, drugs, and alcohol consumption. In the 2010s, Nickelback became the subject of internet memes that criticized their music, a status that the band came to embrace. Several sources, including CBC News and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, named Nickelback the "most hated" band of the internet world. <i>Stereogum</i>'s Tom Breihan described Nickelback as "the most widely disrespected rock band of the 21st century." In May 2013, the readers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine named Nickelback the second-worst band of the 1990s, behind only Creed. In November 2011, users of the music-oriented dating site Tastebuds.fm voted Nickelback as the number one "musical turnoff". However, Chad Kroeger commented in a 2014 interview that the criticism helped him "grow a thick skin", and that without it, they would be "this just whatever band".
</p><p>Some have criticized the band's lyrics as misogynistic. Christopher Rosa of <i>VH1</i> said in 2015: "Not only are they bad, but they sound like they came straight from a horny 18-year-old boy's mind. Seriously, where's the sophistication? Where's the class? All that we have here is misogyny—gross, tone-deaf misogyny that is particularly cringe-worthy in 2015."  However, in a review for the band's ninth album <i>Feed the Machine</i>, AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that they had mostly done away with the crude and vulgar lyrical content they had become known for, and praised the band for evolving their sound. In 2015, a marketing expert surveyed 225 popular songs and found that Nickelback had the "most sophisticated" lyrics among the rock music artists included in the study.
</p>

<p>Various musicians, such as Chris Martin, Timbaland, and Keyshia Cole, have publicly shown support for the band. Following their 2008 album <i>Dark Horse</i>, <i>Chart Attack</i> credited the band's success to knowing their target audience: "Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want and precisely how far he can go. He turned out an extremely racy album that's loaded with songs about gettin' drunk and doin' it all without breaking any taboos, and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the mainstream. Rejoice, North America. This is your world." <i>Billboard</i> praised the band in a review of <i>Dark Horse</i> by saying: "The bulletproof Nickelback provides affordable fun that promises good returns in hard times."
</p><p>Journalist Sage Lazzaro claimed that Nickelback's negative reputation began when the band signed to Roadrunner Records and was disliked by the label's followers, which at the time was known for heavy metal music. She also wrote that a frequently-aired 2003 commercial for Comedy Central's <i>Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn</i> contributed to this spreading when it insulted Nickelback and the commercial gained mass exposure. In 2014, Angelica Leicht of <i>Houston Press</i> conferred the title of "the reigning butt-rock band always and forever" on Nickelback. During 2018, the band was defended in a teaser trailer for the film <i>Once Upon a Deadpool</i> by the title character. In response, Nickelback released a video in 2024 defending the sequel <i>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</i> from criticism. The band is profiled in <i>Hate to Love: Nickelback</i>, a 2023 documentary film by Leigh Brooks which focuses on the band's reputation.
