<p>Chapman made her major-stage debut as an opening act for women's music pioneer Linda Tillery at Boston's Strand Theatre on May 3, 1985. Another Tufts student, Brian Koppelman, heard her playing and brought her to the attention of his father, Charles Koppelman, showing him a demo tape he had smuggled from her college radio station containing the song "Talkin' 'bout a Revolution". Charles Koppelman, who ran SBK Publishing, signed her in 1986. After she graduated from Tufts in 1987, he helped her to sign a contract with Elektra Records.
</p>

<p>At Elektra, she released <i>Tracy Chapman</i> (1988). The album was critically acclaimed, and she began touring and building a fanbase. "Fast Car" began its rise on the U.S. charts soon after she performed it at the televised Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in London in June 1988. At the concert, she initially performed a short set in the afternoon, but reached a larger audience when she was a last-minute stand in for Stevie Wonder, who had technical difficulties. This appearance is credited with greatly accelerating sales of the single and album. "Fast Car" became a No. 6 pop hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 for the week ending August 27, 1988. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the song at number 167 on their 2010 list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". "Talkin' 'bout a Revolution", the follow-up to "Fast Car", charted at No. 75 and was followed by "Baby Can I Hold You", which peaked at No. 48. The album sold well, going multi-platinum and winning three Grammy Awards, including an honor for her as Best New Artist. Later in 1988 she was a featured performer on the worldwide Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour.
</p><p>Her follow-up album, <i>Crossroads</i> (1989), was less commercially successful than her debut had been, but it still achieved platinum status in the U.S. In 1992, she released <i>Matters of the Heart</i>. Her fourth album, <i>New Beginning</i> (1995), proved successful, selling over five million copies in the U.S. alone. The album included the hit single "Give Me One Reason", which won the 1997 Grammy for Best Rock Song and became her most successful single in the U.S. to date, peaking at No. 3 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and going Platinum. Her fifth album, <i>Telling Stories</i>, was released in 2000, and later went gold. She released her sixth album, <i>Let It Rain</i>, in 2002.
</p><p>She was commissioned by the American Conservatory Theater to compose music for its production of Athol Fugard's <i>Blood Knot</i>, a play about apartheid in South Africa, staged in early 2008. Atlantic Records released her eighth studio album, <i>Our Bright Future</i> (2008). The album earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album the following year.
</p>

<p>She was appointed a member of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival U.S. Documentary jury. She performed Ben E. King's "Stand By Me" on one of the final episodes of the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i> in April 2015.

</p>

<p>On November 20, 2015, she released <i>Greatest Hits</i>, consisting of 18 tracks including the live version of "Stand by Me". The album is her first global compilation release.
</p><p>In October 2018, she sued the rapper Nicki Minaj over copyright infringement, alleging that Minaj had sampled her song "Baby Can I Hold You" without permission. Chapman stated that she had "repeatedly denied" permission for "Baby Can I Hold You" to be sampled. The lawsuit alleged that Minaj had engaged in copyright infringement (a) by creating the song "Sorry" and (b) by distributing it; she requested an injunction to prevent Minaj from releasing the song. According to the lawsuit, Chapman has a policy of declining all requests for permission to sample her songs. In September 2020, District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips granted summary judgment in favor of Minaj on the first count of her complaint, stating that Minaj's experimentation with Chapman's song constituted fair use rather than copyright infringement. However, the judge ruled that the second count of the complaint should go to trial. In January 2021, the dispute was settled when Minaj paid Chapman $450,000.
</p><p>On the eve of the 2020 United States presidential election she performed "Talkin' 'bout a Revolution" on <i>Late Night with Seth Meyers</i>, encouraging people to vote.
</p><p>When Luke Combs' version of her song "Fast Car" hit number one on the Country Airplay chart in July 2023, Chapman became the first Black woman to score a country number one with a solo composition. At the 57th Annual Country Music Association Awards in November 2023, she became the first Black woman to ever take home a CMA Award, winning Song of the Year for "Fast Car", which also made her the first Black songwriter to win that award. During the 66th Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, she joined Combs onstage to sing "Fast Car".

Whether that is about raising money or helping to raise awareness, just being another body to show some force and conviction for a particular idea. Finding out where the need is – and if someone thinks you're going to be helpful, then helping.</p></blockquote>
