<p><b>Alanis Nadine Morissette</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling">ə-<span>LAN</span>-iss <span>MORR</span>-iss-<span>ET</span></i>; born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian and American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress. Regarded as the "queen of alt-rock angst", she became a cultural phenomenon for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting. She has sold more than 60 million records worldwide. Her accolades include a Brit Award, seven Grammy Awards, fourteen Juno Awards, and nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and a Tony Award.
</p><p>Morissette began her music career in Canada in the early 1990s with two dance-pop albums, <i>Alanis</i> (1991) and <i>Now Is the Time</i> (1992). After relocating to Los Angeles, she released the alternative rock album <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> (1995), which became one of the best-selling albums of all time and has appeared on several all-time lists. She won five Grammy Awards for the record including Album of the Year, becoming the youngest winner of the category at the time. She continued this success with her next album <i>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</i> (1998), which saw her adapt an experimental sound and was highly anticipated. That same year, her single "Uninvited" for <i>City of Angels</i> won two Grammy Awards and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Original Song.
</p><p>Beginning in 2002, Morissette took on further creative control and production duties as the sole producer of her fifth album, <i>Under Rug Swept</i>, which won her the Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award. Her 2005 song "Wunderkind" for <i>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> netted her a second nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Original Song. She has continued her career with the albums <i>So-Called Chaos</i> (2004), <i>Flavors of Entanglement</i> (2008), <i>Havoc and Bright Lights</i> (2012), <i>Such Pretty Forks in the Road</i> (2020), and <i>The Storm Before the Calm</i> (2022).
</p><p>Morissette holds the record for the most number ones on the weekly <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart among female soloists, group leaders, or duo members. Her first three internationally released studio albums topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart, and her next four albums peaked within the top 20. Her singles "You Oughta Know", "Hand in My Pocket", "Ironic", "You Learn", "Head Over Feet", "Uninvited", "Thank U", and "Hands Clean", reached top 40 in major charts around the world. VH1 ranked her the 53rd-greatest woman in rock and roll. In 2005, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Early_life_and_education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Morissette was born on June 1, 1974, at Riverside Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Georgia Mary Ann (<span title="Name at birth">née</span> Feuerstein) and Alan Richard Morissette. Her elder brother, Chad (born 1971), is an entrepreneur, and her twin brother, Wade (12 minutes elder), is a musician. Alan is of French and Irish descent, while Georgia, who fled Hungary during the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, has Jewish ancestry. Morissette has described her ethnicity as "a quarter Jewish". On a 2024 episode of <i>Finding Your Roots</i>, she stated that Alan and Georgia had never told their children about the family's Jewish ancestry, which she did not discover until her late 20s.
</p><p>In 1977, the family moved to Lahr, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany, and Alan and Georgia started working as teachers at the local base of Canadian Air Command. They returned to Ottawa in 1980, and Morissette started taking dance lessons the next year. She had a Catholic upbringing. Morissette attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school and Immaculata High School for seventh and eighth grades; she appeared on five episodes of the children's television sketch comedy series <i>You Can't Do That on Television</i> (1986) while attending the former. She then attended and graduated from Glebe Collegiate Institute.

<p>Morissette is known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting. She recorded her first demo called "Fate Stay with Me", produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, and engineered by Rich Dodson of Canadian classic rock band The Stampeders. A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to Geffen Records, but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label's headquarters in October 1989.
</p><p>In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette's debut album, <i>Alanis</i>, in Canada only. She co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum, and its first single, "Too Hot", reached the top 20 on the <i>RPM</i> singles chart. Subsequent singles "Walk Away" and "Feel Your Love" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada; comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice. She was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won), Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for "Too Hot").
</p><p>In 1992, Morrisette released her second album, <i>Now Is the Time</i>, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than <i>Alanis</i> and contained more thoughtful lyrics. She wrote the songs with its producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She said of the album, "People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one." As with <i>Alanis</i>, <i>Now Is the Time</i> was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"An Emotion Away", the minor adult contemporary hit "No Apologies" as well as "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". The industry considered it a commercial failure since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.

<p>In 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to the manager Scott Welch. Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her "spectacular" voice, her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people. After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto. Her publisher funded part of her development and she spent her time there composing and rehearsing with a number of other musicians, looking to find a songwriting partner for her next album.  Although a number of songs came out of these sessions, none would make an album cut and no lasting partnerships were formed.
</p><p>After Morissette moved to Los Angeles, she met the producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio. They wrote songs together, with him supporting her sound rather than trying to shape or mold it to his own tastes. In her newfound freeness of creative spirit, they wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, and in 1995 she signed a deal with Maverick Records. According to Welch, every other label they approached declined to sign her.
</p>

<p>Maverick Records released <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> internationally in June 1995. It was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing "You Oughta Know", the first single, featuring Flea and Dave Navarro from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics, and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic. In a 2008 interview, Dave Coulier said he was the ex-boyfriend who inspired "You Oughta Know"; in the 2021 documentary <i>Jagged</i>, Morissette denied it is about him. In a 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Morissette mentioned that multiple people have taken credit for being the inspiration behind her song "You Oughta Know". She stated, "I just think: If you're going to take credit for a song where I'm singing about someone being a douche or an asshole, you might not want to say, 'Hey! That's me!'" She described the song as being written out of "devastation", reflecting a range of emotions that women often feel but are told to suppress, such as anger and sadness.
</p><p>After the success of "You Oughta Know", the album's other hits helped send <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> to the top of the charts. "All I Really Want" and "Hand in My Pocket" followed, and the fourth U.S. single, "Ironic", became Morissette's biggest hit. "You Learn" and "Head over Feet", the fifth and sixth singles, kept <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> (1995) in the top 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart for more than a year. <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> sold more than 16 million copies in the U.S.; it sold 33 million worldwide, making it the second biggest-selling album by a female artist (behind Shania Twain's <i>Come On Over</i>).
</p><p>Morissette's popularity grew significantly in Canada, where the album was certified twelve times platinum and produced four <i>RPM</i> chart-toppers: "Hand in My Pocket", "Ironic", "You Learn", and "Head over Feet". The album was also a bestseller in Australia and the United Kingdom.
</p><p>Morissette's success with <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> (1995) was credited with opening doors for female singers such as Meredith Brooks, Tracy Bonham and Patti Rothberg, and later Avril Lavigne and Pink. Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year ("You Oughta Know"), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album. At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996, she won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for "You Oughta Know"), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.
</p><p>"Ironic" got the instant success, though the lyrics were heavily criticized for their malapropism, and the music video received 6 nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, where it won Best New Artist in a Video, Best Female Video and Best Editing in a Video (won by Scott Gray, Editor), and was also nominated for Viewer's Choice, Best Direction in a Video and Video of the Year. Rather than perform that song at the ceremony, Morrisette performed "Your House" instead, which is homage to Joni Mitchell. The song was also nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form—and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where she also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award.
</p><p>Morissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour's drummer. Radiohead joined as the opening act in mid-1996. The video <i>Jagged Little Pill, Live</i>, which was co-directed by Morissette and is about the bulk of her tour won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.
</p><p>Following the tour, Morissette began practicing Iyengar Yoga for balance. After the last December 1996 show, she went to India for six weeks, accompanied by Georgia, two aunts and two friends. The trip left her with an indelible impression and set the cornerstone for the concept of her next album.
</p>

<p>Morissette was featured as a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr's cover of "Drift Away" on his 1998 album, <i>Vertical Man</i>, and on the songs "Don't Drink the Water" and "Spoon" on the Dave Matthews Band album <i>Before These Crowded Streets</i>. She recorded the song "Uninvited" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film <i>City of Angels</i>. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.
</p><p>In November 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, <i>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</i>, which she wrote and co-produced with Glen Ballard. The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release; instead, it debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies—a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist. The wordy, personal lyrics on <i>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</i> alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx. It received positive reviews, including a four-star review from <i>Rolling Stone</i>. In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum. "Thank U", the album's only major international hit single, was released in October 1998 and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy. She directed the videos for "Unsent" and "So Pure", which won, respectively, the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Director and the Juno Award for Video of the Year.
</p><p>Morissette contributed vocals to four tracks on Jonathan Elias's project <i>The Prayer Cycle</i>, which was released in 1999, where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian on "Mercy" and "Faith", and in French on "Hope" and "Innocence". The same year, she released the live acoustic album <i>Alanis Unplugged</i>, which was recorded during her appearance on the television show <i>MTV Unplugged</i>. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including "King of Pain" (a cover of The Police song) and "No Pressure over Cappuccino", which she wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the <i>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</i> track "That I Would Be Good", released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song "Are You Still Mad" on the charity album <i>Live in the X Lounge II</i>. For her live rendition of "So Pure" at Woodstock '99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards. During the summer of 1999, Morissette toured with singer-songwriter Tori Amos on the <i>5 and a Half Weeks Tour</i> in support of Amos' album <i>To Venus and Back</i> (1999).

<p>In 2001, Morissette was featured with Stephanie McKay on the Tricky song "Excess", which is on his album <i>Blowback</i>. She released her fifth studio album, <i>Under Rug Swept</i>, in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from Eric Avery, Dean DeLeo, Flea, and Meshell Ndegeocello.
</p><p><i>Under Rug Swept</i> debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S. It produced the hit single "Hands Clean", which topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received substantial radio play; for her work on "Hands Clean" and "So Unsexy", Morissette won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year. A second single, "Precious Illusions", was released, but it did not garner significant success outside Canada or U.S. hot AC radio.
</p><p>Later in 2002, Morissette released the combination package <i>Feast on Scraps</i>, which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the <i>Under Rug Swept</i> recording sessions. Preceded by the single "Simple Together", it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year.
</p>

<p>Morissette hosted the Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson's breast-flash incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. She released her sixth studio album, <i>So-Called Chaos</i>, in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S. and was her first album not to top the chart. The lead single, "Everything", achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word "asshole", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word "nightmare" instead. Unhappy that U.S. radio networks had required her to change a word in the song, Canadian radio played the unaltered version, with her stating at the 2004 Juno Awards in Canada: "Well, I am overjoyed to be back in my homeland, the true North, strong and censor-free." Two other singles, "Out Is Through" and "Eight Easy Steps", fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of "Eight Easy Steps" was a U.S. club hit. Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies, working with the non-profit environmental organization Reverb.
</p><p>To commemorate the 10th anniversary of <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> (1995), Morissette released a studio acoustic version, <i>Jagged Little Pill Acoustic</i>, in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through Starbucks' Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale. As of November 2010, <i>Jagged Little Pill Acoustic</i> had sold 372,000 copies in the U.S., and a video for "Hand in My Pocket" received rotation on VH1 in America. The accompanying tour ran for two months in mid-2005, with Morissette playing small theatre venues. During the same period, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. She opened for The Rolling Stones for a few dates of their A Bigger Bang Tour in fall 2005.
</p><p>Morissette released the greatest hits album <i>Alanis Morissette: The Collection</i> in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of Seal's "Crazy", was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of <i>The Collection</i> features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: "King of Intimidation" and "Can't Not". (A reworked version of "Can't Not" had also appeared on <i>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie</i>.) It also includes a ninety-second clip of the unreleased video for the single "Joining You". As of November 2010, <i>The Collection</i> had sold 373,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. That same year, Morissette contributed the song "Wunderkind" to the soundtrack of the film <i>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.
</p><p>2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i> in January when she performed "Wunderkind".
</p><p>On April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who act as if attempting to touch her breasts, had received 16,465,653 views as of February 15, 2009. She did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy "Fergie" Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her following album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like "My Humps" and the joke just took a life of its own.
</p><p>Morissette performed at a gig for The Nightwatchman, a.k.a. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles in April 2007. The following June, she performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "O Canada", the American and Canadian national anthems, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Ottawa Senators and Anaheim Ducks in Ottawa. (The NHL requires arenas to perform both the American and Canadian national anthems at games involving teams from both countries.)

<p>In early 2008, Morissette participated in a tour with Matchbox Twenty and Mutemath as a special guest. Her seventh studio album, <i>Flavors of Entanglement</i>, which was produced by Guy Sigsworth, was released in mid-2008. She has said that the album was created out of her grief after her breakup with Ryan Reynolds, saying "it was cathartic." She stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album's first single was "Underneath", a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth. On October 3, 2008, she released the video for her latest single, "Not as We". She said the album was created out of her grief after splitting up with Reynolds, and the song "Torch" was written about him.
She has also recorded a cover of the 1984 Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias hit, "To All the Girls I've Loved Before", re-written as "To All the Boys I've Loved Before". Nelson played rhythm guitar on the recording. In April 2010, she released the song "I Remain", which she wrote for the <i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i> soundtrack. On May 26, 2010, the season finale of <i>American Idol</i>, she performed a duet of "You Oughta Know" with Runner Up Crystal Bowersox. She left Maverick Records after all promotion for <i>Flavors</i> was completed.
</p>

<p>On November 20, 2011, she appeared at the American Music Awards. When asked about the new album during a short interview, she said she had recorded 31 songs, and that the album would "likely be out next year, probably [in] summertime". On December 21, 2011, she performed a duet of "Uninvited" with finalist Josh Krajcik during the performance finale of the X-Factor.
</p><p>Morissette embarked on a European tour for summer 2012, according to Alanis.com. In early May 2012, a new song called "Magical Child" appeared on a Starbucks compilation called Every Mother Counts.
</p><p>On May 2, 2012, Morissette revealed through her Facebook account that her eighth studio album, entitled <i>Havoc and Bright Lights</i>, would be released in August 2012, on new label Collective Sounds, distributed by Sony's RED Distribution. On the same day, <i>Billboard</i> specified the date as August 28 and revealed the album would contain twelve tracks. Its lead single, "Guardian", was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012, and hit the radio airwaves four days prior to this. The single had minor success in North America, charting the <i>Billboard</i> Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in the US and almost reaching the top 40 in Canada. It was a hit in several European countries.
</p>

<p>On August 21, 2012, Morissette was inducted into the Guitar Center RockWalk in Hollywood. She received the UCLA Spring Sing's George and Ira Gershwin Award on May 16, 2014, at Pauley Pavilion. On her website starting in summer 2014, in celebration of her fortieth birthday, the LP record for her song "Big Sur" was offered for sale, which was previously available on the Target edition of her 2012 album, <i>Havoc and Bright Lights</i>. July 25, 2014, was the start of the ten-show Intimate and Acoustic tour. In 2015, she was named to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.
</p><p>In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the release of <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, a new four-disc collector's edition was released on October 30, 2015. The four-disc edition includes remastered audio of the original album as well as an entire disc of 10 unreleased demos from the era, handpicked by Morissette from her archives, offering a deeper and more personal look at the classic album. Also included is a previously unreleased concert from 1995 as well as 2005's <i>Jagged Little Pill Acoustic</i>.
</p><p>While on tour in August 2017, Morissette teased a song which would become known as "I Miss The Band". On October 27, 2017, she premiered a new song entitled "Rest", which was released officially in May 2021, and performed "Castle of Glass" with members of the band No Doubt and Mike Shinoda at the Linkin Park and Friends – Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington memorial concert. In November 2017, she tweeted that she was writing 22 songs with Michael Farrell.
</p><p>On March 16, 2018, Morissette performed a new song called "Ablaze" during her 2018 tour. In October 2018, she revealed on social media that she had written 23 new songs, and hinted at a new album with hashtag "#alanismorissettenewrecord2019", after a six-year hiatus. Song titles from the writing session include "Reckoning", "Diagnosis", "Her" and "Legacy". On May 5, 2018, <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, a jukebox musical featuring Morissette's songs, premiered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the American Repertory Theater. Morissette contributed two new songs to the musical, "Smiling" and "Predator". It transferred to Broadway in fall 2019, starting previews on November 3 and opening on December 5 at the Broadhurst Theatre. It received fifteen Tony Award nominations, the most of any production that season. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, including Morissette being the principal lyricist and co-composer.

<p>In June 2019, Morissette went into the studio in Los Angeles. According to an interview, she had written all the songs, and "Smiling" would be included on the new album, likely to be released early 2020. On August 8, 2019, she revealed that the new album was produced by Alex Hope and Catherine Marks. On December 1, 2019, she announced her first studio album in eight years, <i>Such Pretty Forks in the Road</i>, set for release on May 1, 2020. The first single off the record, "Reasons I Drink", was released on December 2, 2019. Morissette was featured on Halsey's song "Alanis' Interlude", released on January 17, 2020. On February 5, 2020, she revealed that her upcoming album was mixed by Chris Dugan. The second single from the album, "Smiling", was released on February 20, 2020. On April 15, 2020, Morissette announced that the album's release would be postponed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on July 31, 2020.
</p>

<p>She was originally scheduled to embark on a world tour for the 25th anniversary of <i>Jagged Little Pill</i> in June 2020 with Garbage and Liz Phair, both of whom already opened for Morissette in 1999 during Junkie Tour.
