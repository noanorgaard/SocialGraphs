<p><b>Living Colour</b> is an American rock band from New York City, formed in 1984. The band consists of guitarist Vernon Reid, lead vocalist Corey Glover, drummer Will Calhoun and bassist Doug Wimbish who replaced Muzz Skillings in 1992. Their music is influenced by heavy metal, funk, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and alternative rock. The band's lyrics range from the personal to the political, including social commentary on racism in the United States.
</p><p>Living Colour has released six studio albums. The band rose to fame with their debut album <i>Vivid</i> in 1988. Although they scored several hits, Living Colour is best known for their signature song "Cult of Personality", which won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990 and has been consistently used as the entrance theme for professional wrestler CM Punk since 2011. They were named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, and won their second Grammy Award for their follow-up album <i>Time's Up</i> (1990). Their third album, <i>Stain</i> (1993), was also well received by music critics. After disbanding in 1995, Living Colour reunited in late 2000, and has since released three more studio albums: <i>Collideøscope</i> (2003), <i>The Chair in the Doorway</i> (2009) and <i>Shade</i> (2017). The band has been working on new material for the follow-up to <i>Shade</i>.

<p>British-born guitarist Vernon Reid had formed several bands in the years before forming Living Colour in New York in 1984, using the British spelling of "colour". Reid assembled several bands under the name Vernon Reid's Living Colour from 1984 to 1986.  Reid was well known on the downtown New York jazz scenes because of his tenure in Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society.
</p><p>Early band members included bassists Alex Mosely, Jerome Harris and Carl James, drummers Greg Carter, Pheeroan akLaff and J. T. Lewis, keyboardist Geri Allen, and vocalists D. K. Dyson and Mark Ledford, with Reid occasionally singing lead vocals himself. The band's sound was vastly different from the songs later in their significant label recordings. Material from this period included instrumental jazz/funk workouts, politically pointed punk rock burners, experimental excursions via Reid's guitar synth, and an early version of the song "Funny Vibe", which was reworked for their debut album <i>Vivid</i>.

<p>In 1986 a stable lineup was formed, consisting of vocalist/actor Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun. After hiring managers Jim Grant and Roger Cramer, the band hired prodigy lighting designer Andy Elias in November 1986 to strengthen their live shows with explosive visual productions. The band became experienced at touring and performed regular gigs at the club CBGB. Around this time, their career also benefited from Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger's involvement. Jagger's interest in Living Colour was piqued when Vernon Reid auditioned for the album <i>Primitive Cool</i>; Jagger then arranged to see them live at CBGBs. Jagger went on to produce two of their demos. His endorsement encouraged major record labels to renew their interest in Living Colour, resulting in a recording contract with Epic Records. Interviewed in 2018, Vernon Reid looked back on the deal as a bittersweet triumph; "We had to get the co-sign from a person who literally embodied what rock 'n' roll is, the fact that he had to come see us, and dig us, for us to get at the back of the line is crazy."
</p><p><i>Vivid</i>, released on May 3, 1988, gathered sales momentum when, later that year, MTV began playing the video for "Cult of Personality". The album reached No. 6 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. On April 1, 1989, the band performed on NBC's <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. Four months later, the band gained further exposure as an opening act, along with Guns N' Roses, for The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour.
</p><p>In 1990, the band's second album, <i>Time's Up</i>, featured songs in a variety of musical contexts; jazz fusion, punk rock, Delta blues, hip hop (cameos by Queen Latifah and Doug E. Fresh), funk, thrash metal, jive, and hints of electronica were all represented. The album reached No. 13 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. Other guests included Maceo Parker and Little Richard. The title track was "inspired" by pioneer punk group Bad Brains, Vernon Reid said in 2025 during a performance on NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts, with Corey Glover joking that "we stole it (the song) from them."
</p><p>In 1991, Living Colour joined the inaugural Lollapalooza tour, and released an EP of outtakes entitled <i>Biscuits</i>.

<p>In 1992, Skillings left the band and was replaced by Doug Wimbish. This new lineup released their third album, <i>Stain</i>, in March 1993. The album reached No. 26 in the U.S., a further drop since its debut. Despite retaining their strong fan base, Living Colour disbanded in January 1995 after failing to settle on common musical goals during their fourth studio album sessions. Four of these tracks were included on the compilation <i>Pride</i>. Following the breakup, individual band members released a variety of solo efforts.

<p>Living Colour re-formed on December 21, 2000, at CBGB as a gig billed "Head>>Fake w/ special guests". Head>>Fake was the current drum and bass project headed by Calhoun and Wimbish. Glover was on the bill to sing a few songs, and Reid came on after three songs. The reunion was followed by the release of the band's fourth studio album, <i>Collideøscope</i>, in 2003, their first album not to chart in the United States, although it was critically praised. In 2005, Sony Records released <i>Live from CBGB's</i>, a live album recorded on December 19, 1989, as well as another best-of compilation, <i>Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour</i>, with songs from <i>Vivid</i> to <i>Collideøscope</i>. On September 22, 2006, Skillings joined the band for the first time in fourteen years when they played at a private party that drummer Jack DeJohnette threw for his wife, Lydia. Wimbish could not come back from his base in London to play for the event, so Skillings agreed to take over for the special private event.

Punk had used this song before when he used to perform for Ring of Honor. Upon joining WWE, he did not try to get the song as his theme because he believed that WWE will not get a song licensed for a mid-card wrestler. He used the song for his AEW run as well between 2021 and 2023. CM Punk also entered to the song for his debut mixed martial arts bout at UFC 203 and subsequently at UFC 225 for his fight versus Mike Jackson.
