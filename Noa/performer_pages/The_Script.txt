<h3 data-mw-anchor="Early_years">Early years</h3>
<p>Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan had been best friends since they were 12 growing up in Dublin. They were formerly part of a boy band called Mytown, formed in 1996. Striking up a songwriting and production partnership, they were invited to Canada to collaborate with some of their heroes, including Dallas Austin, Montell Jordan and Teddy Riley. They were in the US for a few years and got a record deal until the company split and dropped them.
</p><p>They stayed in Los Angeles and worked there as producers, writing and producing songs for performers including Britney Spears, Boyz II Men and TLC, but later moved back to Dublin, where they recruited drummer Glen Power for their new band the Script. Power learned to play drums when he was just eight and he had been playing sessions from the age of 15, using the money to work on a solo project in his home, but that went on hold when his collaboration with Sheehan and O'Donoghue produced three songs in one week. The band signed to Phonogenic in 2005, and released an EP on Last.FM. The band's influences include Snow Patrol, U2, Coldplay, the Police, the Neptunes, Timbaland, and Van Morrison.
