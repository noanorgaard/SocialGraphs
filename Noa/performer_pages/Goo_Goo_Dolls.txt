<p>The <b>Goo Goo Dolls</b> are an American rock band based in Buffalo, New York, composed of lead vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik, bassist and vocalist Robby Takac, as well as several rotating members since its formation in 1986.
</p><p>After starting off as a cover band and then developing a punk sound, Goo Goo Dolls experienced mainstream success following the 1995 release of their breakthrough single, "Name". The band is renowned for their 1998 single, "Iris", which spent 11 consecutive months on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and peaked atop the Hot 100 Airplay chart for 18 weeks. In October 2012, "Iris" placed first on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s "Top 100 Pop Songs 1992–2012" chart. Other notable singles include "Slide", "Black Balloon", and "Broadway" from <i>Dizzy Up the Girl</i> (1998); "Here Is Gone" from <i>Gutterflower</i> (2002); and "Better Days", "Give a Little Bit", and "Stay with You" from <i>Let Love In</i> (2006).
</p><p>The band has had seven top-40 singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, which includes three top tens. They have sold 15 million records worldwide, and received four Grammy Award nominations.

<p>The band's original lineup included John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals), Robby Takac (bass, vocals), and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac's cousin, Paul Takac, and close friend Michael Harvey who was the inspiration for the band.  In 1999 Rolling Stone reported the trio picked their name from a <i>True Detective</i> ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll. In 2022, Rzeznik said he didn't remember how they picked the name. "We had a gig and so we had to come up with some kind of a name just to play the show", Rzeznik said. "It's kind of a stupid name."
</p><p>The band started out playing covers, but went on to develop a punk sound. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, <i>Goo Goo Dolls,</i> in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. They played around Buffalo's underground music circuit and across the country opening for punk bands such as Gang Green, SNFU, Dag Nasty, Bad Religion, Motörhead, ALL, The Dead Milkmen, Doughboys, Big Drill Car, The Gun Club, Uniform Choice, The Dickies, and DRI and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album, <i>Jed</i>, in 1989.
</p><p>The band released its third album, <i>Hold Me Up</i>, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single "There You Are"—as well as their then-concert favorite, "Two Days in February". After being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock into the album. In 1991, the song "I'm Awake Now" was recorded for the soundtrack of <i>Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare</i>.
</p><p><i>Superstar Car Wash</i>, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The single "We Are the Normal", co-written with Paul Westerberg of The Replacements, Westerberg providing the lyrics, received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, and its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. "Fallin' Down" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film <i>Son in Law</i>.

<p>Just before <i>A Boy Named Goo'</i>s release, Tutuska was fired from the band and replaced by Mike Malinin. Prior to Tutuska's departure, there was a payment dispute between him and Rzeznik over Tutuska's contribution to the writing of the <i>Superstar Car Wash</i> single "Fallin' Down". During the completion of <i>A Boy Named Goo</i>, Tutuska had told band management that he would not tour behind the album unless royalties were to be split evenly among the three members, a practice Tutuska said had been the band's standard practice ever since the release of its self-titled debut in 1987. Tutuska has said that when he told Rzeznik he had not received royalties from "Fallin' Down", Rzeznik admitted that he had been receiving such royalties for two years.
</p><p><i>A Boy Named Goo</i>, released in 1995, had a catchy rock sound, and became one of the most successful alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s. <i>A Boy Named Goo</i> became the first album in Metal Blade history to achieve double-platinum status. The single "Name" was particularly successful on the record. This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade. The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their album's sales, which was attributed to a "grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract" which had been signed by the band in 1987. The two sides reached a settlement which had the band signed to the Metal Blade's distributing label, Warner Bros. Records, under which the band released their sixth album, <i>Dizzy Up the Girl</i>, in 1998.
</p><p>The Goo Goo Dolls experienced mainstream success following the 1995 release of their breakthrough single, "Name". The success of "Name" marked a fundamental change in the band's sound from alternative rock to a more mainstream, adult-oriented direction; this disappointed many of the original fans of the band. "Name" made the band popular, and led to guest appearances on <i>Beverly Hills, 90210</i> and <i>Charmed.</i>

<p>Rzeznik was approached to write a song for the <i>City of Angels</i> soundtrack, and the end product was "Iris".  Session guitarist Tim Pierce played the mandolin intro and also the slide guitar solo.  This song continued the band's fame, as it stayed on top of <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 Airplay charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks and spent 4 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Pop Songs chart. Iris held the record for the most weeks on the radio for almost 22 years before The Weeknd released "Blinding Lights" and broke the long-standing record on August 22, 2020. Shortly after Iris was released in 1998, it was nominated for three Grammys. According to several interviews with Rzeznik, he was experiencing serious bouts of writer's block when he was approached, and was on the verge of quitting the band days before he wrote the song.
</p><p>"Iris" was included on the quintuple-platinum <i>Dizzy Up the Girl</i>, considered their most successful album, and was among top-ten hits "Slide", "Black Balloon", "Broadway", and "Dizzy" from the same album. In 2001, the Goos released their first ever compilation CD, <i>What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce</i>. Next, <i>Gutterflower</i> (2002) achieved gold certification, producing the hits "Here Is Gone", "Sympathy", and "Big Machine". On July 4, 2004, the band performed a free concert in Buffalo, playing through a deluge of rain that can be seen on the DVD released later that year. The DVD also contained a studio version of the Goo Goo Dolls' cover of "Give a Little Bit" by Supertramp. The single reached the top of the Adult Top 40 chart in 2005. July 4, 2004, has been proclaimed "Goo Goo Dolls Day" in their native Buffalo, New York.

<p>In 2006, the Goo Goo Dolls marked their 20th anniversary with their new album <i>Let Love In</i>, which included the studio recording of "Give a Little Bit" as well as other top 10 radio singles "Better Days", "Stay with You", and "Let Love In".  With their third consecutive single ("Let Love In") from the album, the Goo Goo Dolls hit a record 12 top 10 hits in Adult Top 40 history; upon the release of "Before It's Too Late", that total increased to 13.

</p><p>On June 27, 2007, the Goo Goo Dolls performed to a sold-out crowd at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. The entire concert was released as a DVD on the limited edition version of their 2008 release, <i>Vol.2</i>. Though the album has not (as of 2007) been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), various music sites have asserted that it has gone gold.

</p><p><i>Something for the Rest of Us</i> was released on August 31, 2010.
