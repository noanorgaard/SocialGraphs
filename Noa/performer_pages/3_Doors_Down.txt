<p>3 Doors Down was formed in 1996 by Escatawpa, Mississippi natives Brad Arnold (lead vocals and drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar and backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass guitar). While the trio were walking through the town of Foley, Alabama during a trip there, they noticed a building where some letters had fallen off its sign, reading "Doors Down". Since the band consisted of three people at the time, they added the number 3 to create "3 Doors Down". 
</p><p>Arnold wrote the band's breakout hit single, "Kryptonite" in high school during math class at age 15.
</p><p>The three-piece began to record demo material in 1997. The demo recording sessions took place at the Holly House Recording studio in Biloxi, Mississippi. The band's demo songs were mixed and recorded by Clyde Holly, with the recordings being released on a self-titled CD in 1997. 1,000 copies of the demo CD were released initially, with 1,000 more copies being released two years later. When the band gave the CD to local radio station WCPR-FM, they started playing the demo recording of "Kryptonite" and it became the No. 1 requested song on the station for over 15 weeks. The station's program director sent the song to manager Phin Daly who in turn showed it to Bill McGathy, his employer at In De Goot Entertainment. 
</p><p>In 1998, two years after the band formed, Harrell asked rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson, who was previously in a band named Burning Bridges, to join the group. The band was booked in New York to perform a showcase at the CBGB music club. Daly told HitQuarters: "Once they got on stage and started playing it was apparent the magic was in the music. So we moved to sign them."

<p>3 Doors Down's first studio album, <i>The Better Life</i>, was released on February 8, 2000. It went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over four million copies. It was certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 26, 2020, signifying over seven million units sold in the United States, thanks in large part to the international hit singles "Kryptonite", "Loser", and "Duck and Run".

 Released in April 2000, "Kryptonite" reached number three on the charts and became the band's breakout hit, receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song. A fourth single, "Be Like That" was re-recorded for the 2001 film <i>American Pie 2</i>, with alternate lyrics for the first three lines; this version is known as the "<i>American Pie 2</i> Edit". While recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum tracks. The band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of <i>The Better Life</i> so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left the group and was later replaced by Canadian percussionist Daniel Adair, who toured with them and did studio sessions.
</p><p>The band's second studio album, <i>Away from the Sun</i>, was released on November 30, 2002 and peaked at number eight on the charts. The album produced the singles "When I'm Gone", "Here Without You", and "The Road I'm On". <i>Away from the Sun</i> went platinum within two months of release and eventually went multi-platinum; it sold four million copies worldwide, including well over three million in the U.S. "When I'm Gone" received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, respectively. Session drummer Josh Freese was hired to record drums for the album. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson produced and performed on three tracks for the record, "Dangerous Game", "Dead Love", and "Wasted Me", but only "Dangerous Game" would appear on the finished product.  The band hired Canadian Daniel Adair to play drums for the <i>Away From the Sun</i> tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the USS <i>George Washington</i> (CVN-73) to film the music video "When I'm Gone".
</p><p>In 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled <i>Another 700 Miles</i> consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois. <i>Another 700 Miles</i> has since been certified Gold in the United States. In addition to featuring some of 3 Doors Down's hit singles from their previous two albums, the EP also contains a version of the popular 1977 Lynyrd Skynyrd song "That Smell". The group toured with Nickelback in 2004.
</p><p>In 2003, the band began hosting the annual "3 Doors Down and Friends" benefit concert through the band's own charity, The Better Life Foundation. In 2006, this event was held at the Mobile Convention Center, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Katrina survivors. As residents of Escatawpa, the members of the band saw the effects of Katrina's devastation.

Guitarist Chris Henderson announced on Twitter that his former guitar tech Chet Roberts would be taking over from Matt Roberts on lead guitar.
</p><p>After the "Gang of Outlaws" tour finished, the band said in an interview that they were entering the studio to record three or four new songs for their first Greatest Hits album, which was released on November 19, 2012.

</p><p>On April 20, 2013, bassist Todd Harrell was charged with vehicular homicide for his actions the night before in Nashville, Tennessee. He was reportedly driving on I-40 at high speed while under the influence of prescription medication when he caused an accident that killed 47-year-old Paul Howard Shoulders Jr. The judge in the case harshly criticized the musician's doctor in the courtroom, accusing the physician of prescribing Harrell far too many pain pills. Harrell was also charged with bringing controlled substances into a correctional detention facility. In December 2015, Harrell was sentenced to two years' imprisonment followed by six years of probation.
</p><p>3 Doors Down later announced that the four scheduled shows in the U.S. for April and May had been cancelled out of respect for Shoulders and his family. The European tour with Prime Circle and the summer tour dates with Daughtry, which had been announced the day after the incident in Nashville, remained intact. On May 24, a week before the start on the European tour, Justin Biltonen, formerly of The Campaign 1984, was announced as the band's new bassist.

<p>From the end of 2013 into 2014, the band embarked on an acoustic tour entitled "Songs from the Basement" and toured around the US. In February 2014, Todd Harrell was arrested in Mississippi once again for a DUI. Afterward, the band released a statement that Harrell was permanently out of the band, and that they would continue with Justin Biltonen as his replacement. In June, Henderson announced that the band's next album would be entitled <i>Us and the Night</i>. In January 2016, the album's release date was revealed to be March 11, 2016.

</p><p>Former guitarist Matt Roberts died on August 20, 2016, at the age of 38 from a prescription drug overdose.
</p><p>3 Doors Down performed at the presidential inauguration concert of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Arnold told <i>TMZ</i> that he was "proud" to perform and that he thought it would be a "good experience". Fans of the band expressed mixed to negative feedback about it performing at the inauguration. 3 Doors Down's business manager, Angus Vail, explained to <i>Vice</i> the reasons behind the band's decision to perform by saying: "Well, 3 Doors actually played George W. Bush's inauguration. They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys — they come from conservative families. You know, they're really good guys, but they have very different political beliefs. Because they played both Bush's inaugurations, they've obviously been on the conservative radar." Vail continued that the band's choice to perform had a lot to do with their "God, guns, and country black-and-white sort of viewpoint" and that "they spend a lot of time going to Iraq, doing service, playing for the troops." In the week following the performance, the band's <i>The Greatest Hits</i> compilation album reentered the Billboard 200 at a new peak of No. 94; the album had debuted and peaked at No. 100 in 2012 and had been off the chart since April 2016. In February 2018, during an interview with Detroit Metro Times, rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson stated about the performance, "it wasn't a Trump thing. That's what people don't understand. It was the inauguration of a president of the United States of America." and "this is history-making stuff. It's a one-in-a-lifetime chance to do something for your country. So that's why we did it."
</p><p>In 2018, 3 Doors Down embarked on the Rock n' Roll Express tour with Collective Soul and opening act Soul Asylum. The tour had shows in 36 cities in the United States.

<p>In July 2018, Arnold stated that 3 Doors Down had been writing new material; "Who knows when we'll follow that one up. But we have been writing new songs.

But fans still like going out and seeing us." In August 2019, Arnold stated that the band would soon begin working on a follow-up to <i>Us and the Night</i>.
