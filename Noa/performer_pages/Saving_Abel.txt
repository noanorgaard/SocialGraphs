<p><b>Saving Abel</b> is an American rock band from Corinth, Mississippi, founded in 2004 by Jason Null and Jared Weeks. The band is named after the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Null came up with the name, saying "I Googled the story of Cain and Abel and found a line about 'there was no saving Abel', which just jumped out at me".

<p>Lead guitarist Jason Null and lead singer Jared Weeks formed Saving Abel in Corinth, Mississippi, in 2004. Weeks and Null started writing songs together a few days after they met. Early in 2005, their songs caught the ear of producer Skidd Mills, who brought them into his 747 Studio in Memphis, Tennessee to record some of the songs.
</p><p>The band came together with the addition of rhythm guitarist Scott Bartlett, bassist Daniel Dwight, and drummer Blake Dixon. Weeks would throw demo CDs onto the stages of bigger bands that toured through Corinth. After shopping the album around for almost a year and Dwight leaving the group, they recruited bassist Eric Taylor.
</p><p>"Addicted" was first played on Memphis radio station, WMFS, where program director Rob Cressman featured the song in regular rotation based on its strong local appeal. "Addicted" was heard by a Virgin A&amp;R consultant, who e-mailed the song to CEO of Virgin Music Company Jason Flom. Flom liked it and sent Kim Stephens to watch the band perform in Jackson, Tennessee. "Addicted" was released in March 2008 as a single followed by their major label debut, <i>Saving Abel</i>, on March 11, 2008. "Addicted" rose to No. 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Rock Songs chart. On January 15, 2009, the album peaked at No. 49 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The album was certified Gold in the week of March 16, 2009.
</p><p>In mid-2009, the band toured with Nickelback during their Dark Horse Tour, along with Hinder and Papa Roach, bringing the band through Live Nation outdoor amphitheaters. In April 2009, the band denied allegations of a rivalry with Hinder.
</p><p>Virgin released the Saving Abel EP, <i>18 Days Tour</i>, on April 7, 2009, which contained an acoustic version of the song "18 Days" and two new songs. In the latter part of 2009, Saving Abel headlined a U.S. tour with Red, Pop Evil and Taddy Porter in supporting slots.
</p><p>The band worked on their second studio album, <i>Miss America,</i> throughout late 2009 and early 2010. During the making of the record, the song "The Sex Is Good" was leaked onto YouTube. The new album, which offered a downloadable only acoustic version of the song "The Sex Is Good", was released via Virgin Records on June 8, 2010. The first single, "Stupid Girl (Only In Hollywood)", was released earlier that year on April 8 and hit radio on April 26. The song went to No. 7 on the Mainstream Rock Song chart. "The Sex Is Good" was the second single, reaching the No. 1 spot on the same chart in January 2011. The third single was "Miss America".
</p><p>In 2011, they embarked on a tour where they played at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, as well as many barbecues, chili cook-offs, motorcycle rallies and state fairs. They also played for the American military in Kuwait.
</p><p>On May 14, 2012, the band debuted "Bringing Down the Giant". Their third album, <i>Bringing Down the Giant</i>, was released on July 17, 2012. They went on a tour to promote their new album.
</p><p>On April 20, 2013, Saving Abel performed in Waterloo, Iowa, to raise funds for the creation of Angel's Park in Evansdale, Iowa. The park was inspired by Elizabeth Collins and Lyric Cook, who vanished in July 2012, and were found dead in December.
</p><p>On May 21, 2013, Saving Abel released information on their website regarding <i>Cracking the Safe</i>, set to be released on August 6, 2013.

Scotty Austin, frontman for Trash the Brand, was announced as Weeks' permanent replacement. The same day, drummer Michael McManus announced his departure from the band via Twitter. No reason was given, and the band did not comment. Steven Pulley was announced as replacement drummer.
</p><p>On November 11, 2014, they released their latest album, <i>Blood Stained Revolution</i>. The final single off the album, "15 Minutes of Fame", was released on February 22, 2015.
