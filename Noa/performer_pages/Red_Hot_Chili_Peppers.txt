<p>The <b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, consisting of Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), John Frusciante (guitar), and Chad Smith (drums). Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock, and have influenced genres including funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the top-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles on the American Alternative Songs charts (15), most cumulative weeks at number one (91) and most top-ten songs (28) on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart. They have won three Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</p><p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, the guitarist Hillel Slovak and the drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on their 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured the guitarist Jack Sherman and the drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985), and Irons for their third, <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.
</p><p>With Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989) and their first major commercial success, <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro. Their next album, <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995), failed to match the success of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.
</p><p>In 1998, Navarro departed and Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, <i>Californication</i> (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. <i>By the Way</i> (2002) and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) were also successful; <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> was their first album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on <i>I'm with You</i> (2011) and <i>The Getaway</i> (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. The Chili Peppers released their 12th and 13th albums, <i>Unlimited Love</i> and <i>Return of the Dream Canteen</i>, in 2022.

<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles in 1982 as Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem by singer Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea, and drummer Jack Irons, classmates at Fairfax High School. Their first performance was on December 16, 1982, at the Grandia Room club on Hollywood Boulevard to a crowd of approximately 30. Gary Allen, a friend of the band, was hosting a release party for his new EP and asked Kiedis and Flea to put together an opening act.
</p><p>At the time, Slovak and Irons were already committed to another group, What Is This?; however, the new band was asked to return the following week. In March, they changed their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing several shows at Los Angeles venues. Six songs from these shows were on the band's first demo tape. In November 1983, manager Lindy Goetz struck a seven-album deal with EMI America and Enigma Records. Two weeks earlier, however, What Is This? had also obtained a record deal with MCA, and in December Slovak and Irons quit the Red Hot Chili Peppers to focus on What Is This?. Flea and Kiedis recruited Weirdos drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman.
</p><p>The band released their debut album, <i>The Red Hot Chili Peppers</i>, in August 1984. Airplay on college radio and MTV helped build a fan base, and the album sold 300,000 copies. Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill, who produced the album, pushed the band to play with a cleaner, more radio-friendly sound, and the band was disappointed with the result, finding it over-polished. The album included backing vocals by Gwen Dickey, the singer for the 1970s disco funk group Rose Royce. The band embarked on a grueling tour, performing 60 shows in 64 days. During the tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired in February 1985 and Slovak, who had just quit What Is This?, rejoined the band.

<p>The second Chili Peppers album, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985), was produced by funk musician George Clinton, who introduced elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley. The band used heroin while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and music. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but <i>Freaky Styley</i>, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The band also considered the subsequent tour unproductive. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with <i>Freaky Styley</i>; Kiedis reflected that "it so surpassed anything we thought we could have done that we were thinking we were on the road to enormity." Around this time, the band appeared in the 1986 films <i>Thrashin'</i>, playing the song "Blackeyed Blonde" from <i>Freaky Styley,</i> and <i>Tough Guys</i>, performing the unreleased song "Set It Straight".
</p><p>In early 1986, EMI gave the Chili Peppers $5,000 to record a demo tape for their next album. They chose to work with producer Keith Levene from Public Image Ltd, as he shared their interest in drugs. Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on heroin and cocaine, which created tension between the band members. Martinez's "heart was no longer in the band", but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him in April 1986. Irons rejoined the band, to their surprise; it marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983. During the recording and subsequent tour of <i>Freaky Styley</i>, Kiedis and Slovak were dealing with debilitating heroin addictions. Due to his addiction, Kiedis "didn't have the same drive or desire to come up with ideas or lyrics" and appeared at rehearsal "literally asleep".
</p><p>For their third album, the Chili Peppers attempted to hire Rick Rubin to produce, but he declined due to the band's increasing drug problems. They eventually hired Michael Beinhorn from the art funk project Material, their last choice. The early attempts at recording were halted due to Kiedis' worsening drug problems, and Kiedis was briefly fired. After the band were named "band of the year" by <i>LA Weekly</i>, Kiedis entered drug rehabilitation. The band auditioned new singers, but Kiedis, now sober, rejoined the recording sessions with new enthusiasm. Songs formed quickly, blending the funk feel and rhythms of <i>Freaky Styley</i> with a harder, more immediate approach to punk rock. The album was recorded in the basement of the Capitol Records Building. The recording process was difficult; Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs; after fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis had decided to take drugs again to celebrate his new music.
</p><p>The third Red Hot Chili Peppers album, <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i>, was released in September 1987 and peaked at No. 148 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, a significant improvement over their earlier albums. The band immediately embarked on a two and a half month North American tour to promote the release, accompanied by Faith No More as support who were also promoting their new album <i>Introduce Yourself</i>. During that period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, often disappearing for days on end. Slovak died from a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, soon after the conclusion of the <i>Uplift</i> tour. Kiedis fled the city and did not attend Slovak's funeral. Irons, troubled by the death, left the band; following years of depression, he became a member of the Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam in 1994.

<p>DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight, a former member of Parliament-Funkadelic, joined as guitarist, and D. H. Peligro of Dead Kennedys joined as drummer. Kiedis re-entered rehab for 30 days, and visited Slovak's grave as part of his rehabilitation, finally confronting his grief. Three dates into the tour, McKnight was fired for lack of chemistry with the band. McKnight was so unhappy he threatened to burn down Kiedis' house.
</p><p>Peligro introduced Kiedis and Flea to the 18-year-old guitarist John Frusciante, a fan of the band, who brought a darker and more melodic style. Frusciante performed his first show with the Chili Peppers in September 1988. The new lineup began writing for the next album and went on a short tour, the Turd Town Tour. In November, Kiedis and Flea fired Peligro due to his drug and alcohol problems. After open auditions, they hired the drummer Chad Smith in December 1988, who has remained since. According to Smith, "We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically."
</p><p>The Chili Peppers began work on their fourth album in late 1988. Unlike the stop-start sessions for <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan,</i> preproduction went smoothly. However, the sessions were made tense by Beinhorn's desire to create a hit, frustrating Frusciante and Kiedis. Released on August 16, 1989, <i>Mother's Milk</i> peaked at number 52 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200. The record failed to chart in the United Kingdom and Europe, but climbed to number 33 in Australia. "Knock Me Down" reached number six on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart, whereas "Higher Ground" charted at number eleven and reached number 54 in the UK and 45 in Australia and France. <i>Mother's Milk</i> was certified gold in March 1990 and was the first Chili Peppers album to ship over 500,000 units.

<p>In 1990, after the success of <i>Mother's Milk</i>, the Chili Peppers left EMI and entered a major-label bidding war. They signed with Warner Bros. Records and hired Rick Rubin, a producer they had tried to hire before. Rubin turned the band down in 1987 because of their drug problems but he felt that they were now healthier and more focused. He produced several more of their albums. The writing process was more productive than it had been for <i>Mother's Milk</i>, with Kiedis saying, "[every day], there was new music for me to lyricize". At Rubin's suggestion, they recorded in The Mansion, a studio in a house in Laurel Canyon where magician Harry Houdini once lived.
</p><p>In September 1991, <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> was released. "Give It Away" was the first single, which achieved international fame and became the band's first number-one single on the Modern Rock chart. The ballad "Under the Bridge" was the second single, and reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart, the band's highest position to date. <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> sold over 12 million copies. It was listed at number 310 on <i>Rolling Stone's</i> list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and in 1992 it rose to number three on the US album charts, almost a year after its release. The album was accompanied by a documentary, <i>Funky Monks</i>. The Chili Peppers began their <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> tour, which featured Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins, three of the era's biggest upcoming bands in alternative music, as opening acts.
</p><p>Frusciante was troubled by fame, and began falling out with Kiedis. He isolated himself and developed a secret heroin addiction. In an appearance on <i>Saturday Night Live,</i> he performed off-key; Kiedis believed he wanted to sabotage the performance. Frusciante abruptly quit after a show in Tokyo in May 1992. He returned to Los Angeles and spent years living in squalor, struggling with addiction. The Chili Peppers contacted Dave Navarro to replace Frusciante. Navarro had just split from Jane's Addiction, but he was involved in drug problems too. After failed auditions with Zander Schloss, they hired Arik Marshall of the Los Angeles band Marshall Law, and headlined the Lollapalooza festival in 1992. Marshall appeared in the music videos for "Breaking the Girl" and "If You Have to Ask", as well as the <i>Simpsons</i> episode "Krusty Gets Kancelled". In September 1992, the Chili Peppers performed "Give It Away" at the MTV Video Music Awards. They were nominated for seven awards, winning three, including Viewer's Choice. In February 1993, they performed "Give It Away" at the Grammy Awards, and the song won the band their first Grammy, Best Hard Rock Performance With Vocal.
</p><p>The Chili Peppers dismissed Marshall and held auditions for a new guitarist, including Buckethead, whom Flea felt was not right for the band. Jesse Tobias of the Los Angeles band Mother Tongue was briefly hired, but dismissed due to poor chemistry. However, Navarro said he was now ready to join the band. In August 1993, the non-album single "Soul to Squeeze" was released and featured on the soundtrack to the film <i>Coneheads</i>. The song topped the Billboard US Modern Rock chart.

<p>Navarro first appeared with the Chili Peppers at Woodstock '94, performing early versions of new songs. This was followed by a brief tour, including headlining appearances at Pukkelpop and Reading Festivals and two performances as the opening act for the Rolling Stones. The relationship between Navarro and the band began to deteriorate; Navarro admitted he did not care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis had relapsed into heroin addiction following a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used, though the band did not discover this until later.
</p><p>Without Frusciante, songs were written at a far slower rate. Kiedis said: "John had been a true anomaly when it came to songwriting... I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave."
</p><p><i>One Hot Minute</i> was released in September 1995 after several delays. It departed from the Chili Peppers' previous sound, with Navarro's guitar work incorporating heavy metal riffs and psychedelic rock. The band described it as a darker, sadder record. Kiedis's lyrics addressed drugs, including the lead single, "Warped", and broken relationships and deaths of loved ones, including "Tearjerker", written about Kurt Cobain and "Transcending" about River Phoenix. Although it received mixed reviews, the album sold eight million copies worldwide. The band also contributed to soundtracks including <i>Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon</i> and <i>Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.</i> Flea and Navarro played on Alanis Morissette's single "You Oughta Know".
</p><p>The Chili Peppers began the tour for <i>One Hot Minute</i> in Europe in 1995. The US tour was postponed after Smith broke his wrist. In 1997, several shows were canceled following deteriorating band relations, injuries, and Navarro and Kiedis' drug use. The band played three shows that year, including the first Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In April 1998, the Chili Peppers announced that Navarro had left due to creative differences. Kiedis said the decision was mutual. Reports at the time indicated that Navarro's departure came after he attended a band practice under the influence of drugs.

<p>With no guitarist, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were on the verge of breaking up. In the years following Frusciante's departure, his heroin addiction had left him in poverty and near death. Flea convinced Frusciante to enter Las Encinas Drug Rehabilitation Center in eastern Pasadena, California, in January 1998. His addiction left him with scarring on his arms, a restructured nose, and dental implants following an oral infection. In April 1998, Flea visited the recovered Frusciante and asked him to rejoin the band. Frusciante began sobbing and said nothing would make him happier.
</p>

<p>In June 1999, after more than a year of production, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released <i>Californication</i>, their seventh studio album. It sold over 16 million copies, and remains their most successful album. <i>Californication</i> contained fewer rap songs than its predecessors, instead integrating textured and melodic guitar riffs, vocals and basslines. It produced three number-one modern rock hits, "Scar Tissue", "Otherside" and "Californication". <i>Californication</i> received stronger reviews than <i>One Hot Minute</i>, and was a greater success worldwide. While many critics credited the success of the album to Frusciante's return, they also felt Kiedis' vocals had also improved. It was later listed at number 399 on the <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
</p><p><i>Californication</i> was supported with a two-year international world tour, producing the first Chili Peppers concert DVD, <i>Off the Map</i> (2001). In July 1999, the Chili Peppers played the closing show at Woodstock 1999. During the set, a small fire escalated into violence and vandalism, resulting in the intervention of riot control squads. ATMs and several semi-tractor trailers were looted and destroyed. The band was blamed in the media for inciting the riots after performing a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song "Fire". In his memoir, Kiedis wrote: "It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in."

<p>The Chili Peppers began writing their next album in early 2001, immediately after the <i>Californication</i> tour. Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated for days straight, discussing and sharing guitar progressions and lyrics. For Kiedis, "writing <i>By the Way</i> ... was a whole different experience from <i>Californication</i>. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." The recording was difficult for Flea, who felt his role was being diminished and fought with Frusciante about the musical direction. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two worked out their problems.
</p>

<p><i>By the Way</i> was released in July 2002 and produced four singles; "By the Way", "The Zephyr Song", "Can't Stop" and "Universally Speaking". The album was their most subdued to date, focusing on melodic ballads over rap and funk, with layered textures, more keyboards, and string arrangements. The album was followed by an eighteen-month world tour, a concert DVD, <i>Live at Slane Castle</i>, and the band's first live album, <i>Red Hot Chili Peppers Live in Hyde Park</i>. More than 258,000 fans paid over $17,100,000 for tickets over three nights, a 2004 record; the event ranked No. 1 on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Top Concert Boxscores of 2004. In November 2003, the Chili Peppers released their <i>Greatest Hits</i> album, which featured new songs "Fortune Faded" and "Save the Population".

<p>In 2006, the Chili Peppers released their ninth album, <i>Stadium Arcadium</i>. Although they initially planned to release a trilogy of albums, they chose to release a 28-track double album. It was their first album to debut at number one on the US charts, where it stayed for two weeks, and debuted at number one in the UK and 25 other countries. <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> sold over seven million units. It won the Grammys for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal ("Dani California").
</p>

<p>The first single, "Dani California", was the band's fastest-selling single, debuting on top of the Modern Rock chart in the U.S., peaking at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and reaching number 2 in the UK. "Tell Me Baby", released next, also topped the charts in 2006. "Snow (Hey Oh)" was released in late 2006, breaking multiple records by 2007. The song became their eleventh number-one single, giving the band a cumulative total of 81 weeks at number one. It was also the first time three consecutive singles by the band made it to number one. "Desecration Smile" was released internationally in February 2007 and reached number 27 on the UK charts. "Hump de Bump" was planned to be the next single for the US, Canada, and Australia only, but due to positive feedback from the music video, it was released as a worldwide single in May 2007.
</p><p>The Stadium Arcadium World Tour began in 2006, including several festival dates. Frusciante's friend and frequent musical collaborator Josh Klinghoffer joined the touring band, contributing guitar, backing vocals, and keyboards. The band was a musical guest for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in May 2006 and Tom Hanks hosted the show.

<p>After the Stadium Arcadium tour, the Chili Peppers took an extended break. Kiedis attributed this to the band being worn out from their years of nonstop work since <i>Californication</i>. Their only recording during that time was in 2008 with George Clinton on his album <i>George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love;</i> accompanied by Kim Manning, they recorded a new version of Shirley and Lee's classic "Let the Good Times Roll".
</p><p>Kiedis, who had recently become a father, planned to spend the time taking care of his son and developing a television series based on his autobiography, <i>Spider and Son.</i> Flea began taking music theory classes at the University of Southern California, and revealed plans to release a mainly instrumental solo record; guest musicians included Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. He also joined Thom Yorke in the supergroup Atoms for Peace. Frusciante released his album <i>The Empyrean</i>. Smith worked with Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, and Michael Anthony in the supergroup Chickenfoot, as well as on his solo project, Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats.
</p><p>In July 2009, Frusciante again left the Chili Peppers, though no announcement was made until December. Frusciante explained on his Myspace page that there was no ill feeling about his departure this time, and that he wanted to focus on his solo work. In October 2009, the Chili Peppers entered the studio to begin writing their tenth studio album, with Klinghoffer replacing Frusciante. In January 2010, the Chili Peppers made their live comeback in January 2010, paying tribute to Neil Young with a cover of "A Man Needs a Maid" at MusiCares. In February, after months of speculation, Klinghoffer was confirmed as Frusciante's replacement.

<p>Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded their tenth album, <i>I'm with You</i>, between September 2010 and March 2011. They decided against releasing another double album, reducing the album to 14 tracks. <i>I'm with You</i> was released in the US in August 2011. It topped the charts in 18 countries, and received mostly positive reviews. "The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie", became the band's 12th number-one single. "Monarchy of Roses", "Look Around" and "Did I Let You Know" (released only in Brazil), and "Brendan's Death Song" were also released as singles.
</p>

<p>In July 2011, the Chili Peppers played three invitation-only warm-up shows in California, their first since 2007. They began a month-long promotional tour in August 2011, starting in Asia. The I'm with You World Tour ran from September 2011 until 2013. The North American leg, expected to begin in January 2012, was postponed to March due to a surgery Kiedis required for foot injuries he had sustained during the Stadium Arcadium tour. After the <i>I'm with You World Tour</i>, the band set out on another small tour, including their first shows in Alaska, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Recordings from the tours were released in 2012 on the free <i>2011 Live EP.</i>
</p>

<p>The Chili Peppers were nominated for two MTV Europe Music Awards for <i>Best Rock Band</i> and <i>Best Live Artist</i> and nominated for <i>Best Group</i> at the 2012 People's Choice Awards <i>I'm with You</i> was also nominated for a 2012 Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. In April 2012, the Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A month later <i>Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Covers EP</i>, was released for downloads only, consisting of previously released studio and live covers of artists which had influenced the band. From August 2012, the band began releasing a series of singles as the <i>I'm with You Sessions,</i> which were compiled on the <i>I'm Beside You</i> LP in November 2013 as a Record Store Day exclusive.
</p><p>In February 2014, the Chili Peppers joined Bruno Mars as performers at the Super Bowl XLVIII half-time show, watched by a record 115.3 million viewers. The performance was met with mixed reviews for its use of backing music; Flea responded that it was an NFL rule for bands to pre-record music due to time and technical issues, and that they had agreed because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He said Kiedis' vocals were completely live and the band had recorded "Give it Away" during rehearsals. The band began another tour in May 2013, which ended in June 2014. <i>2012-13 Live EP</i> was released in July 2014 through their website as a free download.

<p>The Chili Peppers released <i>Fandemonium</i> in November 2014, a book dedicated to their fans. In December 2014, they began work on their eleventh album, their first without producer Rick Rubin since 1989; instead it was produced by Danger Mouse. Flea broke his arm during a skiing trip, which delayed the recording for several months. "Dark Necessities", the first single from their upcoming album, was released on May 5. Their eleventh album, <i>The Getaway</i>, was released in June. Kiedis said that the songs were influenced by a two-year relationship that fell apart. "Dark Necessities" became the band's 25th top-ten single on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart, a record they hold over U2. In February 2016, "Circle of the Noose", an unreleased song recorded with Navarro in 1998, was leaked.
</p>

<p>In May, the band released "The Getaway". The music video for "Dark Necessities", directed by actress Olivia Wilde, was released in June 2016. <i>The Getaway</i> made its debut at number 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, behind Drake, who had the number-one album for eight consecutive weeks. <i>The Getaway</i> outsold Drake its opening week with album sales of 108,000 to 33,000 (actually placing him at 4th in sales for the week) though due to album streaming, Drake managed to top the band for the top position in the charts. In July 2016, the <i>Live In Paris EP</i> was released exclusively through the music streaming website Deezer. "Go Robot" was announced as the second single from <i>The Getaway</i>. In the same month, the band members started to post images from the set of the music video. <i>The Getaway</i> was reissued on limited edition pink vinyl in September, as part of 10 Bands 1 Cause. All money from sales of the re-issue went to Gilda's Club NYC an organization that provides community support for both those diagnosed with cancer and their caretakers.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Artistry">Artistry</h2>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h3>

<p>The music of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been characterized as funk rock, alternative rock, funk metal, and rap rock, with influences from hard, psychedelic, and punk rock. Regarding their genre, Flea stated in a 2006 <i>Guitar World</i> interview, "For all the styles that have come and gone through-out our career, we never really aligned ourselves with any of them; we were never part of any movement. At one time, people put us together in a category with Fishbone and Faith No More, but we were always different from those bands, and they were always different from us." The band's influences include Parliament-Funkadelic, Defunkt, Jimi Hendrix, the Misfits, Black Sabbath, Metallica, James Brown, Gang of Four, Bob Marley, Big Boys, Bad Brains, Sly and the Family Stone, Ohio Players, Queen, Stevie Wonder, Elvis Presley, Deep Purple, the Beach Boys, Black Flag, Ornette Coleman, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Fugazi, Fishbone, Marvin Gaye, Billie Holiday, Santana, Elvis Costello, the Stooges, the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Devo, and Miles Davis.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Vocals_and_instrumentation">Vocals and instrumentation</h3>
<p>Kiedis provided multiple vocal styles. His primary approach up to <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> was spoken verse and rapping, which he complemented with traditional vocals. This helped the band to maintain a consistent style. As the group matured, notably with <i>Californication</i> (1999), they reduced the number of rapped verses. <i>By the Way</i> (2002) contained only two songs with a rap-driven verse and melodic chorus. Kiedis' more recent style was developed through ongoing coaching.
</p><p>Original guitarist Slovak's style was based in blues and funk. Slovak was primarily influenced by hard-rock artists such as Hendrix, Kiss and Led Zeppelin, while his playing method was based on improvisation common in funk. He was noted for an aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would "come apart". Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, when Slovak adopted a more fluid style featuring "sultry" elements compared to his earlier hard-rock techniques. On <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal. His guitar riffs often served as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song "Behind the Sun" inspired the group to create "pretty" songs with an emphasis on melody. Kiedis describes the song as "pure Hillel inspiration". Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as "Green Heaven" and "Funky Crime", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.
</p><p>Frusciante's guitar playing style has evolved over the course of his career, with a technique that employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this. Frusciante brought a melodic and textured sound, notably on <i>Californication</i>, <i>By the Way</i>, and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006). This contrasts with his earlier abrasive approach in <i>Mother's Milk</i>, as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>. On <i>Californication</i> and <i>By the Way</i>, Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from post-punk guitarist Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column, and bands such as Fugazi and the Cure. On <i>By the Way</i>, he wanted people to be able to sing the lead guitar part, influenced by John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division. He initially wanted this album to be composed of "these punky, rough songs", drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as the Germs and the Damned, an English band. However, that was discouraged by Rubin, the producer. Instead he built on <i>Californication</i><span>'</span>s melodically driven style. During the recording of <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006), he moved away from his new-wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Hendrix and Van Halen. Navarro brought his own sound to the band during his tenure, with his style based on heavy metal, progressive rock, and psychedelia.
</p><p>Flea's bass guitar style can be considered an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock. The groove-heavy melodies, played through either finger-picking or slapping, contributed to their signature style. While Flea's slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used double stops on some newer songs. Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely around traditional punk-rock bass lines. However, he changed this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a "slap" bass style that drew influence largely from Bootsy Collins. <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but focused more on traditional and melodic roots. His intellectual beliefs as a musician also shifted: "I was trying to play simply on <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good."
</p><p>Drummer Smith blends rock with funk, mixing metal and jazz to his beats. Influences include Buddy Rich and John Bonham. He brought a different sound to <i>Mother's Milk</i>, playing tight and fast. In <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, he displays greater power. He is recognized for his ghost notes, his beats and his fast right foot. MusicRadar put him in sixth place on their list of the "50 Greatest Drummers Of All Time". During their early career, the Chili Peppers often performed nude, wearing only socks over their genitals; that became a part of their stage persona and brought them early notoriety.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Lyrical_themes_and_inspirations">Lyrical themes and inspirations</h3>
<p>Early in the group's history, Kiedis wrote comical songs filled with sexual innuendos and songs inspired by friendship and the band members' personal experiences. However, after the death of his close friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis' lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the <i>Mother's Milk</i> song "Knock Me Down", which was dedicated to Slovak along with the <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> song "My Lovely Man". When the band recorded <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995), Kiedis had turned to drugs once again, which resulted in darker lyrics. He began to write about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he experienced as a result of his drug addiction. The album also featured tributes to close friends the band lost during the recording process including Kurt Cobain on the song "Tearjerker" and River Phoenix on the song "Transcending".
</p><p>After witnessing Frusciante's recovery from his heroin addiction, Kiedis wrote many songs inspired by rebirth and the meaning of life on <i>Californication</i>. He was also intrigued by the life lessons that the band had learned, including Kiedis' experience with meeting a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.
</p><p>On <i>By the Way</i>, Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love and his girlfriend. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since 2000. Tracks such as "This Is the Place" and "Don't Forget Me" expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis said, that "love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles—those are real and profound influences on this record. And it's great, because it wasn't just me writing about the fact that I'm in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love." <i>I'm with You</i> (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend, this time in the song "Brendan's Death Song", a tribute to club owner Brendan Mullen who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.
</p><p>Themes within Kiedis' repertoire include love and friendship, teenage angst, good-time aggression, various sexual topics and the link between sex and music, political and social commentary (Native American issues in particular), romance, loneliness, globalization and the cons of fame and Hollywood, poverty, drugs, alcohol, dealing with death, and California.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Legacy_and_influence">Legacy and influence</h2>

<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers' mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. According to AllMusic, in 1992, "oodles of (mostly horribly bad) funk-metal acts were following in Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' footsteps". Bands who have cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence include Incubus, Mr. Bungle, Primus, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Papa Roach, 311, Sugar Ray and Korn. 
</p><p>Kiedis said the Red Hot Chili Peppers were early to combine "hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals", and suggested that they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock and Linkin Park. Smith said, "Certainly Anthony's singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it's hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I'm proud of that because sometimes bands don't have that strong personality where you go, 'Oh, that's boom, right away.'"
</p><p>In 2004, the Australian songwriter Nick Cave said: "I'm forever near a stereo saying, 'What the fuck is this garbage?' And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers." The line is widely quoted in criticism of the band; Flea, a fan of Cave, wrote that it had hurt him. In 2025, Cave wrote an apology on his website, saying it was "an offhand and somewhat uncharitable remark" with "no malice intended", and announced that he and Flea had recently collaborated.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Conviction_and_sexual_harassment">Conviction and sexual harassment</h3>
<p>On April 21, 1989, Kiedis was convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure after a concert at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. He exposed himself and pressed his penis to a woman's face against her wishes. He was fined $1,000 on each charge. In 1990, Kiedis said the incident was "blown way out of proportion by both the media and the prosecution", and was merely "a playful thing that happened backstage" with no intent of harm.
</p><p>In 1990, Flea and Smith were arrested on charges of battery in Daytona Beach, Florida, at a spring break performance for MTV. Flea was also charged with disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act. Flea picked up a 20-year-old woman and threw her into the sand, while Smith forcibly removed her bathing suit and slapped her buttocks. Flea allegedly demanded that she perform oral sex on him before both he and Smith were removed by security. After the arrest, the State University of New York at New Paltz canceled a Chili Peppers concert. Flea and Smith pled guilty to all charges. They were each sentenced to pay a $1,000 fine, plus $300 to the State Attorney's Office for prosecution costs and $5,000 to the Volusia County Rape Crisis Center, and ordered to write letters of apology to the woman. In a 1992 <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, Flea said: "I wish I'd never done it, and it was a really stupid thing to do. I was out of control. But I did not assault anybody, and it was not sexual. It had nothing to do with sex."
</p><p>In 2016, Julie Farman, a former music executive, alleged that two members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers pressed themselves against her and "told me about all of the ways we could make a super sexy sandwich" after a meeting with them at Epic Records in 1990.
