Shultz mentions in an interview with Billboard that Melophobia is not a fear of music, rather, "It's a fear of creating music under false pretenses, catering to cool, or writing to project some sort of image that's based upon social standards...[It's] trying to sound artistic, poetic or intellectual, rather than just trying to communicate an honest thought or feeling or story." "Take It or Leave It" and "Cigarette Daydreams" were released on March 24, 2014, and August 26, 2014, respectively. The band toured with Muse as an opening act in the fall of 2013.

Guitarist Nick Bockrath filled in as lead guitarist on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> on December 9 and, on subsequent shows. The <i>Melophobia</i> tour continued into 2014, including a stop at the Lollapalooza music festival on August 3.

Overall the album once again received positive reception from critics with Brian Mansfield of <i>USA Today</i> designated it "Album of the Week," summarizing that "<i>Melophobia</i> may mean 'fear of music,' but there's nothing to be afraid of: Its glorious chaos makes for thrilling listening.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Style_and_lyrical_themes">Style and lyrical themes</h2>
<p>During their early years the band was influenced by classic rock and folk bands such as The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles. But later on during the band's time in London, their exposure to bands such as Nirvana, Foals and Gang of Four helped shape their early alt rock and punk sound. Lead singer Matt Shultz cites bands such as the Pixies as influential on his vocal style.
</p><p>Throughout the band's tenure they have been known for their evolving sound and ability to fuse genres together. Starting out with their debut self titled album that had more of a garage rock sound. But with every new album that came out after the band has intentionally taken a different direction in sound and style. This was best seen in the band's 3rd studio album <i>Melophobia</i> in which the band moved beyond their usual garage rock and funky blues rock sound. They incorporated numerous sounds and instruments, which resulted in a more dark and mellow sound along with elements of psychedelic rock while still keeping some of the Blues style seen in their first two albums. Then with a strong vocal performance by Shultz it all came together to completely reinvent the band's sound. On top of this the band values immediacy where they often forego over polished production resulting in a more emotional impact. This was exemplified in the band's 4th studio album <i>Tell Me I'm Pretty</i> where they worked alongside Dan Auerbach, who pushed the band to embrace first takes and avoid overthinking.
</p><p>Some of the themes the band covered in their first two albums had to do with not selling out. The album <i>Thank You, Happy Birthday</i> made this point with tracks like "Sell Yourself" and "Shake Me Down". This attitude largely lent to the songs' poignant sound and connected them with an audience that is more concerned with principle than catchiness. Many of the band's songs especially from their more recent albums are rooted in experiences of the lead singer Matt Shultz. This is most prominently seen in their 5th studio album <i>Social Cues</i> which was written in the aftermath of his divorce. The album channeled Shultz's grief and emotional fragmentation into lyrics exploring identity, melancholy, isolation and disconnection. The death of close friends and family, including Matt and Brad's cousin and Brad's father-in-law, deeply influenced not only the lyrics but also the instrumentation of the record. Throughout the album they also critique the superficiality and pressures that come with fame, while also showing how it can lead to destructive behavior and distort one's perception of success. In the bands most recent album <i>Neon Pill</i> it touches upon mental health problems and addiction and resilience. Including Shultz's own personal battle of trying to find happiness while struggling with his metal health problems. Alongside his arrest.
</p><p>The band is also known to give energetic and entertaining live performances exemplified by frontman Matt Shultz's showmanship, with him dancing around the stage like Mick Jagger and diving into the crowd.
