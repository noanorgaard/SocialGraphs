<p>Vocalist Doug Robb had known guitarist Dan Estrin for some time before competing against him in a high school battle of the bands competition, and the two subsequently decided to form a band, later recruiting bassist Markku Lappalainen and drummer Chris Hesse.
</p><p>The band has provided a variety of explanations for the origin of their unusual name, and it remains unclear where it stems from. Claims have included that it is a mispronunciation of a German street, slang for someone who owns many sneakers, or a word the band came up with while they were "joking around".
</p><p>Hoobastank started playing at Cobalt Cafe in Los Angeles along with Incubus and Linkin Park. They recorded their first full-length, self-released album in 1998, called <i>They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To</i>, which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser (who also recorded the "Summer Romance" saxophone solo on Incubus' <i>S.C.I.E.N.C.E.</i>), who executive-produced the album.
</p><p>By this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from Island Records, who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the group had completed a second full-length album, titled <i>Forward</i>, also featuring Wasser. However, they felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the group, and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for Hoobastank's self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the <i>Forward</i> sessions made their way to the internet via peer-to-peer sites in late 2001.

<p>Hoobastank released their self-titled debut album in November 2001. The first single was "Crawling in the Dark", which was a breakthrough hit, reaching No. 68 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, No. 3 on the Modern Rock chart, and No. 7 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game <i>Aggressive Inline</i>, appearing on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube consoles. The second single, "Running Away", was even more successful, reaching No. 44 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, No. 2 on the Modern Rock chart, and No. 9 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No. 25 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album charts and No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> Heatseeker chart.
</p><p><i>Hoobastank</i> achieved recognition internationally, with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. "Remember Me", the third single, was a moderate hit, reaching No. 23 on the Modern Rock chart. The band also recorded a song titled "Losing My Grip" for the soundtrack of the 2002 movie <i>The Scorpion King</i>, which was included as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of the album, along with the song "The Critic".

<p>In early 2003, Hoobastank contributed the song "Right Before Your Eyes" to <i>Daredevil: The Album</i> and subsequently entered the studio with producer Howard Benson. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October, and the band headed off on the Nokia Unwired Tour with the All-American Rejects and Ozomatli in November.
</p><p>Their second album, <i>The Reason</i>, was released in December 2003 and eventually reached No. 3 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart.
</p><p>The first single, "Out of Control", was made available for download on their website. The next single, "Same Direction", reached No. 9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and No. 16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the DVD <i>Let It Out</i> collected the band's videos.
</p><p>The album's title track was released as a single in the first half of 2004 and became a hit, reaching No. 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, No. 1 on the US and World Modern Rock charts, No. 10 in Australia, No. 12 in the United Kingdom, and No. 15 in Germany. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No. 1.
</p><p>The band's international profile was increased by a support slot on Linkin Park's <i>Meteora</i> world tour in early 2004.
</p><p>Bassist Markku Lappalainen left Hoobastank following their 2005 Summer Tour, and Matt McKenzie from Tsunami Bomb took over for the remaining 2005 dates.

<p>Hoobastank's third album, <i>Every Man for Himself</i>, was released in May 2006 and debuted at No. 12 on the <i>Billboard</i> chart; it was eventually certified Gold in the US. Three singles, "If I Were You", "Inside of You", and "Born to Lead", were issued. Around this time, bassist Josh Moreau joined the band, replacing McKenzie.
</p><p>On a 2005 co-headlining tour with Velvet Revolver, Hoobastank received a chilly reception from some audiences, and rumors of a feud between Robb and Velvet Revolver frontman Scott Weiland soon filled internet message boards. The song "If I Were You" from <i>Every Man for Himself</i> addressed the affair. Robb later said in an interview with MTV News online that he had nothing against Weiland or any other member of Velvet Revolver.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Hoobastank have been categorized under genres such as post-grunge, alternative rock, hard rock, and nu metal. On their early independent releases, the band, which included a saxophonist, used a funk metal and ska punk sound. On their major-label, self-titled debut album, their sound changed: they removed their saxophonist and became a four-piece rock band, playing an alternative rock style. Hoobastank's sound matured on their second album, <i>The Reason</i>, and became more melodic. Singer Doug Robb has cited Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton as being one of his main influences. In a 2004 <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, Robb commented that, "Faith No More is my favorite band of all time. I listen to those records constantly."
