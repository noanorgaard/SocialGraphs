<p><b>Disturbed</b> is an American heavy metal band from Chicago, formed in 1994. The band includes guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, lead vocalist David Draiman and bassist John Moyer. Donegan and Wengren have been involved in the band since its inception, with Draiman replacing original lead vocalist Erich Awalt in 1996 and Moyer replacing original bassist Steve "Fuzz" Kmak in 2004.
</p><p>Disturbed's debut album, <i>The Sickness</i>, was released in 2000 as a commercial success, mainly due to the singles "Down With the Sickness" and "Stupify". The band then released the albums <i>Believe</i> (2002), <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i> (2005), <i>Indestructible</i> (2008), and <i>Asylum</i> (2010), all of which debuted at No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band's members focused on various side projects, and released <i>The Lost Children</i>, a compilation album containing previously unreleased songs. They returned in June 2015 and released their sixth album <i>Immortalized</i> that same year. They followed it up with the albums <i>Evolution</i> (2018) and <i>Divisive</i> (2022).
</p><p>With over 17 million records sold worldwide, six RIAA certifications for their albums (including 5× platinum for <i>The Sickness</i>), singles from all eight albums reaching the top ten of the Mainstream Rock chart, and two Grammy Award nominations, Disturbed ranks alongside Slipknot and Godsmack as one of the most successful rock bands of the 21st century.

<p>Before David Draiman joined Disturbed, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren and bassist Steve "Fuzz" Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to "Brawl", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, <i>Decade of Disturbed</i>, that the name was originally going to be "Crawl"; they switched it to "Brawl", because the name was already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the "Illinois Entertainer". Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: "You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that".
</p><p>With regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, "After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, "We clicked right off the bat." Draiman then joined the band in 1996, and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band "Disturbed", Draiman said, "It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense."

<p>After renaming the band, Disturbed went on to record two three-track demo tapes, the first containing demos for "The Game", "Down with the Sickness", and "Meaning of Life", while the second had demos for "Want", "Stupify", and "Droppin' Plates". The artwork was composed of the band's newly created mascot, The Guy. The band eventually signed with Giant Records in August 1999 and opened for Ministry at Chicago's Riviera Theatre around the same time. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled <i>The Sickness</i>, which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release. Before joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle, caused by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago. He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. Kmak skipped the European trek of the tour, but he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed's show in Chicago. During the European tour, Marty O'Brien replaced Kmak until he was able to tour again.

<p>In 2001, Disturbed covered the song "Midlife Crisis" for a Faith No More tribute album that was eventually abandoned. The cover was later rerecorded and released on the compilation album <i>The Lost Children</i> in 2011. In September 2001, production of their second studio album began. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled <i>M.O.L.</i>, which showed some of the band's more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances. On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled <i>Believe</i>, which debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The music video for the first single from the album, titled "Prayer", was pulled from most television stations, due to perceived similarities with the September 11, 2001 attacks. David Draiman recorded vocals for a song titled "Forsaken", a song written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn, released on <i>Queen of the Damned</i>.
</p><p>In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled <i>Music as a Weapon II</i>. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Ünloco toured with them. During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled "Dehumanized". After Disturbed finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of "personality differences". He was replaced by John Moyer; Moyer's last band, the Union Underground, had recently become inactive. On the night Moyer became the band's new bass player, Disturbed played live at the House of Blues and performed two new songs, "Hell" and "Monster", both of which are B-side tracks on the band's third studio album, <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i>.

<p>Disturbed's third studio album, <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i>, was released on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, while also selling around 238,000 copies in the week following its release. The album was certified platinum, shipping 1,000,000 units, in the United States on January 5, 2006. The band toured with 10 Years and Ill Niño in support of the album. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Lacuna Coil, DragonForce, Avenged Sevenfold, and Hatebreed.
</p>

<p>In an interview with Launch Radio Networks, Disturbed vocalist David Draiman stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing. The remaining songs included "Hell", which was included in one of the two "Stricken" singles; "Monster", which was included as an iTunes pre-order bonus for <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i>, then later included on the <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i> Tour Edition; "Two Worlds", which was also included on the Tour Edition of <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i>; and "Sickened", which was included in the "Land of Confusion" single. <i>Ten Thousand Fists</i> is the first album released by Disturbed to feature guitar solos. The band stated that they felt that guitar solos are a part of music that is absent in a lot of modern music, and they wanted to bring some of that back. Songs like "Stricken", "Overburdened", and "Land of Confusion" all feature guitar solos, as well as many others.
</p><p>In 2006, a European tour was scheduled but was rescheduled twice due to Draiman having troubles with severe acid reflux, which affected his voice, as related by Draiman himself. Later that year, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road. In late 2006, Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them. Disturbed completed the first leg of their Music as a Weapon III tour in late 2006. Soon after, Draiman stated that there was not going to be a second leg to the tour and that instead the band was going off the road to start working on their fourth studio album.

<p>In an interview in July 2009, with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the DVD would be "chronicling the past decade of Disturbed's existence. It's meant to show our growth over the course of the decade." He also talked more about the fifth album: "A couple of [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they're just little pieces...it's not even in two-three part progression [yet]." A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, <i>The Sickness</i>, with the B-side tracks "God of the Mind" and "A Welcome Burden", updated artwork, as well as remastering and remixing the track list. It was also available for the first time in vinyl format.

<p>Disturbed headlined the first annual "Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar" tour with Avenged Sevenfold, as well as Stone Sour, Hellyeah and Halestorm, among others in late summer 2010. Then, in October 2010, it was reported that David Draiman was diagnosed with a "serious throat condition", and the band's U.S. tour had been canceled, as Draiman's healing process could have taken up to four weeks. Around the end of that year, Disturbed announced that they would be commencing the Music as a Weapon V tour in 2011, co-headlining with Korn and guests Sevendust, In This Moment and Stillwell. In January 2011, the Mayhem Festival announced that Disturbed would be headlining the festival along with Godsmack and Megadeth that summer. In February 2011, Disturbed was added to that summer's Download Festival. Disturbed announced that in May 2011, they would be co-headlining the Rock on the Range Festival in Columbus, Ohio.

</p><p>In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011. Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled <i>The Lost Children</i>, on November 8, 2011. The song "Hell" was made available for digital download on October 11, 2011, but Draiman stated on his Twitter page that there would not be a music video for it.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Other_projects">Other projects</h2>
<p>On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer was supergroup Adrenaline Mob's new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City's Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band's debut full-length album, <i>Omertá</i>. On February 14, 2012, on his Twitter account David Draiman confirmed that he would make an appearance on VH1's <i>That Metal Show</i> 10th Season airing sometime that year.  That episode was later moved to the 11th season and premiered on August 11, 2012.
</p><p>In May 2012, Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman later released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device, stating that Device would release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style">Musical style</h3>
<p>Disturbed is mostly classified as heavy metal, hard rock and alternative metal, while their early sound has been described as nu metal. In 2006, when asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman stated:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>"We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>The secret is that we were never really part of any particular trend, although we definitely benefited from the popularity of what was called nu metal at the time ... We never had the stereotypical attributes that those bands had. We don't rap; there's no turntable involved; no fusion in that respect. We play, in my opinion, classic metal. Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Metallica, Pantera: these are the bands that made us want to play."</p></blockquote>
<p>Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album <i>Believe</i> as "taking the sort of jump that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records". He also described the title track as moving "from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding riff that recalls the work of vintage James Hetfield".
<i>Believe</i> is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the nu metal sound featured on <i>The Sickness</i>, moving towards a more hard rock and heavy metal sound that was continued in their following albums.
</p><p>Guitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings drop C, drop C#, and drop B (also occasionally E♭ standard), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as "The Danny Donegan Orchestra".

<p>According to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary <i>M.O.L.</i>, the lyrics that he writes are inspired by actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.
These lyrical themes range from the Judeo-Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, domestic abuse, suicide, insanity, relationships, war, to more fantastical themes, such as vampirism, werewolves and demons. Many of the band's post-hiatus releases have featured political lyrics.

<p>Disturbed's mascot, named "The Guy", was originally a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album <i>The Sickness</i>. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times, The Guy became the band's official mascot. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch.
