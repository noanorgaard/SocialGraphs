<p><b>311</b> (pronounced "three eleven") is an American rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson, bassist Aaron "P-Nut" Wills, and drummer Chad Sexton. Watson was replaced by Tim Mahoney in 1990.  In 1992, Doug "SA" Martinez joined as a second vocalist and turntablist.
</p><p>311 has released fourteen studio albums, two live albums, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums <i>Music</i> (1993) and <i>Grassroots</i> (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album, which reached number 12 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 on the strength of the singles "Down" and "All Mixed Up", the former of which topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996. The band's next three albums—<i>Transistor</i> (1997), <i>Soundsystem</i> (1999), and <i>From Chaos</i> (2001)—were also successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold. Their 2004 compilation album <i>Greatest Hits '93–'03</i> was also certified platinum. The band's latest studio album is 2024's <i>Full Bloom</i>. By 2022, 311 had sold over 10 million records in the United States.
</p><p>The band's name was chosen by Wills from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha after a friend of the band was arrested and cited for skinny dipping in a public pool.

<p>311's first independent release was the <i>Downstairs</i> EP, which was recorded in 1989 in Nick Hexum's basement. Unlike many of their releases, it had no cover art. It features the song "Feels So Good," which was recreated/remastered in the album <i>Music</i> and is a staple of most of 311's live shows.
</p><p>In 1990, 311 produced 300 cassettes of their second independent release, <i>Dammit!</i>, recorded at IEV Studios in Papillion, Nebraska.
</p><p>In 1991, Tim Mahoney replaced Jim Watson on guitar and 311 released their third independent release, <i>Unity</i>, recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios in Omaha. 1000 CDs and 500 cassettes of Unity were printed; they were distributed through consignment and sold at shows. The band began to headline shows in local clubs, such as the Ranch Bowl and Sokol Auditorium.
</p><p>In 1992, Doug "SA" Martinez, whose nickname stands for Spooky Apparition and who had been making various appearances with 311 over the past years as a vocalist, was officially asked to join the band. 311 recorded a six-track demo, called <i>Hydroponic</i>, also recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios, and moved to Los Angeles. Within their first few months, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records.

<p>Their first major record, <i>Music</i>, was released in 1993. The single "Do You Right" received airplay on modern rock stations and reached No. 27 on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, the album failed to chart at the time. The album was produced by Eddy Offord, who famously produced Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.
</p><p>Financing their own tour, the band drove around in an old RV borrowed from Sexton's father and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door out of the vehicle was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire. All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour using borrowed equipment.
</p><p>The following year, they released their second studio album, <i>Grassroots</i>.

<p>In 1995, 311 released the self-titled <i>311</i> (colloquially known as "The Blue Album"). Produced by Ron St. Germain, the album was recorded live in contrast to their previous two albums in which all instruments were recorded separately. The first single "Don't Stay Home" was a modest success, reaching No. 29 on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Modern Rock Tracks chart. But the follow-up single "Down", which was released 14 months after the album, received heavy airplay on mainstream radio, and the accompanying music video was on MTV's rotation. The song hit No. 1 on the Modern Rock chart. The band made their network television debut on <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</i> on August 23, 1995. The third single, "All Mixed Up", enjoyed almost identical success, reaching No. 4 on the Modern Rock chart. They also appeared on <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i> playing "Down".
</p><p>In the following years, 311 continued touring and on August 5, 1997, they released <i>Transistor,</i> which debuted at No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, their highest position on that chart. The album went platinum.

</p><p>Since 2000, the band has recorded every album at the Hive, a North Hollywood, California, recording studio they purchased in 1995. The sessions for <i>From Chaos</i>, 311's sixth major record release, were the first to be held there. <i>From Chaos</i> was released in late 2001.

</p><p>On June 7, 2024, 311 premiered the music video for "You're Gonna Get It", their first new single since 2019. The music video, directed by Brian Bowen Smith, sees Hexum as a bare-knuckle pugilist fighting in an underground arena, reminiscent of the 1999 David Fincher film, Fight Club. Hexum said of the track: "The story behind the lyrics to 'You're Gonna Get It' is going back into the mindset of when we were young, and dumb and doing a lot of crazy stuff. Sometimes getting away with it, sometimes with consequences. And I'm going in and out of the first person saying to myself, 'get your stuff together! Or else you're gonna get it.'"
</p><p>On September 18, 2024, 311 announced the release of their 14th studio album, <i>Full Bloom</i>, along with its second single, "Need Somebody". The album was released on October 25, 2024. The band took to Instagram, describing the album as "311 on steroids."

<h2 data-mw-anchor="311_Day">311 Day</h2>
<p>On March 11, 2000, 311 began celebrating an unofficial holiday of their own creation called 311 Day. The band chose the date because March 11 is written in the United States as 3/11.

</p><p>In recent years, 311 Day has been split across two or three days. The 2021 event was held as a livestream, due to COVID-19-related restrictions in effect at the time, and consisted only of the band performing the <i>Transistor</i> album in full, while the 2023 event was their first to take place aboard a cruise.
