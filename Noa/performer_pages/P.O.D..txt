<p>In 1991 as a precursor to P.O.D., Sonny Sandoval fronted a rap/hip-hop group called Unlicensed Product, while Wuv Bernardo, Marcos Curiel and Gabe Portillo were in a thrash metal band called Eschatos, with no vocalist.  In 1992, Eschatos recruited Sandoval on vocals, which Bernardo believed would help him with his mother's recent death to Leukemia.  They renamed the group to Payable on Death, a banking-term pitched by Bernardo's girlfriend who worked in a bank at the time.  The name was later shortened to P.O.D.  They recorded their first song that year, "Three In the Power of One", which was later included on their debut studio album <i>Snuff the Punk</i>.

<p>After recording a demo tape, Traa Daniels joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Portillo. P.O.D. signed with Rescue Records, a label created by Bernardo's father, Noah Bernardo Sr., who was also the band's first manager. Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, <i>Snuff the Punk</i>, <i>Brown</i> and <i>Payable on Death Live</i>. Longtime manager Tim Cook was first introduced to the band when he booked them to play his club The Where-House in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, following strong local word of mouth support. He later described their performance by saying: "I stood at the back of the venue with tears in my eyes – it was the greatest thing I had ever seen." By that point, Bernardo Sr. was looking for someone else to take P.O.D.'s career further and so Cook took over as manager.
</p><p>Shortly after the release of <i>Payable on Death Live</i>, Essential Records offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but on behalf of the band Sandoval told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, "God has a bigger plan for P.O.D." When, in 1998, Atlantic Records A&amp;R John Rubeli first came across P.O.D.'s demo he "didn't quite get it", as he later told HitQuarters. It was only when he saw them play live at The Roxy on the Sunset Strip. The band was quickly signed to a major-label deal. P.O.D. soon released <i>The Warriors EP</i>, a tribute EP to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.

<p>P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's <i>The Fundamental Elements of Southtown</i>, spawned the hits "Southtown" and "Rock the Party (Off the Hook)", which was their first video to reach No. 1 on MTV's <i>Total Request Live</i>. The song "School of Hard Knocks" was featured on the soundtrack for <i>Little Nicky</i> while both "Southtown" and "Rock the Party" appeared in the movie. All three music videos enjoyed heavy play on MTV2, and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become RIAA certified platinum.
</p><p>On September 11, 2001, P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, <i>Satellite</i>. The album's first single, "Alive", went on to become one of MTV's and MTV2's top played videos of the year. The video's popularity, as well as the song's positive message, helped the song become a huge modern rock radio hit, and it was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2002. Also in 2002, the band contributed the song "America" to Santana's album <i>Shaman</i>.
</p><p>The album's second single, "Youth of the Nation", was influenced in part by the school shootings at Santana High School, Columbine High School, and Granite Hills High School. It was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2003. The 2002 singles, "Boom" and "Satellite", also became quite popular. In addition, the concluding track of the album, "Portrait," was Grammy nominated for Best Metal Performance in 2003. “Boom” was used in, and part of its lyrics the title of, the comedy film <i>Here Comes the Boom</i>, starring Kevin James.
</p><p><i>Satellite</i> went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum. The author of <i>Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music</i> has described P.O.D. as "One of the biggest success stories in recent Christian music."

<p>On February 19, 2003, guitarist Curiel left the band due to his side project, <i>The Accident Experiment</i>, and "spiritual differences." However, Curiel claimed that he was actually kicked out of the band. Curiel was replaced by Jason Truby, former member of Christian metal band Living Sacrifice, and assisted with the recording of  "Sleeping Awake", from <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> soundtrack. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Sandoval stated that Truby is the reason why the group is still together. On November 4, 2003, P.O.D. released their fifth studio album, <i>Payable on Death</i>, which saw the group shift from their well-known rapcore sound to a darker, more melodic metal sound. The album was hit with controversy due to its "occult" cover, which led as many as 85% of Christian bookstores across the United States to ban the album. With the help of the album's hit single "Will You" and "Change the World", it went on to sell over 520,000 copies and was certified Gold. 
</p><p>P.O.D.'s sixth studio album, <i>Testify</i>, was slated for a December 2005 release, but was pushed back to January 24, 2006. On November 15, 2005, P.O.D. released <i>The Warriors EP, Volume 2</i>, which featured demos from the upcoming album, to help build up the fans' anticipation for the pending January release. The album's first single, "Goodbye for Now" (with a vocal tag by a then-unknown Katy Perry) went on to become a No. 1 video on MTV's <i>TRL</i>; along with having a solid radio presence, it also became the band's unprecedented 4th number one video on Total Request Live. The second single off the album, "Lights Out" was a minor hit, but was featured as the official theme song to WWE's Survivor Series 2005. In another contribution to WWE, they performed fellow San Diego native Rey Mysterio's theme song "Booyaka 619" at <i>WrestleMania 22</i>. To promote their latest album, P.O.D. went on a nationwide tour called the "Warriors Tour 2: Guilty by Association", which began in April, and included the bands Pillar, The Chariot and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster.

<p>The band headlined the first annual Spring Jam Fest in May 2011. They appeared on the Rock of Allegiance tour later that summer. On July 25, 2011, the band released a demo of the song "On Fire" as a free download on their official website.
</p><p>In October 2011, P.O.D. announced a multi-album artist deal with Razor &amp; Tie. On April 5, 2012, the song  "Eyez" became a free download on the band's website for a limited time. Shortly after, an article on their website stated that "Lost in Forever" would be the first single from the new album, entitled <i>Murdered Love</i>.
</p><p><i>Murdered Love</i> was originally going to be released in June 2012, but was instead pushed back to July 10. The album was produced by Howard Benson, who also produced <i>Satellite</i> and <i>The Fundamental Elements of Southtown</i>. It was described by Curiel as "Back to our roots. A little bit of hip hop, a little bit of punk rock, or reggae". The album caused controversy concerning its eleventh track, "I Am", which uses the word "fuck" (albeit backmasked). Sandoval, explaining the purpose of the song, said:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>"I'm a man of faith and I'm a follower and a believer of Jesus Christ, and in talking to these kids, and even in talking to people just throughout my career in P.O.D., a lot of these bands and athletes and all these people that you meet, they don't have a problem with Jesus. They have a problem with people that are religious and claim to know Jesus, but aren't living it or acting it and aren't loving the way Jesus did. [...] We had that song for almost a year, and I didn't take it lightly. I'd been praying on it for over a year. I'd actually took counsel and let people hear it. And it was 50/50. Some people are like, you know what, go for it. Because my heart is like, I don't write music for Christians. I don't write music for people that I believe are saved and going to heaven. [...] Ultimately we're trying to reach people fed up with religion that are sick and tired of it, and people that are in the real world that really are lost and confused."</p></blockquote><p> 
</p><p>The band went on tour with Shinedown and Three Days Grace as an opening act.
</p><p>In a 2012 interview with <i>Broken Records Magazine</i>, Sandoval said that the band had to get their lives back in order and take care of personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely happy about the response the band was getting from fans.
</p><p>On October 22, 2013, P.O.D. released a deluxe edition of <i>Murdered Love</i>. The album contains the original songs, slightly remixed, along with bonus tracks "Find a Way", "Burn It Down", acoustic versions of "Beautiful" and "West Coast Rock Steady", a remixed version of "On Fire", and music videos for "Murdered Love", "Beautiful", "Higher", and "Lost In Forever". Multiple behind the scenes videos were also on the track list.

Being on tour for thirty years starts to take a toll on anybody in different ways...For me it was obvious that it was that time for me to take a break from the traveling and doing the whole circus over and over again. I don't think I was built to do it any longer at the time...Love the guys, always gonna love the band. I started the band in my garage. It's a part of my life, it's a part of my family, it's a part of all the love that I got. I'm always gonna be center, right there with the guys, knowing what's going on and everything like that. Whenever God wants me to come back, then that's what's up for me. That's where I'm at right now."

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>The band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the banking term "Payable on Death". The band chose this name to be a direct tie in with the Christian theology that explains that since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians' debts to God have been paid; in other words all believers, in their acceptance that Jesus was sacrificed for them on God's behalf, have inherited eternal life. P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the rap metal sound on their early albums to the nu metal and reggae-infused alternative metal styles for which they're most well known. The band's seventh album, <i>When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance</i>, is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include Boogie Down Productions, Run-DMC, U2, the Police, Bad Brains, Santana, Metallica, AC/DC, Suicidal Tendencies, Bob Marley, Primus, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, 24-7 Spyz, and Steel Pulse.
