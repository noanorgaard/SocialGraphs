<p>Trevor McNevan formed the band in his hometown of Peterborough, Ontario, a city northeast of Toronto, with his childhood friend Joel Bruyere and drummer Steve Augustine. McNevan's first band was <span>Oddball</span>, and featured Dave Smith on guitar, Tim Baxter on bass and McNevan's good friend, Three Days Grace's Neil Sanderson, on drums. Oddball recorded only one album, <i>Shutterbug</i>, which was released in 1995. The band's name was conceived by McNevan "symbolizing the point in our lives that we realize we can't make it on our own strength". He has written and released seven albums with Thousand Foot Krutch to date and another four with his side project FM Static.
</p><p><i>Shutterbug</i> was released by Trevor McNevan in 1995 under the band name Oddball. McNevan had friends Dave Smith (guitar), Tim Baxter (bass) and Neil Sanderson (drums), play on the album. There were 27 songs on the album, the first half rock, the second half hip-hop. McNevan recorded it at Barry Haggarty's studio in his home town of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. He worked at McDonald's and other jobs to pay for the studio time. The song "Lift It" first appeared here and was later re-recorded for Thousand Foot Krutch's first release, <i>That's What People Do</i>, and appeared again on <i>Set It Off</i>.
</p><p><i>That's What People Do</i> was written the year McNevan started TFK in 1997. It was released independently in 1998 and is out of print. It sold over 5,000 copies. TFK climbed the ladder of local notoriety throughout Ontario and abroad. Reaching the ears of Ontario commercial radio, CKWF 101.5 FM in their home town of Peterborough added "Rhyme Animal", the band's first single from their independent recording, to their rotation. It clicked with listeners and within two months ended up being one of the five most requested songs of the year.
</p><p>In 1999, TFK was chosen by <i>7 Ball Magazine</i> as one of the top 25 bands in North America. They were also awarded "Best Indie Recording" and McNevan awarded "Vocalist of the Year" by the readers of <i>The Wire Magazine</i>. They were then awarded "Band of the Year" at the 2000 Wire Awards. They were also voted as the No. 1 band of the millennium on 100.3 FM in Barrie, Ontario.
</p><p><i>Set It Off</i> was released on November 14, 2000. It was the group's first indie label release. Though the sound of the album was distinct in its heavily hip-hop influenced nu metal, a few songs from the record (including "Puppet" and "Supafly") impacted at both secular and Christian radio. The band toured it extensively across North America and ended up garnering much label attention by selling 85,000 copies of the indie release out of their van. The band also printed a limited edition, "pre-release" version of <i>Set It Off</i> sold only at their release party at The Gordon Best Theatre in Peterborough, Ontario for their local fans. TFK toured with Finger Eleven, Econoline Crush, Treble Charger, the Tea Party, Matthew Good Band, Gob, Sum 41 and others. Three Days Grace, which was a cover band at that time, was TFK's regular support act. McNevan helped with recordings of Three Days Grace's demo album. He is also featured on their song "This Movie" from this album. Around this same time, Dave Smith left the group, making McNevan the only original member. Smith was replaced with Myke Harrison, who parted ways about a year later. After Dave Smith's departure, McNevan began writing all the guitar lines and the band has used a live guitar player instead of officially replacing him.
</p><p>Track seven from this album, "Unbelievable" – a cover of the EMF song of the same name – appeared on the soundtrack for the 2010 film <i>Just Wright</i>.

<p>In 2003, the band signed with Seattle-based Tooth &amp; Nail Records and released their second full-length album, <i>Phenomenon</i>. Though something of a departure from the rap-heavy sound of <i>Set it Off</i>, <i>Phenomenon</i> still relied on McNevan's rhythmic vocals, albeit with a solid modern hard rock sound. It was well received, and spawned four radio singles, including "Rawkfist". The album sold 200,000 units making it one of the best-selling albums in Tooth &amp; Nail's history. They continued this success with the 2004 re-release of <i>Set it Off</i> through Tooth &amp; Nail, allowing for a larger print run and adding six songs, including five from "That's What People Do", and one new song "Everyone Like Me", produced by Gavin Brown.
</p><p>At this time, McNevan and Augustine started a side band called FM Static, which differentiated from TFK with its pop-punk/pop-rock sound, with the overall tone being more lighthearted. FM Static scored numerous No. 1 songs, including their songs "Crazy Mary", and "Something to Believe In". In 2004, TFK toured with Kutless on the "Sea of Faces" tour alongside Falling Up and as FM Static.
</p><p>On July 19, 2005, they released their third full-length album <i>The Art of Breaking</i>, produced by Arnold Lanni. The album makes almost a complete break from the nu metal sound of <i>Phenomenon</i>, focusing more on heavy elements. It is the first album to feature short guitar solos. "Move" peaked at No. 16 on the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Rock chart early 2006. Other singles included "Absolute" and "Breathe You In", which was released to alternative radio and was one of the band's first slower songs. During this time the band toured extensively.
</p><p>In 2006, McNevan became involved with TobyMac and helped him write the song "Ignition" found on <i>Portable Sounds</i>. The song has been used in media placements including <i>Monday Night Football</i> and <i>NASCAR</i>. Because of this, in the early 2007, the band was part of the TobyMac Portable Sounds tour. The tour was such a success that Toby asked them to do the year-end tour as well.
</p><p>After working in the studio with producer Ken Andrews they released <i>The Flame in All of Us</i> on September 18, 2007, with a move to a more mainstream rock sound, with some heavy influences from bands such as fellow Canadian artists Our Lady Peace and other metal bands of the time. The album includes the singles "Falls Apart", "What do we Know?", "Favorite Disease" and "The Flame in All of Us". On January 20, 2008, "The Flame in All of Us" became the 1000th song to make it on the ChristianRock.Net Top 30 Chart. The next tour was in early 2008 with Skillet and Decyfer Down. After a lengthy summer playing festivals and one-offs, they were included in the first Creation Festival: The Tour that consisted of nine bands: Kutless, Pillar, KJ-52, Fireflight, Worth Dying For, Run Kid Run, Esterlyn, Capital Lights and themselves. They were asked to headline three tour dates, but declined. They also recorded the Christmas song "Jingle Bell Rawk" for the <i>X Christmas</i> compilation Christmas album, compiled by Tooth &amp; Nail Records.
For <i>Welcome to the Masquerade</i>, the band reunited with Aaron Sprinkle to co-produce this album, with Emery's Matt Carter assisting and Randy Staub mixing. The song "Fire It Up" was included in video games such as EA Sports <i>NHL 10</i>, and in the <i>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</i> film trailer. The album was released on September 8, 2009 and peaked at No. 35 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In mid-2009, McNevan underwent emergency surgery on his appendix, causing the band to cancel at Creation West Festival. He returned to play shows a week later. The band appeared at other festivals that year, including their debut appearance at Soulfest. They announced a year-end tour to support the new album. They also appeared on Creation Festival: The Tour again, this time with Jars of Clay, Audio Unplugged, B.Reith, FM Static and This Beautiful Republic. They were later involved with a Christmas holiday show with Thirty Seconds to Mars, Flyleaf, After Midnight Project and The Veer Union. On September 8, 2009, TFK's three albums, <i>Phenomenon</i>, <i>The Art of Breaking</i>, and <i>The Flame in All of Us</i> were re-released as a three-CD set: <i>Deja Vu: The Thousand Foot Krutch Anthology</i>. They toured with Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle and Red in March 2010.

On April 19, The Detroit Red Wings used "The Invitation" and "Welcome to the Masquerade" during the pre-game introduction. On May 11, 2010, McNevan announced on his personal Facebook page: "We [TFK] covered "The Heat Miser Song" from the old classic Christmas special, gonna do one with FM too, but that's a surprise..." referring to their upcoming appearance on the album <i>X-Christmas 2</i> by Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Transition_to_Teerawk_and_indefinite_disbandment">Transition to Teerawk and indefinite disbandment</h3>
<p>In August 2025, band frontman Trevor McNevan shared on the <i>Joel Martin Mastery Podcast</i> that under his stage name Teerawk, he is working on a new album called <i>The Sound of Awakening</i>. The album will feature McNevan singing about various situations in his personal life, with vocals having been recorded during those moments. Originally developed as a personal project, McNevan decided to transform it into a public solo project:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>[The album turned into] what would [have effectively been] the new TFK record—same songwriter, voice, and guitarist.<span> </span>... It's a very personal record.<span> </span>... In my heart, it didn't feel right about trying to release it as TFK. I know on a business level that [it obviously doesn't make] a ton of sense, but [releasing under TFK] wasn't what felt right to me. From now on, all the music that I release is going to be released under Teerawk.</p></blockquote>
<p>On September 9, 2025, Thousand Foot Krutch posted to their Facebook page official confirmation regarding indefinite disbandment, clarifying that "right now, as Thousand Foot Krutch, we don’t have any plans for new TFK music."
