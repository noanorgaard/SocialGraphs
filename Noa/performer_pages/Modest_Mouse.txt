<p><b>Modest Mouse</b> is an American rock band formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, and currently based in Portland, Oregon. The founding members were lead singer/guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy. They achieved critical acclaim for their albums <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> (1997) and <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> (2000) and found mainstream success with the release of <i>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</i> (2004) and its singles "Float On" and "Ocean Breathes Salty".
</p><p>From their 1996 debut album <i>This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About</i> onwards, the band's lineup mostly centered on Brock and Green, undergoing multiple changes. As of 2024, Brock is the only original member of the band, Green having died in December 2022. Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. Guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) joined the band in 2006, shortly following percussionist Joe Plummer (formerly of the Black Heart Procession) and multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, to work on the album <i>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</i> (2007). Guitarist Jim Fairchild joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album, <i>Strangers to Ourselves</i>, was released in 2015 and their seventh, <i>The Golden Casket</i>, in 2021.

<p>When Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle, where he met bassist Eric Judy. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer Jeremiah Green, who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show, at which point they decided to make music together. Brock says he made a point of the band being from Issaquah to avoid association with the music scenes of Seattle or Olympia and to keep with the band's suburban lyrical themes. In 1994, at Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first EP, <i>Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?</i>, which was released by K Records. This was followed by a single, "Broke", recorded by Steve Wold (<abbr title="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr> bluesman Seasick Steve) under Sub Pop records at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i>, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues such as Speak in Tongues in Cleveland, Ohio, where they continued to play even after becoming popular enough to fill larger venues.
</p><p>After moving to Up Records, Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings including the 1996 LP <i>This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About</i>. Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, <i>Interstate 8</i>. The 1997 album, <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP <i>The Fruit That Ate Itself</i>. In 2000, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled <i>Building Nothing Out of Something</i> that included the entirety of <i>Interstate 8</i> except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons".

<p>In 2000, Modest Mouse released <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, its first album on Epic Records. The album, produced by Califone's Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago, was met with critical acclaim, including a 9.8/10 score from online music magazine Pitchfork Media, despite concerns about releasing material on a major label. The album would later receive further acclaim.
</p><p>The band licensed "Gravity Rides Everything" for a Nissan Quest minivan advertisement, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability. Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, "People who don't have to make their living playing music can bitch about my principles while they spend their parents' money or wash dishes for some asshole."
</p><p>In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP <i>Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks</i>, a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>. In 2002, the band joined Cake, De La Soul, The Flaming Lips, The Hackensaw Boys and Kinky on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour.

<p>In March 2003, Green left the band after suffering a nervous breakdown; official reports stated he was leaving to work with his side project, Vells. The same year, he and Judy appeared on Adam Forkner's first solo album, <i>VVRSSNN</i>. Drummer Benjamin Weikel joined the band, replacing Green, along with Murder City Devils guitarist Dann Gallucci, who had previously played with Modest Mouse. Prior to starting the band's writing and recording process, Brock was devastated by the loss of "a couple of the most important people in my life", he said. Following these events, the band released their fourth album, <i>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</i>, on April 6, 2004. The following August, the album was certified Platinum, having two hits with "Float On" and "Ocean Breathes Salty" (both of which they performed on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> on November 13, 2004). The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album that year, and "Float On" was nominated for Best Rock Song. Green rejoined the band in May 2004, while Weikel returned to drumming exclusively for the Helio Sequence. The public radio program <i>Marketplace</i> used "Float On" as bumper music, which helped propel the group to a broader audience.
</p><p>In 2006, Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) joined the band after Gallucci quit amicably. Modest Mouse released their next album, <i>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</i>, on March 20, 2007 after its original release date of December 19, 2006 was delayed. The album also included bonus track and single "King Rat", which actor Heath Ledger had known about before the track was released; the band was formally introduced to the actor while on their 2007 tour in Australia. Ledger proposed an outline for a music video to the group, and with his film collective, the Masses, immediately began working on it once he had the band's approval. Upon Ledger's death in January 2008, the video went unfinished.

Writing for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, music critic Mark Richardson gave a mixed review of the album. Richardson described the tracks on the first half of the album as "sound[ing] like busy arrangements in search of a song", and noted that "Mr. Brock's ear for hooks just barely rescues the tracks from the seriously overstuffed production." Richardson noted that the back half of the album contained the biggest highlights, which he described as "quite good". Richardson was particularly fond of the album's stripped-down finale, "Back to the Middle", which he noted "hints at what should be [the band's] next change-up: Keep it simple. If the songs are strong and the performances are there, guitar, bass and drums will be more than enough.
</p><p>In an interview in 2022, celebrating 15 years of <i>We Were Dead before The Ship Even Sank</i>, Isaac Brock and Johnny Marr revealed that they were writing songs together again, the first of which is called "Rivers of Rivers". The writing took place in a "pen pal" kind of way, with Brock saying that there were more songs to be developed in 2022 together "once the world tilts back on its axis".
</p><p>In July 2022 the band was mixing a nine-song companion EP to <i>The Golden Casket</i>, with Marr confirmed to appear on one of the tracks.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_lyrics">Musical style and lyrics</h2>
<p>Marcy Donelson of AllMusic called Modest Mouse's sound "a volatile mix of punk-inspired rawness and simmering atmosphere" showing tendencies of "light-hearted pop". The band's early releases were said to be a mix of emo, post-rock, folk and progressive music. The early releases were also noted for their abrasiveness and sense of experimentation. Jim Alexander of <i>NME</i> wrote in a contemporary review of <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i>: "Modest Mouse are the sound of the Pacific Northwest - this is music as rugged as the area it comes from." The band's later output contained pop sensibilities.
</p><p>Frontman Isaac Brock's lyrical themes tend to explore topics such as small town life and religion. In 2016, a study conducted by music data company Musixmatch surveyed 43,414 songs spanning multiple genres found that Modest Mouse was one of the most profane bands among the subjects categorized as "indie rock," second only to The Neighborhood. It was estimated that the band used profanity every 310 words, and that the top three swear words uttered by the band were "shit," "fuck" and "ass," respectively.
