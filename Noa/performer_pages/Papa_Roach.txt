<p>Papa Roach's formation began in January 1993 when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School, rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther, and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a rendition of Jimi Hendrix's song "Fire". Ultimately, they did not win the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, followed by Anne Mikolajcik. During this period, Papa Roach practiced daily and toured extensively, playing every gig they could secure. The band's first tour van was named Moby Dick, which inspired Shaddix to adopt his initial stage name, "Coby Dick." Initially, the band was called "Papa Gato," as suggested by Buckner, but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, combining the nickname of his maternal grandfather, Herbert Fischer "Papa," with "Roach," derived from his paternal grandfather, John "Grandpa" Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.
</p><p>In 1994, Papa Roach released its first EP, titled <i>Potatoes for Christmas</i>. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown while he spent the year in Seattle, studying art. In 1995, the band released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled <i>Caca Bonita</i>. By this time, Buckner had returned. In 1996, the group replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp limited the band's summer rehearsals and touring.

<p>On February 4, 1997, the band's debut studio album, titled <i>Old Friends from Young Years</i>, was released. At this time, the group was actively touring, supporting bands such as Incubus, Powerman 5000, Hed PE, Snot, Far, and Static-X.
</p><p>In 1998, Papa Roach released an EP titled <i>5 Tracks Deep</i>, which sold more than 1,000 copies within its first month of release. In 1999, the band produced another EP, their final independent release, titled <i>Let 'Em Know</i>. Its success attracted the attention of Warner Music Group, which, as part of a development deal, provided a modest amount of funding for the production of a five-track promotional demo CD. The band sought out influential rock producer Jay Baumgardner to produce the record. In an interview with HitQuarters, Baumgardner stated, "At first, I wasn't really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club – I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart – and that's when I realized that they definitely had potential."
</p><p>Warner Bros. was unimpressed with the demo and chose not to sign the group. The unreleased disc included the tracks "Infest," "Last Resort," "Broken Home," "Dead Cell," and "She Loves Me Not".
</p><p>Shortly thereafter, DreamWorks Records offered the band a recording contract.

<p>After signing with DreamWorks Records in October 1999, Papa Roach promptly entered the studio to record their major-label debut album, titled <i>Infest</i>. The album featured songs from their earlier independent releases, including "Infest," "Last Resort," "Broken Home," and "Dead Cell" from the Warner Bros. demo CD; "Revenge In Japanese" as "Revenge" and "Thrown Away" from their <i>5 Tracks Deep</i> EP; and "Legacy," "Binge," "Snakes," and a softer version of the originally heavier "Tightrope" from the <i>Let 'Em Know</i> EP. These tracks were re-recorded, along with three additional newly written songs: "Obsession" (later known as "Between Angels and Insects"), "Blood Brothers," and "Never Enough." <i>Infest</i> was released on April 25, 2000, and sold 30,001 copies in its first week.
</p><p>With the release of their second album and the recording of the music video for "Last Resort," Papa Roach embarked on the Vans Warped Tour and several other major tours, including the Anger Management Tour alongside Limp Bizkit and rap acts such as Eminem, Xzibit, D12, Ludacris, and X-Ecutioners. In 2000, they launched their headlining "Master Bay" tour, supported by Linkin Park and Hed PE. The band received a nomination for "Best New Artist in a Video" at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards for "Last Resort."
</p><p>In late 2000, the band toured the United Kingdom, demonstrating the rapid expansion of their global popularity. On Saint Patrick's Day in 2001, Papa Roach began the "Raid The Nation" tour in the U.S, which included Alien Ant Farm and Orgy as opening acts. During that year, the band also participated in Ozzfest, where they performed on the prestigious main stage during both the United States and United Kingdom tours. The song "Blood Brothers" was also featured in the popular video game <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</i>.
</p><p>After touring worldwide, the band returned to the studio to record their third album, initially titled <i>Born to Rock</i>, but later renamed <i>Lovehatetragedy</i>. The album was released in the United States on June 18, 2002. Although it did not outsell <i>Infest</i>, it achieved higher chart positions in both the United States and United Kingdom album charts. The album has sold over 500,000 copies and has been certified gold. The album featured a greater emphasis on singing rather than rapping, while the band retained their nu metal sound. It produced two singles: "She Loves Me Not" and "Time and Time Again", both of which included elements of rapping along with the rap metal sound characteristic of <i>Infest</i>. The music video for "Time and Time Again" was featured in a Pepsi Blue commercial. That same year, the band embarked on a tour to support <i>Lovehatetragedy</i>, which included performances on the second Anger Management Tour. This tour was co-headlined by Eminem and Papa Roach, alongside Ludacris, Xzibit, X-Ecutioners, and Bionic Jive.  
</p>
  
<p>In late 2003, Papa Roach wrote and recorded their third album, initially titled <i>Dancing In the Ashes</i>, which was released as <i>Getting Away with Murder</i>. The band collaborated with well-known producer Howard Benson. After completing the album, the band filmed a music video for the title track, "Getting Away with Murder", and went on a brief summer club tour to prepare for the subsequent tours. The album marked a departure for the band, as it was their first album not to incorporate the nu metal style of their previous works. Additionally, it was the band's first album that did not feature rapping. <i>Getting Away with Murder</i> outsold <i>Lovehatetragedy</i>, primarily due to the success of the album's second single, "Scars". To date, the album has sold over one million copies and has been certified Platinum. On November 9, 2004, the band released their fifth EP, <i>Rolling Stone Original</i>, an EP that was only available digitally. On November 22, 2005, they released their first live album, <i>Papa Roach: Live &amp; Murderous in Chicago</i>.
</p><p>In 2005, the band spent a significant amount of time on tour, which included a full United States and European tour alongside bands such as Dead Poetic, Trust Company, Chronic Future, Skindred, 311, and Unwritten Law.

<p>On September 12, 2006, Papa Roach released their fourth album, <i>The Paramour Sessions</i>. The band named the album after the recording location, the Paramour Mansion. The idea for an album recorded in a mansion emerged while the band was working on <i>Getting Away with Murder</i>. "...To Be Loved" was the first single released from the album and served as the official theme song for <i>WWE Raw</i> from 2006 to 2009. The album debuted at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart.
</p><p>The band began touring in support of the album in August 2006, starting with an American tour followed by a European leg.

</p><p>On October 10, 2006, a String Quartet tribute album titled <i>Perfect Murder: Strung Out on Papa Roach</i> was released by Vitamin Records.
</p><p>The band initially planned to release a compilation of acoustic recordings of their songs, including "Forever," "Scars," and "Not Coming Home," which was recorded for KROQ-FM's charity Christmas album, <i>Kevin and Bean's Super Christmas</i>. However, the acoustic compilation was later shelved. In an interview with Billboard, Shaddix expressed his belief that fans were not yet ready for an acoustic direction from the band.
</p><p>On April 25, 2007, it was announced that drummer Dave Buckner would be sitting out the band's touring schedule due to personal matters, with expectations for him to rejoin the group shortly thereafter. Shaddix later confirmed in an interview with Launch Radio Networks that Dave had entered rehab to "go clean his act up 'cause he was out of his mind." Unwritten Law drummer Tony Palermo filled in on drums.
</p><p>In the summer of 2007, the band went on the Bad Boys of Rock tour, supporting Hinder. During this tour, frontman Shaddix and Hinder lead singer Austin Winkler developed a strong friendship, leading to the band touring with Hinder on multiple occasions in subsequent years. It was revealed in 2015 that Shaddix and Austin wrote and recorded a song together for part of Winkler's solo project, although both expressed uncertainty about whether the song would ever be released.
</p><p>In 2008, it was announced that the band would officially part ways with drummer Dave Buckner. It was also revealed that Buckner had sued the band, claiming he wasn't "receiving his fair share of the group's earnings."

We wanted to do something different [...] we'd always talked about doing a live record, and it turned into 'let's add a couple of bonus songs' [...] and now it's half live, half new songs and it's kind of the past and present of Papa Roach. I think it's a good representation and a good reminder of what this band's about, [...] and it gives you a look at where our sound can go."
</p><p>Starting April 25, 2011, Papa Roach headlined the Raid The Nation tour, with the first leg featuring Finger Eleven.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style,_influences,_and_legacy" data-mw-fallback-anchor="Musical_style.2C_influences.2C_and_legacy">Musical style, influences, and legacy</h2>
<p>Papa Roach has been described as alternative rock, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, rap rock, punk rock, pop rock, and rapcore. The band also incorporates elements of pop, electronic, and hip hop. 
</p><p>The band began as a hardcore punk group, and evolved towards nu metal and rap metal styles on their early independent releases, and on their first two major label albums, <i>Infest</i> and <i>Lovehatetragedy</i>. Before Papa Roach released their major label albums, Jacoby Shaddix's singing style was compared to Chino Moreno and Lynn Strait of Snot. Additionally, with their 2009 album, <i>Metamorphosis</i>, the band felt their music was undergoing a transformation to "stuff that's...harder and faster." AllMusic has compared the band's recent work to 1980s glam metal, while Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that "at the close of the 2000s, the quartet has shed the rap and the angst, ditching all the alt-metal accoutrements to become a knowing update of an '80s Sunset Strip sleaze rock outfit." With the release of <i>F.E.A.R.</i>, both MetalSucks and Metal Injection noted that the band had incorporated some djent influences.
</p><p>In 2004, frontman Jacoby Shaddix said the following in an interview with the Dallas Music Guide regarding the band no longer using rapping in their music: "...the rapping's gone! I don't feel like rapping. I'm just over that...I just want to be a rocker. It's what I wanted to be when I was a kid". Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: "We're a band that tries to walk that line between metal, hardcore, punk rock and pop music, and we do our best at trying to make it all cool".
</p><p>Prior to the release of <i>The Connection</i>, guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that "It's kind of a natural thing for us, we've always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting". He also said that the band was going to explore "electronic sounds for the next record".
</p><p>The band's influences include Faith No More, Social Distortion, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Refused, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix cites Faith No More's Mike Patton and Social Distortion's Mike Ness as significant influences, stating, "The way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but I appreciate the storytelling that Mike Ness does. I kind of fused those two influences together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing."
</p><p>Initially, Papa Roach's most significant influence was the experimental band Mr. Bungle, fronted by Mike Patton of Faith No More. This influence is evident in the adventurous nature of their 1994 debut release, <i>Potatoes for Christmas</i>.
</p><p>In a 2021 interview, Jacoby Shaddix reflected on the band's longstanding association with the nu metal genre, stating, "I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that's dope, but we've been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time."
</p><p>Papa Roach is regarded as one of the bands that helped define the nu metal sound. Alternative Press stated: "Despite distancing themselves from their distinctive sound in recent years, Papa Roach's early output shaped the aspect of nü metal that the mainstream embraced with open arms—riff-laden, radio-friendly (at least, after a few bleeps) singles with dark, earworm lyrics designed to upset parents. Jacoby Shaddix's in-your-face tones introduced many teenagers to their nü-metal awakening, supported by completely singable and seductive guitar lines that made this outfit so instrumental in the genre. So much so that a feature from Shaddix serves as a seal of approval for any album."
</p><p>Regarding the band's album "Infest," Kerrang! magazine remarked: "Straining vocal cords and detonating dancefloors with 'Last Resort,' tugging the heartstrings with 'Broken Home,' and embedding themselves under our skin with 'Between Angels And Insects,' Jacoby Shaddix's Californian group didn't just deliver an overload of angst—they unleashed every ounce of emotion through arguably the catchiest songwriting nu metal would ever see. Adolescence never truly ends, and even now, these are absolutely essential sounds."
