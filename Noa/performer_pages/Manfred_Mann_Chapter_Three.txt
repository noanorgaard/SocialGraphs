<p><b>Manfred Mann Chapter Three</b> were a British experimental jazz rock band founded by South African keyboard player Manfred Mann and long-time partner Mike Hugg, both former members of the group Manfred Mann. "Chapter III" was a reference to the earlier line-ups with singers Paul Jones followed by Mike D'Abo.
</p><p>The line-up for its debut at Newcastle's Mayfair Ballroom on 24 October 1969 was Mike Hugg (vocals/electric piano), Mann (organ), Bernie Living (alto sax), Steve York (bass) and Craig Collinge (drums), augmented by a five-piece brass section of Clive Stevens (tenor sax), Carl Griffiths (tenor sax), Dave Coxhill (baritone sax), Gerald Drewett (trombone) and Sonny Corbett (trumpet).
</p><p>The band released two studio albums but shelved a third. A tour of Australia and New Zealand in April and May 1971 with Deep Purple and Free was cut short after an altercation with the promoter. The band flew back to England two weeks early and broke up. Mann went on to form Manfred Mann's Earth Band later that year.
