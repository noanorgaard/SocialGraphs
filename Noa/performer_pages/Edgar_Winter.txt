<p>Winter composed and performed songs of numerous genres, including rock, jazz, blues, and pop. His critically acclaimed 1970 debut release, <i>Entrance</i>, was first to demonstrate his unique style of genre-blending musicianship. His early recording of "Tobacco Road" gained attention. Edgar followed <i>Entrance</i> with two hit albums backed by his group White Trash, a group originally composed of musicians from Texas and Louisiana. White Trash, with Winter and Jerry Lacroix both on lead vocals and sax, released the studio album <i>Edgar Winter's White Trash</i>, in 1971. It reached #111 on the charts, and 1972's follow-up album (partially recorded at New York's Apollo Theater) <i>Roadwork</i> achieved gold status.
</p><p>In late 1972, Winter brought together Dan Hartman, Ronnie Montrose and Chuck Ruff to form The Edgar Winter Group, who created such hits as the number one "Frankenstein" and "Free Ride" (with lead vocals by its writer Hartman). Released in November 1972, <i>They Only Come Out at Night</i>, peaked at the number 3 position on the Billboard Hot 200 and stayed on the charts for 80 weeks. It was certified gold in April 1973 by the RIAA, and double platinum in November 1986.
</p><p>Winter invented the keyboard body strap early in his career, an innovation that allows him the freedom to move around on stage during his multi-instrument high-energy performances.
</p><p>After <i>They Only Come Out at Night</i>, Winter released <i>Shock Treatment</i>, featuring guitarist Rick Derringer in place of Ronnie Montrose. That album contained Winter's third and final Top 40 single "River's Risin<span>'</span>", again sung by Hartman. Later albums included <i>Jasmine Nightdreams</i>, <i>The Edgar Winter Group with Rick Derringer</i>, <i>Together</i>, <i>Recycled</i>, a reunion with White Trash, <i>Standing on Rock</i>, <i>Mission Earth</i>, <i>Live in Japan</i>, <i>Not a Kid Anymore</i>, <i>The Real Deal</i>, <i>Winter Blues</i> and <i>Rebel Road.</i>

</p><p>Major national television and radio campaigns have used Winter's music to advertise their products. Winter has also made frequent television appearances, both to promote his music and to give his opinions, on shows such as <i>Politically Incorrect</i>. Winter also starred with George Hamilton in a commercial for Miller Lite beer. He appeared in the film <i>Netherworld</i> and the TV shows <i>The Cape</i>, <i>Mysterious Ways</i>, <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, and <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>.

"Runnin<span>'</span>" peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Singles Sales chart and the soundtrack was #1 for 8 consecutive weeks. Blues performer Jonny Lang also covered "Dying to Live" around this time. Winter performed the song solo at the piano on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>
</p><p>Winter's 2003 CD and DVD titled <i>Live at the Galaxy</i> was recorded live at the Galaxy Theatre for Classic Pictures.

<p>Winter also produced, arranged, and performed on the 1986 album <i>Mission Earth</i>. This album's lyrics and music were written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard is said to have left detailed instructions and audio tapes for the musicians and producers to follow when making the album. Winter described <i>Mission Earth</i> as "both a return to rock's primal roots and yet highly experimental."  Winter wrote, "Ron's technical insight of the recording process was outstanding." Winter also described Hubbard's delineation of counter-rhythm in rock as something "which was nothing short of phenomenal, particularly in as much as it had then been entirely unexplored and only later heard in the African-based rhythms of Paul Simon's work, some five years after Ron's analysis."

<p>Winter and his wife, Monique, live in Beverly Hills, California. The couple have no children. Winter stated in an interview: "I can see how that would be a wonderful rewarding thing, but I think there are enough people in the world" and that "it might have been more problematical if I had children with a career and all of it. I tour all the time. If I were to have children, I would want to be home all the time."
