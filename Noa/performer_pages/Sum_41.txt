<p>Sum 41 has its origins in the band Kaspir, which was formed by Deryck Whibley and Grant McVittie in 1994, inspired by Weezer and Nirvana. As time went on, the band's drummer was replaced by Steve Jocz and the music became increasingly inspired by NOFX, particularly their 1991 album <i>Ribbed</i>. Seeing this change as too sonically dissimilar to their original sound, they decided to form a new band and to change their sound because they sounded "like the early nineties rock music we used to listen to, and don't anymore". The band chose the name "Sum 41" after looking at the calendar and counting how many days it had been from the start of their summer break to the day the Warped Tour was on and seeing that it was forty-one days. The band debuted its new name during Supernova's Battle of the Bands on September 28, 1996. The first lineup to use this name included Whibley, Jocz, McVittie and Jon Marshall. Another early member was bassist Richard Roy who shortly replaced McVittie.
</p><p>Their first televised live performance was at <i>Jonopalooza</i>, on the Canadian teen talk show Jonovision hosted by Trailer Park Boys star, and Canadian comedian, Jonathan Torrens.
</p><p>The band met their manager and producer Greig Nori, also the lead vocalist of the band Treble Charger, in 1996 at Jonopalooza, and Whibley convinced Nori to watch his band perform.  Nori was not impressed with the band's songs or the original vocalist Jon Marshall and advised Whibley to be the vocalist instead causing Marshall to leave.  With Whibley moving to lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Dave Baksh, a friend of Deryck and Steve and fellow student at Exeter High School, joined as lead guitarist. During the band's first tour in New Brunswick, the band was involved in a near-fatal car accident, when their Ford Econoline van was broadsided by an F-150; Roy, who was driving the van, quit the band after returning home. Mark Spicoluk briefly filled in as the band's new bassist in 1998, until he was replaced by Jason McCaslin, another friend of the band's and student at Exeter High School, in 1999. In 1996, the band opened for Len.

<p>In 1998, the band recorded a demo tape on compact cassette which they sent to record companies in the hope of getting a recording contract.
</p><p>From 1999 to 2000, the band recorded several new songs. The <i>Introduction to Destruction</i> and later the <i>Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's</i> DVDs both contain the self-recorded footage, which show the band performing a dance to "Makes No Difference" in front of a theatre.
</p><p>After signing with Island Records in 1999, Sum 41's first EP, <i>Half Hour of Power</i>, was released on June 27, 2000.

The album featured a harder and edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook. The album peaked at number 32 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and at number eight on the Top Canadian Albums chart. It was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.
</p><p>The first single released from the album was "Still Waiting", which peaked at number seven on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, "The Hell Song" peaked at number 13 on the chart.

In late May 2004, the band travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo with War Child Canada, a branch of the British charity organization War Child, to document the effects of the country's civil war. There had been a stoppage in fighting for almost a year and a half, yet days after arriving, fighting broke out in Bukavu near the hotel where the band was staying. The band waited for the fighting to die down, but it did not. A UN peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armoured carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly twenty hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and forty other civilians were taken to safety.</p>
<p>In honour of Pelletier, Sum 41 named its next album <i>Chuck</i>; it was released on October 12, 2004. The album charted at number 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart.

The next day, Whibley confirmed Baksh's official departure and announced that the band would only replace him with a touring guitarist, who would not have any decision-making power in the band or be in videos, photo shoots, or albums. The band hired Gob frontman and guitarist Tom Thacker to replace Baksh.
</p>

Whibley co-wrote the first single from the album, "Little Know It All", and joined Iggy on the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i> to promote it. Following the band's show of September 11, 2005, in Quebec City, Quebec, the band went on a touring hiatus, although on April 17, 2006, Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop, joining Iggy on stage for "Little Know It All" and "Lust For Life".
</p><p>During the band's 2006 touring hiatus, Whibley focused on his producing career: he produced two songs for Avril Lavigne's album <i>The Best Damn Thing</i>. Jocz recorded his first video as director for a Canadian band, The Midway State, and McCaslin started a side project with Todd Morse of H<sub>2</sub>O and Juliette and the Licks. McCaslin's two-person band, named The Operation M.D., released its debut album, <i>We Have an Emergency</i>, in early 2007. In 2022, Whibley was featured on the Simple Plan single, "Ruin My Life".

<p>Sum 41 has been described as pop-punk, skate punk, punk rock, heavy metal, alternative metal, melodic hardcore, alternative rock, thrash metal, pop rock, punk metal, arena rock, and hard rock.
</p><p>In a November 2004 interview, Deryck Whibley said: "We don't even consider ourselves punk. We're just a rock band. We want to do something different. We want to do our own thing. That's how music has always been to us." Dave Baksh reiterated Whibley's claims, stating "We just call ourselves rock... It's easier to say than punk, especially around all these fuckin' kids that think they know what punk is. Something that was based on not having any rules has probably one of the strictest fucking rule books in the world."
</p><p>Sum 41's musical style has consistently changed between albums. The band's EP <i>Half Hour of Power</i> is described as pop-punk and skate punk. <i>All Killer No Filler</i> was also described as pop-punk and skate punk (except for "Pain for Pleasure", which is purely heavy metal). <i>Does This Look Infected?</i> has been described as punk rock, pop-punk melodic hardcore, horror punk, and heavy metal. <i>Chuck</i> departed heavily from their pop-punk origins, into a sound influenced by heavy metal and hardcore punk, and has been categorised by critics as alternative metal, thrash metal and melodic hardcore. <i>Underclass Hero</i> was as a revival of the band's pop-punk style, however differentiated itself from their early work through its heavy use of acoustic guitars, complex vocal harmonies, pianos and organs. <i>Screaming Bloody Murder</i> saw the band turn in a much darker direction. Sonically it was a return to metal, while also incorporating elements of garage rock and, on some songs, progressive rock. <i>13 Voices</i> and <i>Order in Decline</i> saw the band continue in this heavier direction, incorporating elements of hardcore punk, metalcore and thrash metal. Their final album, <i>Heaven :x: Hell</i>, is a double album which features both a return to the pop-punk sound of the band's early career, and a continuation of the band's later heavy metal sound. This album was also described as skate punk, alternative rock, and alternative metal.
</p><p>Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; "Still Waiting" is an anti-George W. Bush and anti-Iraq War song, "The Jester" and "March of the Dogs" also are critical of Bush, "45 (A Matter of Time)" is critical of U.S. president Donald Trump, "Underclass Hero" is a song about class struggle, and "Dear Father" and "Never There" are about Whibley's absent father.
</p><p>Sum 41's influences include Weezer, Slayer, the Police, Devo, Megadeth, Pennywise, Refused, Rancid, No Use for a Name, the Vandals, Anthrax, Carcass, Dio, Judas Priest, Foo Fighters, Green Day, NOFX, Lagwagon, Face to Face, Nirvana, the Beatles (including John Lennon's solo work), Elvis Costello, Beastie Boys, Run–D.M.C., Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and Iron Maiden.
Sum 41 has inspired modern artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer, Seaway, Dune Rats, Marshmello, PVRIS, Trash Boat, Neck Deep, the Vamps, Bully, Waterparks, and Roam.
