<p><b>William Michael Albert Broad</b> (born 30 November 1955), known professionally as <b>Billy Idol</b>, is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Idol achieved fame in the 1970s on the London punk rock scene as the lead singer of Generation X. He later embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made him a lead artist during the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" in America.
</p><p>Idol began his music career in 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea, but left the group after a few weeks and formed Generation X with his former Chelsea bandmate Tony James. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the UK and released three studio albums on Chrysalis Records before disbanding. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album <i>Billy Idol</i> (1982) was a commercial success, and Idol became a staple of the then-new television channel MTV with the music videos for his singles "Dancing with Myself" and "White Wedding".
</p><p>Idol's second studio album <i>Rebel Yell</i> (1983) was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles "Rebel Yell" and "Eyes Without a Face". The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 2 million copies in America, and he then released <i>Whiplash Smile</i> (1986). He released the greatest hits album <i>Idol Songs: 11 of the Best</i> (1988), which went platinum in the UK, and then released <i>Charmed Life</i> (1990) and the concept album <i>Cyberpunk</i> (1993).
</p><p>Idol spent the second half of the 1990s focusing on his personal life out of the public eye. In 1990, he broke his leg in a motorcycle accident, and later said in his biography <i>Dancing With Myself</i> (2014) that "by the time the motorcycle accident happened, [he] had been living by the credo 'live every day as if it's your last, and one day you're sure to be right'". He made a musical comeback with the release of <i>Devil's Playground</i> (2005) and later released <i>Kings &amp; Queens of the Underground</i> (2014) and <i>Dream Into It</i> (2025).

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Early_life">Early life</h2>
<p>William Michael Albert Broad was born in Stanmore on 30 November 1955, to Irish housewife Joan (née O'Sullivan) and English salesman William Alfred Broad. His mother was from Cork, while his father was from Birmingham and therefore qualifies for Irish citizenship through his mother, but it is unknown if he has ever applied for it. His parents attended Church of England services regularly. In 1958, at the age of two, he moved with his parents to the U.S. and settled in Patchogue, New York; they also lived in Rockville Centre, New York. His younger sister, Jane, was born during this time. The family returned to England four years later and settled in Dorking. In 1971, when Idol was 15, the family moved to Bromley, where he attended Ravensbourne School for Boys. His family later moved to Goring-by-Sea, where he attended Worthing High School for Boys. In October 1975, he began attending the University of Sussex to pursue a Philosophy with Literature degree, but left after year one in 1976. He later joined the Bromley Contingent, a loosely organised gang of Sex Pistols fans who travelled to see the band wherever they played.

<p>The stage name "Billy Idol" was coined after a chemistry teacher, Bill Price, described Idol as "idle" on his school report card. Idol has stated that he had hated chemistry and underachieved in it. In an interview on 21 November 1983, he said of the name, "It was a bit of a goof, but part of the old English school of rock. It was a 'double thing', not just a poke at the superstar-like people... It was fun, you know?" In another interview for <i>BBC Breakfast</i> in October 2014, he said that he wanted to use the name "Billy Idle", but thought the name would be unavailable due to its similarity to the name of Monty Python star Eric Idle and chose Billy Idol instead.
</p><p>In late 1976, Idol joined the newly formed West London 1960s retro-rock band Chelsea as a guitarist. The act's singer/frontman Gene October styled Idol's image, advising him to use contact lenses instead of eyeglasses for his short sight, and dye his hair blonde with a crew cut for a retro-1950s rocker look. After a few weeks performing with Chelsea, Idol and Tony James, the band's bass guitarist, quit and co-founded Generation X, with Idol switching from guitarist to the role of singer/frontman. Generation X was one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme <i>Top of the Pops</i>. Although a punk rock band, they were inspired by mid-1960s British pop, in sharp contrast to their more militant peers, with Idol stating, "We were saying the opposite to the Clash and the Pistols. They were singing 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones', but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones."
</p><p>In 1977, Idol sang "Your Generation" on the TV series <i>Marc</i>. Generation X signed a recording contract with Chrysalis Records, released three studio albums, performed in the 1980 film <i>D.O.A.: A Rite of Passage</i>, and then disbanded.

<p>Idol moved to New York City in 1981 and became a solo artist, working with former Kiss manager Bill Aucoin. Idol's punk-like image worked well with the glam rock style of his new partner on guitar, Steve Stevens. Together they worked with bassist Phil Feit and drummer Gregg Gerson. Idol's solo career began with the Chrysalis Records EP titled <i>Don't Stop</i> in 1981, which included the Generation X song "Dancing with Myself", originally recorded for their last album <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>, and a cover of Tommy James and the Shondells' song "Mony Mony". Idol's debut solo album <i>Billy Idol</i> was released in July 1982.
</p><p>Part of the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the US in 1982, Idol became an MTV staple with "White Wedding" and "Dancing with Myself". The music video for "White Wedding" was filmed by the British director David Mallet and played frequently on MTV. The motorcycle smashing through the church window stunt was carried out by John Wilson, a London motorcycle courier. In 1983, Idol's label released "Dancing with Myself" in the US in conjunction with a music video directed by Tobe Hooper, which played on MTV for six months.
</p><p><i>Rebel Yell</i> (1983), Idol's second LP, was a major success and established Idol in the United States with hits such as "Rebel Yell", "Eyes Without a Face", and "Flesh for Fantasy". "Eyes Without a Face" peaked at number four on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and "Rebel Yell" reached number six in the UK Singles Chart.

<p>Idol released <i>Whiplash Smile</i> in 1986, which sold well. The album included the hits "To Be a Lover", "Don't Need a Gun" and "Sweet Sixteen". Idol filmed a video for the song "Sweet Sixteen" in Florida's Coral Castle.
</p><p>A remix album was released in 1987, titled <i>Vital Idol</i>. The album featured a live rendition of his cover of Tommy James' "Mony Mony". In 1987, the single topped the United States chart and reached number 7 in the UK.
</p><p>On 6 February 1990 in Hollywood, Idol was involved in a serious motorcycle accident that nearly cost him a leg. He was hit by a car when he ran a stop sign while riding home from the studio one night, requiring a steel rod to be placed in his leg. While he was hospitalised, he vowed to stop wearing clothing featuring the Confederate flag, after a black employee tending to him explained his feelings on it.
</p><p>Prior to the accident, film director Oliver Stone had chosen Idol for the role of Jim Morrison's drinking pal Cat in his film <i>The Doors</i> (1991), but it prevented him from participating in a major way and Idol's role was reduced to a small part. He was James Cameron's first choice for the role of the villainous T-1000 in <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i> (1991); the role was recast as a result of the accident.
</p><p><i>Charmed Life</i> was released in 1990, and a video for the single "Cradle of Love" had to be shot. The song was featured in the Andrew Dice Clay film <i>The Adventures of Ford Fairlane</i>. Because Idol was unable to walk due to injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident, he was shot from the waist up. The video featured video footage of him singing in large frames throughout an apartment while Betsy Lynn George was trying to seduce a businessman. The video was placed in rotation on MTV. "Cradle of Love" earned Idol a third Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance.

</p><p>In the 2002 NRL Grand Final in Sydney, Idol entered the playing field for the half-time entertainment on a hovercraft to the intro of "White Wedding", of which he managed to sing only two words before a power failure ended the performance.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Artistry">Artistry</h2>

<p>Billy Idol established himself in the late-1970s London punk scene as the frontman of Generation X, a band criticized as too "poppy." AllMusic critic Greg Adams labeled their self-titled debut album as "bubblegum punk", while their second album, <i>Valley of the Dolls</i> has a glam punk sound, influenced by progressive rock, and Bruce Springsteen's mid-1970s work. After renaming to Gen X and going in a more new wave direction on their third album, <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>, the band released the single "Dancing with Myself", an early example of Idol incorporating dance and pop into his music. The song was a commercial disappointment, and the band disbanded soon after.
</p><p>The musical style of Idol's solo career is a blend of pop hooks, punk attitude, and dance beats, described as dance-punk, dance-rock, glam punk, glam rock, hard rock, new wave, pop-punk, pop rock, post-punk,  and power pop. <i>Rolling Stone</i> critic Johnathan Taylor labeled his debut EP and solo release, <i>Don't Stop</i>, as dance-rock, but on his self-titled debut album, he transitioned to "mainstream power rock" with vocals reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, Lou Reed and Dave Clark. His second album, <i>Rebel Yell</i>, is a mix of hard rock, new wave and pop, cementing Idol as a "punk-pop star", according to AllMusic critic Matt Collar. He retained this sound into the early 1990s, but experimented with other genres, such as synth-pop in "Eyes Without a Face" (1984) and jazz in "Endless Sleep" (1990).
</p><p>Idol's biggest change in sound was on <i>Cyberpunk</i>, a techno-rock album based on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s, with synthesised vocals, electronic and industrial elements, looped beats, as well as keyboard riffs. <i>Devil's Playground</i>, his first album in 12 years, has a more hard rock-oriented style, while keeping up with pop-punk bands, such as Green Day and Sum 41. Since then, he's returned to a sound more reminiscent of his 1980s work, combining new wave and hard rock on his two most recent albums, <i>Kings &amp; Queens of the Underground</i> and <i>Dream Into It</i>. The latter is his second concept album, and has elements of soft rock and grunge.
</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Personal_life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Idol resides in Los Angeles. He has never married, but was previously in a long-term relationship with English singer and dancer Perri Lister. They have a son, Willem (born 1988), who has been a member of the rock band FIM. They separated in 1989. Idol also has a daughter, Bonnie, from another relationship. As of 2024, he has three granddaughters. Idol released his memoir <i>Dancing with Myself</i> in 2014.
</p><p>In 2023, Idol revealed he had another son, Brant Broad, after Bonnie took a 23andMe DNA test and learned she had a half-brother. Idol introduced Broad publicly as his son at his Hollywood Walk of Fame induction ceremony that year.
</p><p>Idol has struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction, including heroin and cocaine. In his 2014 memoir, he said there was more than one time he woke up in a hospital after passing out in a nightclub. In 1994, he collapsed outside a Los Angeles nightclub due to an overdose of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). He stopped his drug use after this incident, as he decided his children would never forgive him for dying of a drug overdose. In 2014, he said he had not taken hard drugs since 2003 but added that he smoked cannabis regularly and was an occasional drinker. In addition to his British citizenship, Idol gained American citizenship in 2018.
