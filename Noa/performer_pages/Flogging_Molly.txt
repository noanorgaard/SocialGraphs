<h3 data-mw-anchor="Early_years">Early years</h3>
<p>Prior to forming Flogging Molly, Dublin-born Dave King was the lead singer for the heavy metal band Fastway featuring guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke of Motörhead in the early to mid-1980s. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring Mandy Meyer of Krokus and Asia on guitars. Afterward, King retained a record deal with Epic Records and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.
</p><p>In 1993, King met violin player Bridget Regan, guitarist Ted Hutt, bassist Jeff Peters and drummer Paul Crowder, and put together a rock band with a Celtic music influence. They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock music. Putting King's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played weekly at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as "Black Friday Rule" and "Selfish Man", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal. King and Regan began to find new members and the current band was formed.
</p><p>They continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone's. They put out a live album, <i>Alive Behind the Green Door</i>, in 1997. In an interview with <i>Kerrang!</i> magazine, King stated that the band's name comes from the bar (Molly Malone's) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, "We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly." They were signed onto SideOneDummy Records after a show when the record company's owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style">Musical style</h2>
<p>Flogging Molly's music is influenced by various artists, such as The Dubliners, The Pogues, Horslips, Johnny Cash, and The Clash. The album <i>Within a Mile of Home</i> (2004) is dedicated to the memories of Cash and The Clash frontman Joe Strummer.
</p><p>Their music ranges from boisterous Celtic punk, like the pirate-themed "Salty Dog", "Cruel Mistress", and "Seven Deadly Sins", or the defiant "What's Left of the Flag", "Drunken Lullabies", and "Rebels of the Sacred Heart", to more somber songs like "Far Away Boys", "The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors)", "Life in a Tenement Square", and "Float". Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the Catholic Church. "What's Left of the Flag" and "The Likes of You Again" were written as tributes to King's father, who died when King was a child.
