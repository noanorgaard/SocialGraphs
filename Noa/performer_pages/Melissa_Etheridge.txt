<p><b>Melissa Lou Etheridge</b> (born May 29, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and guitarist. Her eponymous debut album was released in 1988 and became an underground success. It peaked at No. 22 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and its lead single, "Bring Me Some Water", garnered Etheridge her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female in 1989. Her second album, <i>Brave and Crazy</i>, appeared that same year and earned Etheridge two more Grammy nominations. In 1992, Etheridge released her third album, <i>Never Enough</i>, and its lead single, "Ain't It Heavy", won Etheridge her first Grammy Award.
</p><p>In 1993, she released what would become her mainstream breakthrough album, <i>Yes I Am</i>. Its tracks "I'm the Only One", "If I Wanted To", and "Come to My Window" all reached the Top 40 in the United States, while the latter earned Etheridge her second Grammy Award. <i>Yes I Am</i> spent 138 weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, peaking at No. 15, and earning a RIAA certification of 6× Platinum, her largest selling album to date. Her fifth album, <i>Your Little Secret</i>, was released in 1995 and peaked at No. 6 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, her highest-charting album to date. Its tracks "Nowhere to Go" and "I Want to Come Over" both reached the Top 40 in the United States.
</p><p>Etheridge achieved further success with her albums <i>Breakdown</i> (1999), <i>Skin</i> (2001), and <i>Lucky</i> (2004). In October 2004, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, she made a return to the stage, performing a tribute to Janis Joplin with Joss Stone. Stone began the performance with "Cry Baby" and Etheridge, bald from chemotherapy, joined her to perform the song "Piece of My Heart". Their performance was widely acclaimed, and India.Arie later wrote "I Am Not My Hair" about Etheridge. Later that year, Etheridge released her first compilation album, <i>Greatest Hits: The Road Less Traveled</i>. A great commercial success, it peaked at No. 14 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and went Gold almost immediately. Etheridge has released 16 studio albums to date, the most recent being <i>One Way Out</i> (2021).
</p><p>Etheridge is known for music with a mixture of "confessional lyrics, pop-based folk-rock, and raspy, smoky vocals". She has been a gay and lesbian rights activist since her public coming out in January 1993. Among her various accolades, Etheridge has received two Grammy Awards (from 15 nominations), and an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "I Need to Wake Up" from the film <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> (2006).

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Early_life_and_career">Early life and career</h2>
<p>Etheridge was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, the younger of two daughters of Elizabeth (Williamson), a computer consultant, and John Etheridge, an American Constitution teacher at her alma mater, Leavenworth High School. John Etheridge died in August 1991.
</p><p>Etheridge began guitar lessons when she was eight. She started to play in local country music groups in her teenage years and graduated from high school in 1979. While attending college at Berklee College of Music, Etheridge played the club circuit around Boston. After three semesters, Etheridge decided to drop out of Berklee and move to Los Angeles to attempt a career in music.

<p>Etheridge was discovered at Vermie's, a bar in Pasadena, California. She had made some friends on a women's soccer team, and those new friends came to see her play. One of the women was Karla Leopold, whose husband, Bill Leopold, was a manager in the music business. Karla convinced Bill to see Etheridge perform live. He was impressed, and became a pivotal part of Etheridge's career.  This, in addition to her gigs in lesbian bars around Los Angeles, led to her discovery by Island Records chief Chris Blackwell. She signed a publishing deal to write songs for films including the 1986 movie <i>Weeds</i>.
</p><p>After an unreleased first effort that was rejected by Island Records as being too polished and glossy, she completed her stripped-down, self-titled debut in just four days. Her eponymous debut album <i>Melissa Etheridge</i> (1988), was an underground hit, and the single "Bring Me Some Water" performed well on radio and was nominated for a Grammy Award.
</p><p>At the time of the album's release, it was not generally known that Etheridge was a lesbian. While on the road promoting the album, she paused in Memphis, Tennessee, to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program <i>Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland</i>, explaining the intensity of her music by saying: "People think I'm really sad—or really angry. But my songs are written about the conflicts I have...I have no anger toward anyone else." She invited the radio syndication producer to attend her concert that night. He did and was surprised to find himself one of the few men in attendance.
</p><p>Etheridge's second album, <i>Brave and Crazy</i>, was released in 1989. <i>Brave and Crazy</i> followed the same musical formula as her eponymous debut; it also garnered a Grammy nomination. The album peaked at No. 22 on the <i>Billboard</i> charts (equal to her first album). Etheridge then went on the road, like one of her musical influences, Bruce Springsteen, and built a loyal fan base.
</p><p>In 1992, Etheridge released her third album, <i>Never Enough</i>. Similar to her prior two albums, <i>Never Enough</i> didn't reach the top of the charts, peaking at No. 21, but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female for her single "Ain't It Heavy". <i>Never Enough</i> was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time. With rumors circulating around her sexuality (Etheridge was not out yet at this point), the album seemed to inadvertently address these rumors.
</p><p>In 1992, Etheridge established a performing arts scholarship at Leavenworth High School in honor of her recently deceased father. According to Etheridge, her father purchased her first guitar and "would come with me to bars in the area when I played because I was underage".

<p>In January 1993, Etheridge came out publicly as a lesbian. On September 21, 1993, she released <i>Yes I Am</i>, which became her mainstream breakthrough album. Co-produced with Hugh Padgham, <i>Yes I Am</i> spent 138 weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 charts and peaked at No. 15. It scored two mainstream hits: "Come to My Window" and her only <i>Billboard</i> Top 10 single,  "I'm the Only One", which also hit No. 1 on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Adult Contemporary chart. <i>Yes I Am</i> earned a RIAA certification of 6× platinum.
</p><p>Etheridge earned her second Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female for her single "Come to My Window". She also garnered two additional nominations in the Best Rock Song category for "I'm the Only One" and "Come to My Window", losing to Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia".
</p><p>In 1993, Etheridge boycotted playing shows in Colorado over its passage of Amendment 2.
</p><p>Also in 1994, she was honored by VH-1 for her work with the AIDS organization L.A. Shanti. During the televised occasion, she highlighted the appearance with a performance of "I'm the Only One" and a duet with Sammy Hagar covering The Rolling Stones' song, "Honky Tonk Women."
</p>

<p>The album's fifth single, "If I Wanted To", debuted on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 at No. 25 in February 1995 and peaked at No. 16 later that March.
</p><p>The success of <i>Yes I Am</i> helped increase sales of Etheridge's earlier albums. In 1995, <i>Melissa Etheridge</i> earned a RIAA certification of 2× platinum, while <i>Never Enough</i> earned a RIAA certification of platinum.
</p><p>Etheridge's follow-up to <i>Yes I Am</i> was the successful <i>Your Little Secret</i> (1995). The album was not as well received by critics as Etheridge's prior recordings. Featuring a lead single of the same name, <i>Your Little Secret</i> is the highest-charting album of Etheridge's career, having reached No. 6 on the <i>Billboard</i> album charts; however, the album spent only 41 weeks on the chart. The album produced two Top 40 singles "I Want to Come Over" (<i>Billboard</i> No. 22, <i>RPM</i> No. 1) and "Nowhere to Go" (<i>Billboard</i> No. 40) and earned a RIAA certification of 2× platinum.

<p>In 1996, Etheridge won an ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award. She also took a lengthy break from the music business to concentrate on her family when her first two children Bailey (1997) and Beckett (1998) were born. She also recorded "Sin Tener A Donde Ir (Nowhere to Go)" for the AIDS benefit album <i>Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin</i> produced by the Red Hot Organization.
</p><p>Etheridge returned to the music charts with the release of <i>Breakdown</i>  in October 1999. <i>Breakdown</i> peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts and spent 18 weeks in the charts. Despite this, <i>Breakdown</i>  was the only album of Etheridge's career to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album (losing to Santana's <i>Supernatural</i>). In addition, her single "Angels Would Fall" was nominated in two categories: Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (losing to Sheryl Crow) and Best Rock Song (losing to the Red Hot Chili Peppers) in 2000. A year later, another single from the album—"Enough of Me"—was nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (also losing to Sheryl Crow). The album was certified gold by the RIAA.
</p><p>The year 2001 saw the release of <i>Skin</i>, an album she described as "the closest I've ever come to recording a concept album. It has a beginning, middle and end. It's a journey." <i>Skin</i> garnered generally positive reviews with Metacritic scoring the album 73/100 from 9 reviews. Recorded after her breakup with partner Julie Cypher, <i>Skin</i> was described as "[a] harrowing, clearly autobiographical dissection of a decaying relationship." Despite positive reviews, <i>Skin</i> sold less than 500,000 copies. On the Billboard charts, it peaked at No. 9 but dropped out of the Top 200 after just 12 weeks. The single "I Want to Be in Love" was nominated for the Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (losing to Lucinda Williams). The music video for the song starred Jennifer Aniston.
</p><p>In 2002, Etheridge released an autobiography entitled <i>The Truth Is: My Life in Love and Music</i>.

<p>Etheridge began 2004 with the release of her eighth album <i>Lucky</i> on February 10.

It also garnered a Grammy nomination for Etheridge's cover of the Greenwheel song "Breathe" for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo (losing to Bruce Springsteen).
</p><p>In October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer. At the 2005 Grammy Awards (the same ceremony for which "Breathe" was nominated), she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to Janis Joplin with the song "Piece of My Heart".

</p><p>On September 10, 2005, Etheridge participated in ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief, a telethon in support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

She is also an advocate for environmental issues and in 2006, she toured the US and Canada using biodiesel.
</p>

<p>Etheridge had a long-term partnership with Julie Cypher, and their relationship received coverage in <i>The Advocate</i>, when an interview with editor Judy Wieder done in Amsterdam, "The Great Dyke Hope", was released in July 1994. In it, Etheridge answered Wieder's questions about why the couple wanted to have children: "I think one of the many fears people have about homosexuality is around children. I think that the more gay parents raise good, strong, compassionate people, the better the world will be." During this partnership, Cypher gave birth to two children, Bailey Jean and Beckett. Cypher became pregnant via artificial insemination using sperm donated by musician David Crosby. On September 19, 2000, Etheridge and Cypher announced they were separating.

But there are also good people out there, Christian and otherwise, that are beginning to listen."
</p><p>In 2013, Etheridge called Angelina Jolie's choice to have a double mastectomy to avoid the possibility of breast cancer a "fearful" choice. Etheridge told the <i>Washington Blade</i> in an interview that "my belief is that cancer comes from inside you and so much of it has to do with the environment of your body...It's the stress that will turn that gene on or not...I really encourage people to go a lot longer and further before coming to that conclusion." Andrea Geduld, the director of the Breast Health Resource Center at Mt. Sinai Hospital, criticized Etheridge's remarks. Experts also cautioned that Etheridge's statements were not accurate.
