</p>

<p><b>Green Day</b> is an American rock band formed in Rodeo, California, in 1987, by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, with drummer Tré Cool joining in 1990. In 1994, their major-label debut <i>Dookie</i>, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 20 million copies in the U.S. Green Day has been credited with reigniting mainstream interest in punk rock.
</p><p>Before taking its current name in 1989, the band was named <b>Blood Rage</b>, then <b>Sweet Children</b>. They were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from 924 Gilman Street, a club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records, including their first album <i>39/Smooth</i> (1990). For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990, before the recording of the band's second studio album <i>Kerplunk</i> (1991). Though the albums <i>Insomniac</i> (1995), <i>Nimrod</i> (1997), and <i>Warning</i> (2000) did not match the success of <i>Dookie</i>, they were still successful, with <i>Insomniac</i> and <i>Nimrod</i> reaching double platinum status, while <i>Warning</i> achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called <i>American Idiot</i> (2004), found popularity with a younger generation and sold six million copies in the U.S. Their next album <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> was released in 2009. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i>, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not commercially perform as well as expected, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. These albums were followed by <i>Revolution Radio</i> (2016), which became their third to debut at No. 1 on the <i> Billboard</i> 200, <i>Father of All Motherfuckers</i> (2020), and <i>Saviors</i> (2024).
</p><p>In 2010, a stage adaptation of <i>American Idiot</i> debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, the Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Longshot, and the Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.
</p><p>Green Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the best-selling music artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy Awards and won five: Best Alternative Album for <i>Dookie</i>, Best Rock Album for <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", and Best Musical Show Album for <i>American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording</i>.

<p>In 1987, guitarist friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, both 15 years old at the time, along with bassist Sean Hughes and drummer Raj Punjabi, a fellow student from Pinole Valley High School, formed the band Desecrated Youth and played together in Punjabi house garage in Rodeo, California.
</p><p>A few months later, the band renamed to Sweet Children. One of their first songs written together was "Best Thing in Town". The group's first live performance took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as "Al Sobrante", who replaced original drummer Raj Punjabi. It was around this time that bassist Sean Hughes also left the band, causing Dirnt to switch from guitar to bass. Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (featuring Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, who would later contact Armstrong to fill in as a second guitarist for their band Rancid) as a major influence in inspiring him to form a band.
</p><p>In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In April 1989, the band released its debut extended play <i>1,000 Hours</i>. Shortly before the EP's release, the group dropped the name Sweet Children.  According to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. Sweet Children adopted the name Green Day, instead, due to the members' fondness for cannabis. In the Bay Area, where the band was formed, "green day" was slang for spending a day doing nothing but smoking marijuana. Armstrong admitted in 2001 that he considered it to be "the worst band name in the world".
</p><p>Lookout! released Green Day's debut studio album <i>39/Smooth</i> in early 1990. Green Day recorded two extended plays later that year, <i>Slappy</i> and <i>Sweet Children</i>, the latter of which included older songs the band recorded for Minneapolis independent label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released <i>39/Smooth</i> as <i>1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours</i> and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, <i>Slappy</i> and <i>1,000 Hours</i>. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Kiffmeyer left the East Bay area to attend Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. The Lookouts' drummer Tré Cool began filling in temporarily, and later permanently, a situation which Kiffmeyer "graciously accepted". The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993 and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. By then, the band's second studio album <i>Kerplunk</i> had sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. Green Day supported another California punk band Bad Religion as an opening act for their <i>Recipe for Hate Tour</i> for most of 1993.

<p><i>Kerplunk'</i>s underground success led to interest from major record labels and a bidding war to sign Green Day. The band eventually left Lookout! and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band the Muffs and later remarked that Cavallo "was the only person we could talk to and connect with". Reflecting on this period, Armstrong told <i>Spin</i> magazine in 1999, "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." After signing with Reprise, the band began recording its major-label debut, <i>Dookie</i>. On September 3, 1993, Green Day played their last show at 924 Gilman under the pseudonym <b>Blair Hess</b> before being banned permanently because of their major label signing.
</p><p>Recorded in three weeks and released in February 1994, <i>Dookie</i> became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs "Longview", "Basket Case", and "When I Come Around", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies in the US. At a performance on September 9, 1994, at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs), and by the end of the rampage 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the festivals Lollapalooza and Woodstock '94, at the later of which the group started an infamous mud fight. During the concert a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions on pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition. In 1995, <i>Dookie</i> won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album, and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year.
</p><p>In the band's homestead East Bay following <i>Dookie'</i>s success, the band felt a sense of hostility. Billie Joe Armstrong recalled aggressive glares and furtive whispers. The band's success would trickle onto other East Bay bands such as Jawbreaker, a local favorite of Armstrong's, which garnered accusations of selling out during a concert he attended.

<p>In 1995, a single titled "J.A.R." for the <i>Angus</i> soundtrack was released and debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Modern Rock Tracks chart. The band's fourth studio album <i>Insomniac</i> was released in the fall. Compared to the more melodic <i>Dookie,</i> <i>Insomniac</i> was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity. The album opened to warm critical reception, earning 4 of 5 stars from <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which said "In punk, the good stuff unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets." The singles released from <i>Insomniac</i> were "Geek Stink Breath", "Stuck with Me", "Brain Stew/Jaded", and "Walking Contradiction".
</p><p>Though the album did not approach the success of <i>Dookie</i>, it sold three million copies in the United States. The album earned the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for "Walking Contradiction" earned the band nominations for Best Video, Short Form, at the Grammys, in addition to Best Special Effects at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly canceled a European tour, citing exhaustion.
</p><p>Following a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on their next album in 1997. From the outset, Cavallo and the band agreed it had to be different from previous albums. The result was <i>Nimrod</i>, an experimental deviation from the band's standard melodic punk rock. The album was released in October 1997 and provided a variety of music, from punk, pop, hardcore, folk, surf rock, and ska, to the acoustic ballad "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)". <i>Nimrod</i> entered the Billboard charts at Number 10. The mainstream success of "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was used in the second clip show episode of <i>Seinfeld</i> and two episodes of <i>ER</i>. The other singles released from <i>Nimrod</i> were "Nice Guys Finish Last", "Hitchin' a Ride", and "Redundant". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of <i>King of the Hill</i> later that year. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of <i>Nimrod</i>. In 1999, Jason White began supporting the band during concerts as guitarist.
</p><p>In 2000, Green Day released their folk-punk-inspired sixth studio album <i>Warning,</i> and, in support, participated in that year's Warped Tour. In November 2000, in a show produced by Ian Brennan, the band performed for free on the steps on San Francisco's City Hall to protest the eviction of artists from the city. The band also launched an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. AllMusic gave it 4.5/5, saying, "<i>Warning</i> may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying." <i>Rolling Stone</i> was more critical, giving it 3/5 and saying, "<i>Warning ...</i> invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot core's biggest-selling band?" Though it produced the hit "Minority" and smaller hits "Warning" and "Waiting" , some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached at least triple platinum sales, <i>Warning</i> was only certified gold.
</p><p>At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards for which they were nominated: Outstanding Album (<i>Warning</i>), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (<i>Warning</i>), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, <i>International Superhits!</i> and <i>Shenanigans</i>, followed <i>Warning</i>. <i>International Superhits!</i> had a companion collection of music videos, <i>International Supervideos!</i> <i>Shenanigans</i> contained collected B-sides, including "Espionage", which was featured in the 1999 film <i>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</i> and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In Spring 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182, documented on the DVD <i>Riding in Vans with Boys</i>.

<p>In the Summer and Fall of 2002, the band wrote and recorded material for an album tentatively titled <i>Cigarettes and Valentines</i>, set to release in August 2003. Dirnt said the album was written and recorded in six months, and the official track list consisted of 16 songs. He also said two or three additional songs were recorded and were something "worth chasing" after turning in the record. The band got together and thought the additional songs were really good. Instead of releasing <i>Cigarettes and Valentines</i>, the band decided to make an album with those additional songs, which lead to the creation of <i>American Idiot</i>:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>Those are really good songs, but we got these over here, and we kinda felt like, should we put out these, and wait three or four years to put out these other songs and chase this thing that we kind of got going on over here?</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the band has stated multiple times that when the album was nearly finished, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work.
</p><p>It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the band, who concealed their identities with masks and costumes, released an album called <i>Money Money 2020</i> in September 2003, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to similarities in the bands' sounds. At the time, these rumors were not addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. The bands "feuded" via press releases and statements from Armstrong. Several journalists openly referred to the group as a Green Day side project, although it was not confirmed as such until 2013.
</p>

<p>Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album <i>Skull Ring</i> in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of "I Fought the Law" (originally performed by The Crickets) made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII.
<i>American Idiot</i> was released in September 2004 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Backed by the success of the album's first single "American Idiot", it was the band's first album to reach this pinnacle. <i>American Idiot</i> was labeled a <i>punk rock opera</i> and follows the journey of the fictitious "Jesus of Suburbia". It depicts modern American life under the control of an idiot ruler who lets people be misinformed by the media and a "redneck agenda". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, it became protest art and went on to sell 6 million copies in the US.
</p>

<p><i>American Idiot</i> won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated in six other categories, including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards it was nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" video won six of those awards. A year later, "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" won Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2009, <i>Kerrang!</i> named <i>American Idiot</i> the best album of the decade, <i>NME</i> ranked it number 60 in a similar list, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked it 22nd. <i>Rolling Stone</i> also listed "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" and "American Idiot" among the 100 best songs of the 2000s, at number 65 and 47, respectively. In 2005, the album ranked 420 in <i>Rock Hard</i> magazine's book <i>The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time</i>. In 2012, the album was ranked number 225 on <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
</p>

<p>During the American Idiot World Tour, the group filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD set  <i>Bullet in a Bible</i> on November 15, 2005. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band and showed how its members prepared to put on the show. The final concerts of the 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17, respectively.
</p><p>On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-<i>Dookie</i> material from Lookout Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006, the band was awarded People's Choice Award for favorite musical group or band.

<p>Green Day engaged in many smaller projects in the time following the success of <i>American Idiot</i>. In 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, the group released a garage-rock-inspired album titled <i>Stop Drop and Roll!!!</i>. The Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues such as the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.
</p>

<p>In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that the band's drummer Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.
</p>

<p><i>21st Century Breakdown</i> was released on May 15, 2009. The album received mainly positive reception from critics, who gave it an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. It reached number one in fourteen countries and was certified gold or platinum in each, achieving Green Day's best overall chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. These were the group's first live shows in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour starting in North America in July 2009, and continued through the rest of 2009 and early 2010. The album won Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. As of December 2010, <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> has sold 1,005,000 copies in the US.
</p><p>Walmart refused to carry the album, as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker, and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, "There's nothing dirty about our record<span> </span>... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something."
</p><p>In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer, along with many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical <i>Spring Awakening,</i> to create a stage version of the album <i>American Idiot</i>. The musical <i>American Idiot</i> opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre at the end of 2009. The show featured an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, <i>American Idiot</i> opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song titled "When It's Time". In June 2010, it was released as a single on iTunes.
</p>

<p>During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own <i>Rock Band</i> video game titled <i>Green Day: Rock Band</i> (2010), as a follow-up to the last band-specific game, <i>The Beatles: Rock Band</i> (2009). The game features the full albums of <i>Dookie</i>, <i>American Idiot</i>, and <i>21st Century Breakdown,</i> as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.
</p><p>During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour, the band members stated they were writing new material. In an interview with <i>Kerrang!</i> magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: "We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow, and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form." The band members also stated that the group was recording a live album of the tour, featuring the previously unreleased song "Cigarettes and Valentines". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W and mentioned that the group had completed the writing process of their ninth studio album. Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album would most likely be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray titled <i>Awesome as Fuck</i> was released on March 22, 2011.

<p>During the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i> which would be released in fall 2012. The trilogy featured longtime touring guitarist Jason White joining the band in the studio as an additional musician. This marks the first time that White had played guitar on a Green Day album. That summer, Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows, including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p><i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i> were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012, respectively, and were met with generally positive reviews from critics, though fans were more lukewarm towards the albums. On January 22, 2013, the band announced that <i>¡Cuatro!</i>, a documentary about the making of <i>¡Uno!, ¡Dos!</i> and <i>¡Tré!</i>, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called <i>Broadway Idiot</i> which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began its 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold. The band played <i>Dookie</i> from start to finish on several dates on the tour's European leg, including during the Reading Festival 2013 headline show.
</p><p><i>Demolicious</i>, a compilation album that contains alternate versions and demos of songs from <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i> and <i>¡Tré!</i> recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called "State of Shock" and an acoustic version of "Stay the Night", from <i>¡Uno!</i>.

<p>Green Day performed their first concert in a year on April 16, 2015. The group first played a set as Sweet Children with John Kiffmeyer, followed by a set as Green Day. On April 18, 2015, Green Day were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Fall Out Boy.
</p><p>On April 24, 2015, Rob Cavallo revealed Green Day were recording a twelfth studio album. Cavallo claimed to have heard "five new songs that Billie has written and demoed", and that the fans should be "sure that when they do return, the music will be amazing". On December 24, 2015, Green Day released a Christmas song, "Xmas Time of the Year".
</p><p>On August 11, 2016, Green Day released the first single, "Bang Bang", from the group's twelfth studio album, <i>Revolution Radio</i>, which was released on October 7, 2016. The band went on a world tour supporting the album. In November 2016, the band performed at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles and made a political statement about the then-recent US election of Donald Trump by chanting "No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA" during their rendition of "Bang Bang".
</p><p>Aaron Burgess at <i>Alternative Press</i> observed, "It's the first time in years Green Day haven't had all the answers. But as a statement on how it feels to fight, it's the closest to the truth they've ever gotten." Gwilym Mumford of <i>The Guardian</i> stated "[after their last few albums] the band have decided to get back to basics: <i>Revolution Radio</i> is their most focused work in years. Lead single "Bang Bang" sets the tone, with a caustic consideration of the fame-hungry psychosis of a mass shooter".
</p><p>The band released their second greatest hits compilation, <i>God's Favorite Band</i>, on November 17, 2017. It contains 20 of their hits, along with two new tracks: a different version of the <i>Revolution Radio</i> track "Ordinary World", featuring country singer Miranda Lambert, and a previously unreleased song titled "Back in the USA".

<p>In November 2022, the band stated they were recording for a new studio album. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo, marking his first album working with the band since <i>¡Tré!</i> (2012).

On September 30, 2023, Green Day was announced as the halftime show at the 110th Grey Cup. The following day, the band launched a new website with the name "The American Dream Is Killing Me". Included on the website was a video appearing to tease new music, and a circled date of October 24, 2023, leading some news outlets to believe that it is related to their next album. Before the album's release, they played the first song, "The American Dream Is Killing Me", during a live show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 19, 2023, and announced the Saviors Tour, which first North American leg was joined by the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and the Linda Lindas.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h3>
<p>Green Day's sound is described as "often hard-driving and aggressive", and is often compared to first wave American and British punk rock bands such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Dickies, and Buzzcocks. The band is primarily known for its heavy use of power chords combined with "strong pop melodic sensibility". Several publications have characterized the band as punk rock, <span>pop-punk,</span> skate punk, melodic punk, alternative rock, and more controversially, power pop.  The band has casually explored other musical styles, including post-punk and pop-rock with <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, and garage rock on <i>¡Dos!</i> and <i>Father of All..</i>. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as "punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs." Among the labels of the band by critics, members Billie Joe Armstrong and Tré Cool have stated in interviews with <i>Livewire</i> and <i>Kerrang!</i> self-describing Green Day as just a punk rock band.
</p><p>Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal hardcore punk bands Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's "Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely" as a B-side to the "Warning" single, and the character "Mr. Whirly" in the group's song "Misery" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Southern California-based hardcore bands Social Distortion and Bad Religion have also been cited as influences. Green Day would cover the former's song "Another State of Mind" from their 1983 debut release, <i>Mommy's Little Monster</i> as a bonus track for <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>.
</p><p>Outside of their punk influences, Green Day have also cited hard rock bands the Kinks, the Who, and Cheap Trick. In August 1996, Billie Joe Armstrong told <i>Guitar World</i> he "can remember a few different instances" of when he first discovered punk rock: "There were these two guys who introduced me to things like D.O.A. and the Dead Kennedys. Then, in the seventh grade, there was a girl at school who would bring in records like T.S.O.L. and say, 'Here, listen to this.'" Armstrong said he thinks he "really started getting into" punk rock "in 1987 with <i>Turn It Around!</i>, a double seven-inch compilation record put out by [punk fanzine] <i>Maximumrocknroll</i>." Armstrong cited <i>Turn It Around!</i> as an influence, calling it "a pretty big record" for him. Armstrong would also cite fellow East Bay punk bands Operation Ivy, Jawbreaker, and Crimpshrine as influences. Tré Cool has stated that the band is influenced by music that they did not like, naming artists like Hall &amp; Oates, Cyndi Lauper and other 1980s music.
</p><p>Although Green Day has been compared to Buzzcocks, the Ramones and the Clash, Mike Dirnt said he had never heard Buzzcocks when Green Day began. Dirnt said: "First off, you can't sound like any of those bands. And secondly, those are probably the last ones in my record collection." Armstrong responded to Dirnt, saying: "Mine too. Those are all bands I got into later." The Dickies is another band Green Day has been compared to. Dirnt said he "never owned a Dickies album, although" he "did see" the Dickies live "around the time of" <i>Kerplunk!</i>. Dirnt said "by that time, we'd played so many shows it had no bearing." Armstrong referred to the Dickies as "just another Ramones rip-off". Although in August 1996, Armstrong said bands like the Ramones are bands he listened to later, in June 2010, Armstrong cited the Ramones as an influence. He also said his "range of favorite songwriters goes anywhere from the Sex Pistols to Lennon–McCartney." During the <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> era of Green Day, the band was influenced by the Who, U2, Motown albums, and musicals such as <i>Grease</i>.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Lyrical_themes">Lyrical themes</h3>
<p>Green Day's lyrics explore themes including adolescence, substance abuse, heartbreak, political sociology and anti-authoritarianism. While Armstrong is the band's primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. The band's lyrics frequently incorporate profanity. In 2016, a study of 361 musical artists conducted by music data company Musixmatch found that Green Day used profanity the most among the rock music artists included in the study, beating out Red Hot Chili Peppers and Aerosmith. The study suggested that across a selection of 136 tracks from the band's catalogue, the swear words most frequently uttered were "fuck", "fucking", and "shit", respectively.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Live_performances">Live performances</h3>
<p>Billie Joe Armstrong regularly invites musicians at Green Day concerts onstage to substitute for the band members on guitar, bass and drums, often letting the guest musicians keep the instruments they used during their guest spots. Armstrong explains, "I remember being a kid and seeing Van Halen play. I was, like, 12, and Eddie would come out, and I'd go, 'God, it would be so cool to be up there and do what he's doing. So I was always keeping that in mind, subconsciously that's basically what ended up happening, breaking down the barrier between the band and the audience."
</p><p>In 2016, Armstrong began altering lyrics during live performances to criticize members of the Trump Administration. He later did this to JD Vance and Elon Musk. Other live lyrical alterations include references to the Israel-Gaza War, which voiced support for Palestine.
</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>The band's 1991 album <i>Kerplunk</i> is one of the bestselling independent albums of all time, selling over 4.5 million copies worldwide. It was also listed in a 2007 ranking of the 100 greatest indie albums by Blender.
</p><p>Green Day is credited (alongside Bad Religion, the Offspring, NOFX, Social Distortion, and Rancid) with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States, particularly with the album <i>Dookie</i>, which was cited by Fuse as the most important pop-punk album of all time, the best alternative album of 1994 by <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and as one of the best punk rock albums of all time by <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Kerrang!</i>, <i>Revolver</i>, and <i>LA Weekly</i>. It was also placed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "Definitive 200" list of 200 classic albums. Both <i>Dookie</i> and <i>American Idiot</i> appeared on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2011, they were voted best punk rock band of all time by <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Diffuser.fm listed <i>Dookie</i> as the greatest album of the 90s.
</p><p>Green Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the highest-selling artists of all time. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for <i>Dookie</i>, Best Rock Album for <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", and Best Musical Show Album for <i>American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording</i>.
</p><p>In 2010, a stage adaptation of <i>American Idiot</i> debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, their first year of eligibility.
</p><p>The band has been cited as an influence by a variety of artists, including Alkaline Trio, Avril Lavigne, AFI, Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, Joyce Manor, Lady Gaga, Wavves, Fidlar, Tegan and Sara, the Menzingers, New Found Glory, Prince Daddy &amp; the Hyena, Bowling for Soup, Billie Eilish, and Sum 41.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Related_projects">Related projects</h2>
<p>Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White and the Longshot with Jeff Matika, the Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and the Network, a collaboration between Green Day and friends in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled <i>Stop Drop and Roll!!!</i> on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called the Boo which recorded a one-off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store. Since January 2018, Armstrong, Dirnt and White have played in the band the Coverups along with Green Day audio engineer Chris Dugan and tour manager Bill Schneider. The band sporadically performs one-off shows, usually in small clubs, and cover the songs of classic rock and alternative rock bands such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Clash, and Nirvana.
</p><p>In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song "The Saints Are Coming", originally recorded by the Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.
</p><p>Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song "Working Class Hero", which was featured on the album <i>Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur</i>. The band performed the song on the season finale of <i>American Idol</i>. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to the White Stripes' "Icky Thump". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in <i>The Simpsons Movie</i>, where the band performed a rock version of the show's theme song. Their version of it was released as a single on July 23, 2007.
</p><p>In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director Michael Mayer to adapt the group's rock opera <i>American Idiot</i> into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of <i>American Idiot: The Musical</i> have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of <i>The New York Times</i> wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." Jed Gottlieb of the <i>Boston Herald</i> enjoyed the premise of the show but found that "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated".
</p><p>Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be "visually striking [and] musically adventurous", but noted that "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development". Paul Kolnik in <i>USA Today</i> enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". <i>Time</i> magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative." He concluded that "<i>American Idiot</i>, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers—for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." Peter Travers from <i>Rolling Stone</i>, in his review of <i>American Idiot</i>, wrote "Though <i>American Idiot</i> carries echoes of such rock musicals as <i>Tommy</i>, <i>Hair</i>, <i>Rent</i> and <i>Spring Awakening</i>, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. <i>American Idiot</i> knows no limits—it's a global knockout." The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for several Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.
</p><p>In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, was supported by the band, and led by the group's manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that "[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it." For Billie Joe Armstrong, "Many of the artists<span> </span>... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression."
</p><p>On April 13, 2011, a film version of <i>American Idiot</i> was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, would have directed the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced <i>Bullet in a Bible</i>, <i>Awesome as Fuck</i>, and <i>Heart Like a Hand Grenade</i>), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. However, in February 2020, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed to <i>NME</i> that plans for a film adaptation of the stage musical had been "pretty much scrapped", without providing anymore details as to the reason.
</p><p>On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called <i>Broadway Idiot</i> and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the <i>American Idiot</i> musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' <i>60 Minutes</i> and PBS documentaries such as <i>Nova</i>, <i>Frontline</i> and <i>American Masters</i>. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.
</p><p>Green Day served as executive producers of <i>Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk</i> (2017), an extensive documentary film about the San Francisco Bay area punk scene from the late 1970s to the 1990s.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="New_Years_Rev"><i>New Years Rev</i></h3>
<p>On February 10, 2024, Live Nation Productions announced a comedy film titled <i>New Years Rev</i>, which was described as a "coming-of-age tale", inspired by the true exploits of the band prior to their mainstream breakthrough in 1994. Production of the film was said to be underway in the US state of Oklahoma. Lee Kirk was announced as the film's writer and director. As of February 11, a release date had not been announced. Live Nation Productions, the film and TV arm of Live Nation Entertainment, was said to be producing the film. Green Day guitarist and vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tré Cool were announced as the film's producers, in collaboration with Tim Perell. The band members were also confirmed to be making an appearance in the film themselves. Ryan Kroft, Michael Rapino, Jonathan Daniel were announced as the film's executive producers. Mason Thames, Kylr Coffman and Ryan Foust were announced as the film's stars.  Jenna Fischer, who portrayed the character Pam Beesley in the American sitcom <i>The Office</i>, was confirmed to have a role in the film. Angela Kinsey, who acted in the same series, was also confirmed to have a role in the film. The film's logline read, "Their roadtrip is a rowdy and mischievous jaunt across the country filled with adventures, based on the exploits of Green Day and their years of living in a tour van." According to Ryan Kroft of Live Nation Productions, the film "[tells] the story of three friends as they travel across the United States after mistakenly thinking they'll be opening for a Green Day New Years concert in Los Angeles." Billie Joe Armstrong said, "Van days rule. You will drive all night on no sleep then play a show for 10 kids in a basement of a friend of a friend's house 50 miles east of anywhere you've ever heard of. But you'll do it again the next day, and the one after that. Because you're doing it with your bandmates who become your family and it's unlike anything you've ever known. It's electric. Let the music and mischief ensue." Lee Kirk had previously worked with Billie Joe Armstrong on the 2016 <i>Ordinary World</i>, which the latter had made an appearance in. Kirk had also previously directed an episode of <i>The Office</i>, and is also the spouse of Jenna Fischer.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Controversies">Controversies</h2>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Music_style">Music style</h3>
<p>Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes "true punk". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former frontman of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented, "So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do." However, others in the punk rock scene would come to the defense of the band on their punk status. Bad Religion lead guitarist Brett Gurewitz and founder of the independent punk label Epitaph Records would state, "They [Green Day] are a punk band, but you know, punk is the legacy of rock and roll, and Green Day are the biggest band in the genre."
</p><p>Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, "Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.<span>'</span>" In 2021, Armstrong condemned the band's labeling as "pop-punk" by critics in a Vulture magazine interview, stating, "I never really liked that term (pop punk), it turned into sort of a genre. I never thought of myself as a pop artist. I've always been left of center. To say you're a pop-punker ... it never sat well with me." Armstrong acknowledged the band's more melodic punk style compared to other bands from the Bay Area scene it emerged from, but also brought up the band's performance alongside East Bay hardcore bands like Neurosis, Engage, Spitboy, Blatz, and Filth.
</p><p>In 2006, English rock musician Noel Gallagher of the Britpop band Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song "Wonderwall" with "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="2012_iHeartRadio_Festival_incident">2012 iHeartRadio Festival incident</h3>
<p>On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing "Basket Case", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&amp;B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes [Left]", saying "You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!" He also told the crowd he "was not Justin Bieber" and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas", also adding that Armstrong would be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i> that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant. The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, <i>Revolution Radio</i>. They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album <i>Father of All Motherfuckers</i>.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Mad_Cool_incident">Mad Cool incident</h3>
<p>On July 7, 2017, about 20 minutes before Green Day headlined Mad Cool, a festival in Madrid, an acrobat fell about 30 metres (98 ft) from a cage above the stage and died. Some fans were upset at the band and festival organizers for continuing the show, which was attended by about 35,000 people. On their website, Armstrong said the band did not know about the accident before their set, and likely would not have played if they had.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Oracle_Park_incident">Oracle Park incident</h3>
<p>On September 20, 2024, Green Day performed a show in San Francisco at Oracle Park. During the concert, Billie Joe Armstrong expressed his anger over the Athletics leaving Oakland, repeatedly cursing Las Vegas and called it "the worst shithole in America". He also criticized A's owner John Fisher, saying "We don't take shit from people like fucking John Fisher<span> </span>… I hate Las Vegas." In protest of Armstrong's comments, two Las Vegas radio stations (KOMP 92.3 and X107.5) banned all Green Day music from their playlists.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Elon_Musk_incidents">Elon Musk incidents</h3>
<p>In January 2025, while on tour in South Africa, Green Day once again adapted the lyrics of their breakout hit "American Idiot" to criticize Elon Musk. At their Calabash Festival headliner performance at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 19 January, lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong altered the line "I'm not a part of a redneck agenda" to "I'm not a part of the Elon agenda."
</p><p>Musk, who had previously mocked Green Day on X (formerly Twitter) in early 2024, calling their commentary "milquetoastedly raging for it", had branded the band as hypocritical in their anti‑"machine" rhetoric. In response, bassist Mike Dirnt defended the group in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, stating, "Elon Musk actually is the machine… He's not shy about saying stupid shit on the internet… The song's twenty years old, and we're Green Day. What did you expect?".
