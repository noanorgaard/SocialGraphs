<p><b>The Hives</b> are a Swedish garage rock band formed in Fagersta in 1993. After gaining success in Sweden throughout the 1990s, they rose to worldwide prominence in the early 2000s during the garage rock revival. The band's line-up—consisting of Howlin' Pelle Almqvist (vocals), Nicholaus Arson (lead guitar, backing vocals), Vigilante Carlstroem (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Dr. Matt Destruction (bass), and Chris Dangerous (drums)—remained unchanged from 1993 until 2013, when Matt Destruction retired for health reasons and was replaced by The Johan and Only, the former Randy bassist.
</p><p>The Hives have released seven studio albums: <i>Barely Legal</i> (1997), <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i> (2000), <i>Tyrannosaurus Hives</i> (2004), <i>The Black and White Album</i> (2007), <i>Lex Hives</i> (2012), <i>The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons</i> (2023), and <i>The Hives Forever Forever The Hives</i> (2025). They have also released the compilation album <i>Your New Favourite Band</i> (2001), the live DVD <i>Tussles in Brussels</i> (2005), and the live album <i>Live at Third Man Records</i> (2020). Their mainstream success came with the release of <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i> and its single "Hate to Say I Told You So", considered their signature song. They are known for always dressing in matching black-and-white tuxedos and for their energetic and eccentric live shows, with critics hailing them as one of the best live rock bands of the last two decades.

<p>The Hives was formed in 1993 by brothers Per "Pelle" Almqvist (Howlin' Pelle Almqvist) and Niklas Almqvist (Nicholaus Arson) in Fagersta. Friends of the brothers, Mikael Karlsson (Vigilante Carlstroem), Mattias Bernvall (Dr. Matt Destruction) and Christian Grahn (Chris Dangerous), soon joined the band and took punk rock-inspired stage names like the brothers. Drummer Dangerous suggested the name "Hives" for the band as he had read the word for the skin disease in a dictionary. The other members misunderstood the condition based on his description of it, as Howlin' Pelle later explained, "we thought it was a way more lethal disease, for one, and we thought it was way more contagious. So, we figured that we'd spread like a deadly disease across the land". The band went by the name Hives for some time before they realized that "all good band names are plurals", and added a 'the' to their name.
</p><p>The band's first recording was a 1994 demo titled <i>Sounds Like Sushi</i>. In 1995, the band signed with Burning Heart Records, a Swedish independent record label. The following year they released their debut EP <i>Oh Lord! When? How?</i> In 1997, the band released their debut studio album, <i>Barely Legal,</i> and embarked on a tour in support of it. The <i>Barely Legal</i> track "The Stomp" was later featured on the soundtrack of the film <i>RocknRolla</i>. The band's early releases would be marked by the influence of such bands as Rancid, New Bomb Turks, Turbonegro, and Dead Kennedys.
</p><p>In 1998, the band released their second EP, <i>A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T</i>. Burning Heart signed a deal with Epitaph Records to distribute the band's material in the United States during that same year.

<p>The Hives released their second studio album, <i>Veni Vidi Vicious,</i> in April 2000 through Burning Heart Records. The band members described the album as being like "a velvet glove with brass knuckles, both brutal and sophisticated at the same time". The album yielded the singles "Hate to Say I Told You So", "Main Offender", "Die, All Right!", and "Supply and Demand". The album track "The Hives – Introduce the Metric System in Time" was included on the punk rock compilation album <i>Punk-O-Rama Volume 5</i> from Epitaph later that year. "Hate To Say I Told You So" was later included on the soundtrack for <i>Spider-Man</i>, and also featured in the video game Forza Horizon . The track "Main Offender" was featured in the video game <i>Rock Band</i> while "Die, All Right!" was released as downloadable content in the game's digital music store.
</p><p>After seeing the video for "Hate to Say I Told You So" on German television, industry executive Alan McGee decided to sign the band to his newly formed Poptones label. Poptones released the 'best of' compilation <i>Your New Favourite Band</i> in 2001, which proved to be the band's breakthrough record, reaching number seven on the UK album charts. Following the success of the album, the band re-released the singles "Hate to Say I Told You So" and "Main Offender", which reached number 23 and 24 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. The band also re-released <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i> in the US.
</p><p>During the promotion of <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i> and <i>Your New Favourite Band</i>, the Hives signed a record deal with Universal Music, reportedly worth $10 million. The signing was a result of Epitaph selling the rights to the band's material in the US to Warner Bros. Records without informing the members beforehand. A dispute followed between the Hives and the labels, who claimed that the band were still contracted for one more album, in which a lawsuit was filed against the band and settled out of court.

<p>All songwriting except covers on the band's albums are credited to "Randy Fitzsimmons". The band claims Fitzsimmons was an honorary "sixth Hive", who along with writing their music, discovered and managed the band. The band has included hidden references to a sixth member of the band, including a hidden sixth pair of legs on the back cover of the <i>Tyrannosaurus Hives</i> album art. "Randy Fitzsimmons" is a registered pseudonym for guitarist Niklas Almqvist.
</p><p>The Hives are renowned for their energetic and highly rated live shows, with <i>Spin</i> ranking them number eight on their list of best live bands in 2006 and frontman Howlin' Pelle receiving particular praise for his showmanship. When asked about their efforts to connect with the audience, drummer Dangerous replied that "there are so many bands out there that don't say a word to the crowd. I don't get it. They don't even look at the audience and that's ridiculous". In 2023, Howlin' Pelle commented on the effects of their live shows saying "we give so much energy and then it kind of bounces right back. So on one hand your body gets tired but your soul feels better and better. So it's not just tiring, like it also gives you a lot of energy". The Hives always dress in matching black-and-white tuxedos because "it makes [them] look like [they] belong together".
