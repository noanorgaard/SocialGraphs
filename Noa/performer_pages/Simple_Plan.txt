<p>In 1993, lead vocalist Pierre Bouvier and drummer Chuck Comeau were in a band named Reset. In 1998, Comeau left the group to go to college. In mid 1999, he met with high school friends and guitarists Jeff Stinco and Sébastien Lefebvre who were in separate bands of their own. Comeau, Stinco, and Lefebvre formed a new band together, called Simple Plan. In late 1999, Bouvier and Comeau reacquainted at a Sugar Ray concert and Bouvier left Reset soon after to join Comeau in the band. Bassist and backing vocalist David Desrosiers replaced Bouvier in Reset, but he too left the band six months later to join Simple Plan. This allowed Bouvier, who had doubled as the band's lead vocalist and bassist, to concentrate on  singing, and Stinco, who had doubled as the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist, to concentrate on guitar. In 2001 the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto.
</p><p>Originally, the band did not have the name. At first, they considered naming the band <b>Touchdown 999</b>; later Bouvier's friends chose the name Simple Plan, derived from the 1998 film <i>A Simple Plan</i>.

<p>In 2002, Simple Plan released their debut studio album, <i>No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls</i>, which featured the singles "I'm Just a Kid", "I'd Do Anything", "Addicted", and "Perfect". The band was aiming for a pure pop-punk record. The record was originally released in the United States with 12 tracks, ending with "Perfect". Enhanced and foreign editions came in several different versions with up to two additional tracks in addition to the original 12. Two pop punk singers contributed on vocals: Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 on "I'd Do Anything" and included vocals by Joel Madden from Good Charlotte on "You Don't Mean Anything." The years of 2002 and 2003 were formative for the band. MTV Networks featured "Addicted" on one of their top performing shows during the spring of 2003 in the United States and internationally; on MTV and MTVu, and was filmed at the University at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo) in Western New York. <i>Addicted</i> was the theme song for <i>Fraternity Life</i>. While the show was taken off the air the following season the band continued to rise on the billboard charts in the United States and performances continued to be booked and reruns of the show played around the world.
</p><p>In 2002, the band also performed and recorded the theme song for a rebooted installment of the Scooby-Doo franchise, <i>What's New, Scooby-Doo?</i>. This show used the band's intro throughout its entire run until its conclusion in 2006. It also featured many of the band's songs within episodes of the show, including "I'd Do Anything".
</p><p>In 2003, the band played as a headliner on the Vans Warped Tour — an appearance memorialized in the comedy slasher film, <i>Punk Rock Holocaust</i>, in which four of the five band members are killed. The band also played short stints on the Warped Tour in 2004 and 2005. That same year (2003) the band opened for Avril Lavigne on her <i>Try To Shut Me Up Tour</i>. In addition to several headlining tours, the band has also opened for Green Day and Good Charlotte. The album had sold one million copies in early 2003 then went on to sell over four million copies worldwide, making it the band's best selling album to date.
</p><p>In 2004, Simple Plan released its second album, <i>Still Not Getting Any...</i> which was produced by Bob Rock and led to the subsequent singles, "Welcome to My Life", "Shut Up", "Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)", "Crazy", and (in some markets) "Perfect World".
</p><p>According to the album's bonus DVD, the band originally considered other names for it like <i>Get Rich or Die Trying</i>, <i>Enema of the State</i>, and <i>In The Zone</i> before deciding on <i>Still Not Getting Any...</i>. The name stemmed from the band's belief that they were not getting any good reviews, with Bouvier once noting that the band only had one recent good review in <i>Alternative Press</i>. <i>Still Not Getting Any...</i> was a musical departure from the group's previous album: the band retained its style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carried the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in "I'm Just a Kid" from <i>No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls</i>, the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop punk style of the group's last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of "classic" or "mainstream" rock elements, claiming the album "de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock".
</p><p>In 2005, their cover version of Cheap Trick's "Surrender" was featured in the soundtrack album for the superhero film, <i>Fantastic Four</i>.

<p>After nearly a year and a half in support of <i>Still Not Getting Any...</i>, the band ended most touring in February 2006. They were playing only a few shows, taking some time off, and beginning work on the third studio album. Bouvier headed to Miami as on about 21 March 2007 to work with Dave Fortman. The band entered the studio for pre-production in Los Angeles on 29 June. On 15 July the band returned to Montréal to record at Studio Piccolo, the same studio in which the band had recorded <i>Still Not Getting Any...</i>. The band finished recording and headed back to Miami and Los Angeles to mix the album. The final part of making the record was done in New York City, and it was officially completed on 21 October.
</p><p><i>When I'm Gone</i>, the first single from <i>Simple Plan</i>, was released on 29 October. This album was produced by both Dave Fortman and Max Martin. On 17 February 2008, the band achieved its highest-charting single in the U.K. After the first two albums just missed the UK top 40, "When I'm Gone" gave the band its best chart position in the UK, coming in at number 26.
</p><p>Simple Plan held an extensive tour schedule in support of the album. After completing an around-the-world promotional tour, they played several holiday shows during December 2007. After they continued promotional tours in January, Simple Plan played a triple bill in Camden Town, London on 27 January 2008, with the first show featuring songs from the band's first CD, the second from the second, and the third from the new release. The band played four U.S. shows in late February, and completed a European tour running until late April. The band played four Japan dates, followed by several European festivals and headlining dates. On 1 July 2008, the band gave a free concert on Québec City's Plains of Abraham, attracting a crowd of 150,000 people to the Canada Day show. After a return to the Far East in late July and early August, the band played a Cross Canada Tour with Faber Drive, Cute is What We Aim For and Metro Station.  After dates in Germany, Mexico, and Australia, the band played its second full European tour of the year from 28 October to 29 November, playing in Estonia and Poland for the first time. The band also played in Tel Aviv and Dubai in early December—shows at which the band played as a four-piece, with Desrosiers absent due to a family emergency and Lefebvre on bass.
