<p>Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but they disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side project. They decided to name the experiment "Skillet". After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996, they released their demo album <i>Right Upside Your Head</i>. On October 29 of the same year, they released a self-titled debut <i>Skillet</i>. It was well received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States.
</p><p>Cooper has said the band's name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis—where the band was formed as a worship band side project—gave them their name as he felt they were like "southern cooking, where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol' skillet and see what it turns out like."
</p><p>Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled <i>Hey You, I Love Your Soul</i>, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet abandoned their grunge approach for a lighter industrial alternative rock and style. Cooper's wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.
</p><p>Shortly before the band began recording for their third album, <i>Invincible</i>, Steorts left to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of <i>Invincible</i>. Because of this change, the musical style on <i>Invincible</i> changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of <i>Invincible</i> in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.
</p><p>The band released their first worship album and fourth album overall, <i>Ardent Worship</i>, in late 2000. The band kept much of their sound from <i>Invincible</i> on their next album <i>Alien Youth</i>. With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released <i>Alien Youth</i> on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of <i>Alien Youth</i>, Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar.

<p>In 2003, <i>Collide</i>, the band's fifth studio album, was released by Ardent Records and contained the singles "Savior" and "Collide". In 2004, the rights to <i>Collide</i> were bought by Lava Records, an imprint of Atlantic Records. On May 25, 2004, <i>Collide</i> was re-released by Lava Records, with "Open Wounds" as an added track. The album was nominated for "Best Rock Gospel Album" in 2005.
</p><p>Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on <i>Collide</i>, Cooper said, "Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like. ... All these things ... have been an influence on me."
</p><p>Skillet's album <i>Comatose</i> was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles "Rebirthing", "Whispers in the Dark", "Comatose", "The Older I Get", "Those Nights", "The Last Night" and "Better Than Drugs". The album debuted at No. 55 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and No. 4 on the US Top Christian Albums chart.
</p><p>In January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that "it's time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life". Peters' last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007. However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet's next drummer, Jen Ledger.
</p><p>On October 21, 2008, <i>Comatose Comes Alive</i> was released; a CD/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band's May 9, 2008, concert in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was shown on the Gospel Music Channel on December 5, 2008. Skillet's Comatose Comes Alive CD also had a B-side with "Live Free or Let Me Die" as a single, also with five acoustic tracks which purchasers could download by inserting the CD in their computer.
</p><p>The Comatose album was certified Gold and Platinum in sales by the RIAA on November 3, 2009, and May 20, 2016, respectively.
</p><p>Skillet's seventh album, <i>Awake</i>, contains twelve songs and was released on August 25, 2009. It charted at No. 2 on the Billboard top 200 selling around 68,000 units in its first week. "Monster" was released as a single on July 14, 2009. Contrary to popular belief, John Cooper stated that "Hero" was not the album's lead single. It was, however, released as a single in March 2010. They also released a deluxe version with the extra songs "Dead Inside" and "Would It Matter", along with the original, radio edit of "Monster" that does not have the distorted growl as in the single and in the CD. A remix on "Monster" was featured on one of their popular podcasts. The song "Hero" was used in the publicizing of the first football game of the 2009 NFL season between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans, and the song "Monster" was used in the episode "Jason: The Pretty-Boy Bully" on MTV's Bully Beatdown.
</p><p>"Monster" was the theme song for the WWE event WWE Hell in a Cell, while the song "Hero" was the theme song for WWE Tribute to the Troops and Royal Rumble 2010. Both songs were included on the official soundtrack for the WWE video game <i>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010</i>. "Monster" also became the theme song for the AHL team the Cleveland Monsters, being played in the player intros and after a Cleveland goal, and it serves as the opening theme of the Fresno Monsters of Fresno, California. The song was aired at the beginning of several ACC football games on Raycom Sports during the 2009 season. In the first week of April 2010, "Monster" was released for the Rock band music store in <i>Rock Band 2</i>. <i>Awake</i> also tied the record for highest-charting Christian album on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with Underoath's 2006 release <i>Define the Great Line</i> and Casting Crowns's 2007 release <i>The Altar and the Door;</i> all three albums debuted at No. 2.
