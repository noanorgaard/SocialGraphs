<p>The band was formed in 2012 in Frankenmuth, Michigan by twin brothers Josh and Jake Kiszka, their younger brother Sam, and Kyle Hauck. Creating a band had always been Jake Kiszka's dream; he joined his high school band to further that goal, where he eventually met Hauck. Practicing music together in the Kiszka's family garage led to recruiting brothers Josh and Sam to play, and later to form the band. The band name was created when Hauck heard a relative mention Gretna Van Fleet, a resident of Frankenmuth; their use of the variation on her name was done with her (subsequent) blessing. Van Fleet also stated in a later interview that while the band's music is not her type, she supports the band and thinks they are very talented.
</p><p>With Hauck as drummer, the band recorded three songs: "Cloud Train", "Highway Tune" and "Standing On". Hauck was replaced by the brothers' good friend Danny Wagner in 2013. The initial guitar riff for "Highway Tune" was cited by guitarist Jake Kiszka as being written as early as 2010. The song was released as a single in March 2017. On February 28, 2014, a live EP was recorded in one take and released on June 7, 2014. In March 2014, their song "Standing On" was featured in 2014 Chevy Equinox advertisements in the Detroit area. "Standing On" is one of several songs, along with "By the Riverside", "Cloud Train", "Down to the River", "Motown Funk No. 4", "Sing in the Rain", "Thunder Stomp", "Occidentali", and "Written in Gold", that were previously released but are currently unavailable.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>

<p>Greta Van Fleet's music has been categorized as hard rock, blues rock, and progressive rock. They are sometimes considered part of a classic rock revival. Although all four members bonded over blues, each have their own musical tastes: Jake gravitates towards rock and roll, Sam likes jazz, Danny prefers folk, and Josh likes world music. Jake said in an interview, "that all three brothers had listened to their parents' vinyl which included blues and folk music." Sam stated that, "It's not like we set out to be a rock and roll band, it's just that sound that comes out [when] we get together and play." Songwriting is done by the band as a whole after one of the four members finds the concept for a song. Danny stated that a lot of their songs are first written in a "folk set up" before evolving into something else.
</p><p>Greta Van Fleet is often compared to Led Zeppelin. Jake related that he "... went through a year of really intensely studying what [Jimmy] Page did to the point I knew how he thought." He has also studied other classic rock guitarists in a similar manner, specifically mentioning Pete Townshend. Likewise, on his voice being compared to Robert Plant's, Josh said that Plant has certainly been an influence, "though it's not what I was going for." Stating that he did not even know who Led Zeppelin were until high school, he explained that his singing style came out naturally one day while struggling to be heard over the rest of the band. In a March 2018 interview, Plant said of Greta Van Fleet, "they are <i>Led Zeppelin I</i>" and described Josh as "a beautiful little singer."
</p><p>Some of Jake's other guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. Some of the drummers that inspired Danny are Carmine Appice, John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Michael Shrieve. Sam's favorite bass player is Motown session bassist James Jamerson. Josh Kiszka said that he liked the movements and onstage antics of Joe Cocker.
</p><p>The group was also influenced by Rush, Aerosmith, Queen, and the Doors.
