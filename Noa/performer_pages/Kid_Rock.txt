<p><b>Robert James Ritchie</b> (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as <b>Kid Rock</b>, is an American musician, singer, rapper, and songwriter. After establishing himself in the Detroit hip-hop scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a rap rock sound before shifting his performance style to country rock. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.
</p><p>Kid Rock started his music career as a rapper, releasing his debut album <i>Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast</i> (1990), on Jive Records. His subsequent independent releases <i>The Polyfuze Method</i> (1993) and <i>Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp</i> (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album <i>Devil Without a Cause</i> (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, <i>Cocky</i> (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country, and rock.
</p><p>His most successful single from that time period, "Cowboy" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. His best-selling singles overall are "Picture" (2002) and "All Summer Long" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album <i>Rock n Roll Jesus</i>, his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. Republican Party and holds libertarian views.

<p>Kid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a hip-hop group called the Beast Crew in the late 1980s. During this time, he met D-Nice. That relationship would eventually lead to him becoming the opening act at local shows for Boogie Down Productions.
</p><p>During this time, Kid Rock began a professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who, after some initial skepticism with the idea of a white rapper, found himself impressed with Kid Rock's energetic and well-received performance where the artist, using his own turntables and equipment, actually prepared his own beats to demonstrate his skills for Clark.
</p><p>In 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock. These demos eventually led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records.
</p><p>In 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder in an independent record label that was formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, called "Top Dog" Records. Later, that investment would become a 25% ownership stake.
</p><p>With the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, <i>Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast</i> in 1990. According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.
</p><p>The album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yo and Too Short; Detroit artist James "Blackman" Harris served as Kid Rock's DJ on this tour. During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.
</p><p>Ultimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.

<p>In 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum. Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo. While ICP member Violent J disliked Kid Rock's music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP's debut album, <i>Carnival of Carnage</i>, believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist. Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP's album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 (equivalent to $1,344 in 2024) to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper. Kid Rock showed up to record the song "Is That You?" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.
</p><p>In 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, <i>The Polyfuze Method</i>, with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.
</p><p>Kid Rock also began releasing his "Bootleg" cassette series to keep local interest in his music.
</p><p>Later in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP <i>Fire It Up</i> at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise. The EP featured the heavy rock song "I Am the Bullgod" and a cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s country song "A Country Boy Can Survive".
</p><p>By 1994, Kid Rock's live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and Uncle Kracker, but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band Twisted Brown Trucker.
</p><p>After breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment. During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me", entitled "It's Still East Detroit to Me", which Clark claims led him to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.
</p><p>During this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse.
</p><p>Through extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as "white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap"; this following included local rapper Joe C., who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting him personally, was invited to perform on stage as his hype man.

<p>Kid Rock's stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name "Kid Rock", and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, <i>Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp</i>; the album's title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, "Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp." According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, <i>Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp</i> sold 14,000 copies.
</p><p>Kid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.
</p><p>Although Kid Rock was known for his frequent partying and drug and alcohol use, he primarily focused on increasing his success and fame, prioritizing his role as a businessman. This drive led to increased local success.

<p>Kid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including Beastie Boys' <i>Grand Royal</i> magazine. However, though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, "He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between."
</p><p>In 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock's performances and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs "Somebody's Gotta Feel This" and "I Got One for Ya", which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records. As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.
</p><p>By this time Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona, and musical style and wanted to make a "redneck, shit-kicking rock 'n' roll rap" album, resulting in his fourth studio album, <i>Devil Without a Cause</i>, recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.
</p><p>Carried by singles such as "Bawitdaba" and "Cowboy", the album was a commercial success as it would be certified Gold and Platinum several months after its release, and eventually sold over 14 million copies. In promotion of the record, Kid Rock would join Limp Bizkit on a national tour spanning 27 dates. He performed at Woodstock 1999 and made an appearance on the 1999 MTV VMA, including a performance alongside Aerosmith and Run-DMC. In 1999, Kid Rock made his voice acting debut in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> in the episode "Kill the Alligator and Run" playing himself, alongside rapper Joe C.
</p><p>Despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years by then, Kid Rock was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 2000. Kid Rock's career was sometimes marked by tragedy, as in the death of friend and collaborator Joe C.
</p><p>In May 2000, Kid Rock released the compilation album <i>The History of Rock</i> behind the single "American Bad Ass". The song sampled Metallica's 1991 song "Sad but True", peaking at No. 20 on the mainstream rock chart. Kid Rock would join Metallica on their 2000 Summer Sanitarium Tour along with Korn and System of a Down. Kid Rock and Jonathan Davis filled in on vocals for an injured James Hetfield in Atlanta on July 7, 2000. Kid Rock performed "American Bad Ass" along with the Metallica classics "Sad but True", "Nothing Else Matters", "Fuel" and "Enter Sandman" in addition to covers of "Turn the Page" and "Fortunate Son". <i>The History of Rock</i> was certified double platinum.

<p>In the book <i>Is Hip Hop Dead? The Past, Present, and Future of America's Most Wanted Music</i>, author Mickey Hess identified Kid Rock as connecting hip-hop to rap rock, due to having started out as a hip-hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip-hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip-hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music. He is a self-taught musician and has said that he can play every instrument used in his band. According to <i>The Village Voice</i>, "[Kid Rock's] own love and incorporation of his musical references isn't rooted in a nostalgia or a 'tribute,' but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention." Because of this unique musical approach, Kid Rock has been described as a postmodern artist. <i>American Songwriter</i> says that Kid Rock's style ranges from hard rap to hard rock. <i>CBS</i> says that Kid Rock's style is a mix of "urban rap, rock and roll [and] country and western." The musician jokingly described his own style as being "creatively confused". Reviewing his compilation album <i>The History of Rock</i>, David Browne wrote that "Unlike most of his rap-metal peers, Kid Rock doesn't merely have personality to burn (and a surprisingly likable one) but a sense of history as well. He may be the first rock star who views Americana as not simply blues, country, and boogie rock but classic hard rock and rap as well." A 2015 piece by the <i>Detroit Free Press</i> said that Kid Rock reinvented "his persona from scrappy hip hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman." Covering him in a 1998 piece, <i>MTV</i> described his sound as having "heavy-metal licks and rap riffs". <i>AllMusic</i> described him as a "country rap-rocker" and his music as "rap-meets-rock-meets-country". <i>MTV</i> said that Kid Rock's album <i>Devil Without a Cause</i> helped to "ignite the rap-rock genre" and that the musician broke through into mainstream success "during the peak of rap-rock and nü-metal". In a 2015 interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Kid Rock disavowed nu metal, saying that the genre was "not melodic and doesn't stand the test of time." In a review of his album <i>Sweet Southern Sugar</i>, <i>Cryptic Rock</i> said that after <i>Devil Without a Cause</i> established him as a rap rock artist, "albums that were saturated in old school hip hop slowly but surely began to transform into the Southern country rock landscape that has built Kid Rock's persona." In a review of his album <i>Born Free</i>, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the musician "has slowly abandoned rap for country as he crept closer to middle age", and while reviewing the subsequent album <i>Rebel Soul</i>, Erlewine said that Kid Rock "[planted] his flag on that old-time rock &amp; roll". <i>Billboard</i> said that Kid Rock "fits comfortably into a modern country-rock landscape that seems practically tailor-made for him: a God-fearing good old boy with a hard-rock heart and an outlaw-country spirit." Kid Rock's influences include Bob Seger and Beastie Boys. Regarding his influences, Kid Rock said, "I don't think there isn't anything that hasn't influenced me musically."
</p><p>Summarizing his lyrical themes in a review of his album <i>Cocky</i>, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> wrote of Kid Rock, "Anyone willing to chug Buds, smoke pot, and salute the flag can find a place in Rock's unexpectedly optimistic dreamworld, where the sleaze nation commingles in a warped fantasy of pan-trash peace and harmony." The magazine categorized his lyrics as describing the "ideal of a world where rappers can sip whiskey with rednecks". According to Kid Rock, a fundamental theme in the lyrics of his songs is that "there's still a lot of good left in people, no matter what they do", reflected in his lyrics for "Bawitdaba", which he dedicated to, among others, "topless dancers" and drug users. He explained in a 2000 <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, "I've got a lot of faith in people. Whether it's some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he's got a trust fund, you know. I think there's some good ones out there, just like I think there's some good crackheads out there. It works both ways." Kid Rock developed a "redneck pimp" alter ego to complement his humorous lyrics. According to Kid Rock, "I use straightforward words, you know. I'm not politically correct."
</p><p>His song "Cowboy" is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. <i>Cowboys &amp; Indians</i> claims that "Cowboy" had a major impact on the country music scene; the magazine wrote that artists Jason Aldean and Big &amp; Rich, among others, were influenced by the song's country rap style. Kid Rock also had an impact on hip-hop, serving as an influence on rappers like Yelawolf.

He was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War. Ritchie has met with presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while they were in office. Regarding his political views, Ritchie said, "I have friends everywhere. Democrat, Republican, this that and the other. ... We're all human beings first, Americans second. Let's find some common ground and get along." During his speech at the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he stated that he wanted to "body slam some Democrats".
</p><p>Ritchie supported Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their presidencies.

<p>On July 12, 2017, Ritchie shared a photo of a "Kid Rock for US Senate" yard sign on Twitter. He also launched a website at kidrockforsenate.com, which sold merchandise bearing that inscription. Several weeks later, he wrote a post on his blog stating that he was still "exploring my candidacy", and that, whether or not he ran, he wanted to register people to vote, because "although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it." He added that he wanted "to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians." His statements sparked media speculation that he would try to run on the Republican ticket against sitting Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, as well as enthusiasm from some prominent Republicans, including former New York Governor George Pataki, who wrote on Twitter, "Kid Rock is exactly the kind of candidate the GOP needs right now." In an October 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Ritchie put an end to the speculation, saying that he had never intended to run for Senate, adding rhetorically, "Who couldn't figure that out?". He later clarified that the campaign was a joke that he had started after a Michigan state legislator encouraged him to run for Senate. He expressed surprise at the interest his potential candidacy had received, but also disappointment that some opposed to his candidacy had brought up his previous use of the Confederate flag to label him a racist. He donated the $122,000 he had raised by selling "Kid Rock for U.S. Senate" merchandise to CRNC Action, a College Republican group.
