The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar), Jamie Mathias (bass) and Jason Bowld (drums).

<p>Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael "Padge" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael "Moose" Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, <i>Better Off Alone</i>. They released another two-track EP in 2002, <i>You/Play with Me</i>, which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled <i>Eye Spy</i>. In 2003, their second EP was released titled <i>Don't Walk Away</i>. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James, and the band changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine shortly thereafter. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came "directly out of their heads." Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from <i>The Poison</i>.
</p><p>Roadrunner Records showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five-album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, "We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us." A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, <i>Hand of Blood,</i> was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, "4 Words (To Choke Upon)." Daniel Lukes of <i>Decibel Magazine</i> reviewed the EP by stating, "The worst part is that the music itself isn't all that bad, for the genre." He went on to comment that the band should be "embarrassed" about the release. Zero Magazine's Josh Joyce complimented the band on "how technical they can get without confusing the kids."

<p>Matt Tuck spoke to Daniel Marez of <i>Metal Hammer</i> in March 2009 about the band's progress on writing and recording their third album. Tuck stated that there were four or five songs that were finished and that "usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I'm trying to write the vocals as I write the music." Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is "a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll stand the test of time [more] than both the previous things we've done." In a January 2010 interview with <i>Rock Sound</i>, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled <i>Fever</i>, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to <i>The Poison</i> rather than <i>Scream Aim Fire</i> and contain no ballads.

Tuck commented about the upcoming album: "So it's not ideal, and we did have a lot of plans for the rest of the year for writing and making the record, which are on the backburner now until further notice. [...] It's pretty brutal, to be honest. It couldn't be more of a contrast with <i>Gravity</i> in a ferocious style. It's very technical. [...] The riffs are crushing. There's probably 60 percent aggressive vocals, 40 [percent] clean, which is a ratio we've never really dabbled with before. [...] It's very heavy, it's very technical. For the Bullet fans out there that kind of like that side of this band, it's very cool and very exciting. It feels good."
</p><p>On 11 June 2021, Bullet for My Valentine unveiled a new Patreon page, The Army of Noise, posting that it is "the only place to get the latest BFMV news, early tix, BTS, merch discounts and exclusive items, signed gifts and more.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Bullet for My Valentine has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, melodic metalcore, thrash metal, hard rock, emo, screamo, and post-hardcore. According to <i>Decibel</i>, Bullet for My Valentine's music consists of " 'heavy metal' leads" and " 'post-hardcore' vocals". According to AllMusic, Bullet for My Valentine blend "muscular riffs and emo harmonies" and also "take cues from '80s metal bands and punk-infused metal to make melodic, metallic, dark rock songs." The band describe two of their albums, <i>The Poison</i> and <i>Fever</i>, as having a "super dark" tone. Before they were known as Bullet for My Valentine, Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with "harmony guitars and big angelic choruses," according to Matthew Tuck.
</p><p>
Tuck personally said of the band's sound that "...we're a hard rock band with metal influences, and I've said that from day one." Kirk Miller of <i>Decibel</i> praised the band for the effort in synchronised song structures. When asked of their views on their looks, members of the band have stated that they would not change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, "Without sounding harsh, we're more interested in what our music sounds like than what our fucking hair looks like." Matt Tuck told <i>Exclaim!</i> : "A lot of people already think we're more of an emo band just because of the name of the band. People need to give the music a fair listen musically before they decide to judge it. I say we're a melodic metal band, really. That's how I'd describe us." Tuck said he prefers people call Bullet for My Valentine a heavy metal band instead of categorizing the band under specific subgenres. Jeff Treppel of <i>MetalSucks</i> described the band's first two albums as "solid examples of poppy metalcore." In an interview with Robert Gray from Ultimate-Guitar in 2010, Tuck said that when making the album <i>Scream Aim Fire</i>, Bullet for My Valentine were bothered by critics and journalists who criticized the band and said the band aren't "real metal". Tuck said that the band tried to please people like critics and journalists with <i>Scream Aim Fire</i>. Tuck said: "<i>Scream Aim Fire</i> was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. <i>Fever</i> is an album that was a hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do, or how we should sound." Tuck also said about <i>Scream Aim Fire</i>: "Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of <i>The Poison</i> material." When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band, Tuck said: </p><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>I dunno. I could say both, to be honest. Regardless of what I say, people are gonna think differently, so it doesn't really matter. People label us in genres all the time which aren't accurate, or a true representation, which shows that some people aren't really paying attention. People can call it whatever they want, whether they like it or don't like it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bullet for My Valentine's influences include Killswitch Engage, Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Testament, Stuck Mojo, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Sepultura, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Dire Straits. 
According to Michael Thomas, these are the bands that inspire Bullet for My Valentine's "catchy vocals, aggressive riffs and melodies," Matt Tuck has stated in an interview, his songwriting is highly influenced by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger and Bob Dylan. He goes on to say that "these bands just are proper old school songwriters."
