<p>The band formed in 1999, choosing the name "Trivium" from a Latin three-way intersection to describe their music as combining metalcore, melodic death metal and thrash metal. Singer Brad Lewter then saw Heafy performing a cover version of "No Leaf Clover" by Metallica at Heafy's eighth-grade talent show and later asked him to try out for his band as lead guitarist. The pair went over to drummer Travis Smith's house where they played a rendition of Metallica's "For Whom the Bell Tolls". Impressed with Heafy's performance, they accepted him into the band. Lewter played a number of local gigs with the band before departing about a year later. In mid-2001, Trivium parted ways with its bassist. Trivium asked Richie Brown from local black metal band Mindscar to fill in on bass duties until a full-time member could be brought in. A string of successful shows followed and then a search was conducted for a permanent bassist. In 2001, the band played at a fundraiser for Chuck Schuldiner.
</p><p>In late 2002, Trivium went into the recording studio to record its first high-quality demo disc. A copy of the demo was heard by German label Lifeforce which signed Trivium, and the band entered a studio to record its debut album, <i>Ember to Inferno</i>. Lead guitarist Corey Beaulieu joined after the recording of the album. In 2004, Paolo Gregoletto joined as the band's bassist, replacing Brent Young before a tour with Machine Head. <i>Ember to Inferno</i> managed to garner the interest of Roadrunner Records representatives, who later signed Trivium to the label. The band then began writing songs for their major label debut.

<p>In 2004, Trivium recorded its second album, <i>Ascendancy</i>, in Audiohammer Studios and Morrisound Recording in Florida. Produced by Heafy and Jason Suecof, the album was released in March 2005. The album debuted at No. 151 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and at No. 4 on the <i>Top Heatseekers</i> chart. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus praised <i>Ascendancy,</i> describing Trivium as a "ridiculously tight quartet, unleashing thrilling dual guitar passages and pummeling kick drum gallops as surely as they do melodic breaks and vicious throat screams." Rod Smith of <i>Decibel</i> magazine praised "Smith's impeccably articulated beats, bassist Paolo Gregoletto's contained thunder, and, especially, Heafy and guitarist Corey Beaulieu's liquid twin leads." The album was also recognized as the "Album of the Year" by <i>Kerrang!</i> magazine. Later in 2007 the band received their first Gold Record in the UK for more than 100,000 Sales. 
</p>

<p>In 2005, Trivium played the first Saturday set on the main stage at Download Festival in Castle Donington, England, credited by Heafy as the gig that really launched Trivium on the world stage. Singles and music videos were released for "Like Light to the Flies", "Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr", "A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation", and "Dying in Your Arms". The videos for these songs gained rotation on Scuzz TV and MTV2's Headbangers Ball, and "Pull Harder on The Strings of Your Martyr" has become one of the band's most well known songs and the song that they usually close their sets with. In support of the album, the band opened for Killswitch Engage, Iced Earth, Fear Factory, and Machine Head, who were one of Heafy's largest influences. Trivium also played at Road Rage 2005 and Ozzfest.
</p><p><i>Ascendancy</i> was re-released in 2006 with four bonus tracks and a DVD containing all of the band's music videos and live footage.

<p>In April 2006, after a headlining tour with Mendeed and God Forbid as openers, Trivium entered the studio, with Suecof and Heafy producing again. The band played the Download Festival for a second time, again on the main stage, with Korn and Metallica. Trivium released <i>The Crusade</i> in October 2006. Debuting at number 25 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the album sold over 32,000 copies in its first week of sales. Heafy's vocals had changed from the metalcore scream of the previous albums to clean singing. This new singing style, along with the band's thrash metal music, were criticised as sounding too much like Metallica, who were a major influence on the band.
</p><p>The band supported the album by touring with Iron Maiden and Metallica, appearing on the Black Crusade tour with Machine Head, Arch Enemy, DragonForce and Shadows Fall, as well as headlining a European tour with supporting acts Annihilator and Sanctity and acquiring an opening slot on the Family Values Tour with Korn. Trivium was named the best live band of 2006 at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards.

<p>Trivium started working on a new album with producer Nick Raskulinecz in October 2007. Heafy stated he wanted to bring back the screaming that was found on <i>Ascendancy</i>, and the band said they chose not to work with Suecof again because they already recorded three albums with him and wanted to explore new ideas. Recording ended June 2008.
In an interview with the UK's <i>Metal Hammer</i> magazine in May 2008, Heafy said that their new album was to have "more thrash influences, more screaming." He told Revolver magazine, "For the first time, we can't look at our songs and say who the riffs sound like. We're really making our own stuff and our own kind of music and art form, and that's exciting." In September 2008, Trivium released their fourth full-length album, <i>Shogun</i>. The album sold 24,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as number 1 in the UK Rock Album Charts.
</p><p>Trivium toured extensively throughout 2009 in support of <i>Shogun</i>, with two headline legs of the US, a headline slot on the Mayhem Festival second stage, an Australia/Japan leg, as well as a conclusive UK run in March 2010. Throughout their headline runs, they were supported by Chimaira, Darkest Hour, Dirge Within, Whitechapel, Rise to Remain and Black Tide. They were also booked as a co-headliner for Australia's Soundwave Festival in February 2010.
</p><p>Travis Smith unofficially left the band on the second leg of the "Into the Mouth of Hell We Tour" tour. On February 4, 2010, the band announced that Travis had indeed officially left the band and fill-in drummer, ex-drum tech, Nick Augusto, was replacing him. Augusto is a former member of Maruta and Metal Militia, in which he played with Gregoletto. While Trivium's relationship with Smith had deteriorated over the years, the band had no immediate plans to replace him when he announced in late October 2009 that he would be sitting out the tour to take care of "some personal business." However, Augusto's skill while filling in for the tour convinced the band that he could improve their creativity and live performances.
</p><p>Trivium contributed to the <i>God of War III</i> soundtrack by recording the song, "Shattering the Skies Above". It is exclusively included on <i>God of War: Blood &amp; Metal</i>, a digital EP that comes with the <i>Ultimate Edition</i> of the game and is available from the iTunes Store. The band has also recorded a cover of the song "Slave New World" by Sepultura. "Shattering the Skies Above" was also released exclusively to their fanclub (TriviumWorld) on February 12, 2010 and was released widely on February 15. The next day their Sepultura cover "Slave New World" was released as a free download for members of the UK via Metal Hammer UK. Both of aforementioned songs re-issued on their deluxe version of the album "In Waves".

<p>In an interview with <i>Guitar World</i>, it was stated that for their next studio album, Trivium would "forgo the complex epic compositions, tricked-out leads and seven-string guitars that characterized its past two albums" and instead take an approach similar to that of <i>Ascendancy</i> by using uncluttered riffs, Drop C# tuning, and more straightforward solos. Heafy stated "When we did <i>Ascendancy</i>, we were writing specifically for the songs, not to show how well we could play. That wasn't exactly the case with our next two records." In the bonus content for the November 2011 issue of <i>Guitar World</i>, Heafy said the lower tuning was to make his vocals easier due to the number of concerts the band plays.
</p><p>On June 6, <i>Metal Hammer</i> revealed that the album would be titled <i>In Waves</i> and that it would be released on August 9, 2011. On June 19, Trivium debuted two new songs live in Birmingham entitled "Dusk Dismantled" and "Black". On the June 28, "Dusk Dismantled" was released to TriviumWorld users only; it was released to general public on the 29th. On July 13, the premiere of "Inception of the End" was released to the general public on the website Hot Topic.
</p><p><i>In Waves</i> was released in August 2011 worldwide and received generally positive reviews. Kerrang! described the album as "draws from the band's entire repertoire and shapes what it finds into a defining and definitive set". A special edition was released featuring bonus tracks "Ensnare the Sun", "A Grey So Dark", "Drowning in Slow Motion", the "Slave New World" cover, and the single from the God of War III soundtrack "Shattering the Skies Above".
</p><p>Trivium participated in a co-headlining trek with Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames in both Europe and North America. European support came from Ghost, Rise to Remain and Insense. North American support came from Veil of Maya and Kyng. Additionally, Miss May I and The Ghost Inside joined Trivium during the In Waves 2011 European tour. They also performed at the Metaltown Festival and Download Festival in June 2012. From July 13 to August 28, 2012, Trivium took part in Metal Hammer's "Trespass America Festival" headlined by Five Finger Death Punch with additional support from Battlecross, God Forbid, Pop Evil, Emmure and Killswitch Engage. On October 15, 2012, Trivium commenced a European headlining tour, supported by Caliban, As I Lay Dying and Upon A Burning Body.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style">Musical style</h3>
<p>Trivium has been described as a heavy metal band, and more specifically as metalcore, thrash metal, progressive metal, melodic death metal, groove metal, alternative metal, and power metal.
</p><p>Trivium's music mixes "soaring" and "crushing" riffs, dual guitar harmonies, double bass drum patterns and occasional blast beats and breakdowns typical of the metalcore genre. Vocally, Trivium combines both singing along with heavy screaming and growls. Trivium has been considered one of the notable New wave of American heavy metal acts, having been referred to as one of "big four" bands of the movement, along with Lamb of God, Avenged Sevenfold and Slipknot.
</p><p>Their style has evolved over the years: from their earliest work on <i>Ember to Inferno</i> through <i>In Waves</i>, there is a clear thrash influence from Metallica and Machine Head, as well as a melodic death metal influence from early In Flames.
</p><p>Upon the release of their second album <i>Ascendancy</i>, Trivium were identified as melodic metalcore with strong elements of thrash metal, with the third track on the album "Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr" becoming a permanent fixture in the band's set lists and the rest of the album selling itself to gold status. <i>Ascendancy</i> was even featured as one of Metal Hammer's Albums of the Decade. <i>The Crusade</i> was seen as a major shift in musical direction due to the change in vocal style, namely the absence of screaming, and some of the melodies featured. <i>The Crusade</i> was a much more thrash-oriented album and contained different lyrical themes such as current affairs and famous killings.
</p><p><i>Shogun</i> has a heavy Japanese influence on its title track as well as the first single release "Kirisute Gomen", which translates to "authorization to cut and leave". Acknowledging Matt Heafy's Japanese heritage, the album also was described more favorably as more their own style, as previous references to Trivium sounding like Metallica had been made on the back of <i>The Crusade</i>. <i>The Crusade</i> made sparing use of seven-string guitars, which were featured heavily on <i>Shogun</i>.
</p><p>On <i>In Waves</i>, the band featured a sound closer to <i>Ascendancy</i> than <i>The Crusade</i> and <i>Shogun</i>. Instead of being in drop D like on <i>Ascendancy</i>, the band went half a step lower to drop C#. The album has several songs, such as 'Built to Fall' or 'Dusk Dismantled', featuring mostly clean vocals or solely screamed vocals from Heafy. Seven-string guitars once again returned on <i>Silence in the Snow</i> tuned to B-flat, and have since been used in subsequent albums along with the previously used six-string drop C# tuning, and occasionally seven-string drop G# tuning.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Influences">Influences</h3>
<p>Trivium has stated that they are influenced by musical groups such as Opeth, Nevermore, Dream Theater, Emperor, Slipknot, In Flames, At the Gates, Arch Enemy, Machine Head, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Ozzy Osbourne, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Slayer, Pantera, Dio, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Annihilator, Testament, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Killswitch Engage, Skid Row, Angra, Martyr and Death. In an 2022 interview with <i>Premier Guitar</i>, Heafy stated that the band's early sound was a conscious combination of the sounds of the "metal greats" Megadeth, Metallica, Pantera, Testament and Slayer; Gothenburg melodic death metal, namely In Flames' second through sixth albums; black metal; death metal; and German metalcore, particularly Caliban and Heaven Shall Burn. In a 2024 interview with <i>NME</i>, Heafy additionally claimed that <i>Ascendancy'</i>s influenced were "the classic metal bands that everyone loved alongside melodic death metal, metalcore and emo." He separately asserted that "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist."
</p><p>In an interview with Roadrunner Records, Heafy stated he listened to different types of music during different stages of his life. As a child, he listened to pop punk and ska punk bands like Blink-182, and Reel Big Fish. Heafy also lists bands like Pantera, Slayer, Cryptopsy, Children of Bodom, Dark Tranquillity, Mercenary, Manowar, Armored Saint, Darkthrone, 3 Inches of Blood, Krisiun, Fear Factory, Dimmu Borgir, Dark Funeral, Anorexia Nervosa, Poison the Well, Hatebreed, Yngwie Malmsteen, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Queen, Van Halen, Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever, Depeche Mode, The Beatles, and more.
</p>
<h3 data-mw-anchor="Lyrical_themes">Lyrical themes</h3>

<p>Heafy been the primary lyricist since his early days as a member. He is known for his poetic style of lyrics and the usage of archaic words. Growing up, Heafy experienced anxiety, teenage angst, and occasional thoughts of suicide; several songs from the album <i>Ascendancy</i>, such as "Rain", "Suffocating Sight", and "Departure", deal with these issues. Although not a victim himself, he also wrote the song "A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation" on the topic of domestic violence and child abuse, inspired by the stories of some of his peers.
</p><p>Lyrical themes on the album <i>The Crusade</i> includes famous killings. "Entrance of the Conflagration" is about Andrea Yates's murder of her five children, "Unrepentant" is about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his three daughters and stepdaughter, "Contempt Breeds Contamination" is about the death of Amadou Diallo, and "And Sadness Will Sear" is based upon the murder of Matthew Shepard.
</p><p>Many of the songs on <i>Shogun</i> draw lyrical inspiration from Greek mythology. "Into the Mouth of Hell We March" and "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis" detail the story of Odysseus choosing whether to face the giant whirlpool Charybdis or the six-headed monster Scylla. "He Who Spawned the Furies" is about the Titan Cronos devouring his children and castrating his father Uranus, creating Aphrodite and the Erinýes (the Furies). "Of Prometheus and the Crucifix" references the daily torment of Prometheus and alludes to crucifixion of Jesus. "Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven" is written from the perspective of the nymph Callisto, detailing her rape and impregnation by Zeus and her transformations into a bear and into Ursa Major. Mythological lyrics returned on <i>In the Court of the Dragon</i>. Inspired by fantasy literature, the band made up its own mythology on the album. Lyrical content on <i>The Sin and the Sentence</i> and <i>What the Dead Men Say</i> were inspired by modern aspects of life, such as social media and artificial intelligence as well as general themes such as war, history and religion.
