<p><b>Linkin Park</b> is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's death in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.
</p><p>Categorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, with their later music featuring more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, <i>Hybrid Theory</i> (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling", and "In the End" all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation's <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Their second album, <i>Meteora</i> (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, <i>Minutes to Midnight</i> (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.
</p><p>The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, <i>A Thousand Suns</i> (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, <i>Living Things</i> (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, <i>The Hunting Party</i> (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, <i>One More Light</i> (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's eighth album, <i>From Zero</i> (2024), returned to more of their original sound while also incorporating musical elements from all of their previous records.
</p><p>Linkin Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. <i>Billboard</i> ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared "the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now" by <i>Kerrang!</i>.

<p>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled <i>Xero</i>, released in November 1997. That same month, the band performed their first show, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&amp;R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998 but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.
</p><p>After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Chester Bennington, a vocalist from Arizona who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of alternative rock band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner on a temporary basis. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online "street team". In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band's recordings.
</p><p>The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names "Plear" and "Platinum Lotus Foundation" before deciding on "Linkin Park", a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park"; however, they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".
</p><p>Bennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial recordings. The label's A&amp;R was not pleased with the band's hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&amp;R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for the album. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, <i>Hybrid Theory</i>, that same year.

<p>Linkin Park released <i>Hybrid Theory</i> on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade's worth of the band's work, was edited by Don Gilmore. <i>Hybrid Theory</i> was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001. Singles such as "Crawling" and "One Step Closer" established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year, and "In the End" peaked at No. 2 on the US <i>Billboard Hot 100</i>, the band's highest to date. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as <i>Dracula 2000</i>, <i>Little Nicky</i>, and <i>Valentine</i>. <i>Hybrid Theory</i> won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song "Crawling" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video award for "In the End".
</p><p>During this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, "Linkin Park Underground", in November 2001. Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, <i>Frat Party at the Pankake Festival</i>, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed <i>Reanimation</i>, which would include works from <i>Hybrid Theory</i> and non-album tracks. <i>Reanimation</i> debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. <i>Reanimation</i> claimed the second spot on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. <i>Hybrid Theory</i> is also in the RIAA's <i>Top 100 Albums</i>.

<p>Following the success of <i>Hybrid Theory</i> and <i>Reanimation</i>, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus's studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. <i>Meteora</i> features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003, and instantly earned worldwide recognition, peaking at No. 1 on the Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart.
</p><p><i>Meteora</i> sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best-selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Breaking the Habit", "Faint", and "Numb", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, <i>Meteora</i> sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution tour. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled <i>Live in Texas</i>, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park embarked on the <i>Meteora World Tour</i>.
</p><p><i>Meteora</i> earned the band multiple awards and honors, including Best Rock Video for "Somewhere I Belong" and the Viewer's Choice Award for "Breaking the Habit". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year ("Numb") awards. Although <i>Meteora</i> was not nearly as successful as <i>Hybrid Theory</i>, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records rapidly deteriorated on account of several trust and financial issues. The band finally negotiated a new deal in December 2005.

<p>Linkin Park returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To produce the album, the band chose producer Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the album would debut sometime in 2006, it was delayed until 2007. The band had recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the album was halfway completed. Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous nu metal sound. Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band's third studio album, titled <i>Minutes to Midnight</i>, would be released on May 15, 2007, in the United States. After spending fourteen months working on the album, the band members opted to further refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen tracks. The album's title, a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band's new lyrical themes. <i>Minutes to Midnight</i> sold over 623,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most successful debut week albums in recent years.

<p>Linkin Park went on hiatus following Bennington's death.
</p><p>On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing, "I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it'll take time." On March 29, however, Shinoda stated that he was uncertain of Linkin Park's future when being interviewed by <i>Vulture</i>. On April 17, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards but did not win any of them. The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May 18. On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don't know, almost like unhealthy." When asked about the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, "It's not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester."
</p><p>Shinoda, Farrell and Hahn began working on new music together, without any public announcement; by 2019, they were later rejoined by Delson, but Bourdon chose not to participate. The band met Dead Sara vocalist Emily Armstrong in 2019, and began working on music with her shortly after, along with various other musicians, including drummer Colin Brittain. On April 28, 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music. On August 13, the band released "She Couldn't", a track that was originally recorded in 1999, and it was included on a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album <i>Hybrid Theory</i>, released on October 9. On January 8, 2021, Linkin Park released a remix of "One Step Closer" by American electronic duo 100 gecs. The band revealed it was the first of many new remixes inspired by <i>Reanimation</i> to come. On October 29, when asked about the band playing live shows again, Shinoda stated, "Now is not the time [for the band's return]. We don't have the focus on it. We don't have the math worked out. And I don't mean that by financially math, I mean that like emotional and creative math." In April 2022, Shinoda reiterated that the band was not working on a new album, new music, or touring.
</p><p>In February 2023, the band started an interactive game on their website teasing the 20th anniversary of <i>Meteora</i>. On February 6, they revealed a previously unreleased demo, "Lost", that was formally released on February 10, as the lead single from the reissue of the album, released on April 7. The second single, "Fighting Myself" was released on March 24.

<p>Unbeknownst to the public, in 2023, the band approached Armstrong and Brittain to reform as Linkin Park to record and release new music and perform the band's back catalogue. A previously unreleased song from the <i>One More Light</i> sessions, "Friendly Fire", was released on February 23, 2024. This was followed up by the band's first greatest hits album, <i>Papercuts</i>, which was released on April 12. The collection also includes "Friendly Fire", as well as the first official release of the song "Qwerty", which first appeared on <i>LP Underground 6.0</i> in 2006. On April 30, 2024, <i>Billboard</i> reported that Linkin Park's booking agency WME had taken offers for both a potential reunion tour and headlining festival dates to take place in 2025, with the lineup featuring Shinoda, Delson, Farrell, and a female vocalist in place of Bennington.
</p><p>At a livestreamed event on September 5, Linkin Park announced the band's comeback, including Armstrong and Brittain's entry into the band. In addition, the band performed and released "The Emptiness Machine", the lead single of the group's eighth album <i>From Zero</i>, which was released on November 15, 2024. The band's decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson. The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who had first directed the aforementioned accusations towards Armstrong back in 2023, stated that Linkin Park was "not doing their due diligence before hiring her"; one of Bennington's sons said that Linkin Park "betrayed the trust" of the fanbase with the change. Armstrong responded to the criticism via an Instagram story, stating that she had not been in contact with Masterson since attending his 2020 court appearance and that she condemned his crimes; however, she did not clarify her status with Scientology. Though, BBC noted that the lyrical content she wrote for Dead Sara suggests Armstrong's rejection of their teachings.
</p><p>Linkin Park embarked on a nine-date arena tour across four continents on September 11 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. After Alex Feder performed in his place at the comeback event, Delson announced his decision to withdraw from touring to concentrate on the "behind the scenes" aspects of the band. This initial run of shows concluded in São Paulo, Brazil, on November 16, 2024. Following this, the band announced a worldwide stadium and arena tour for 2025, a tour which included their first ever performance at Wembley Stadium in England. The album's second single, "Heavy Is the Crown", was released on September 24, 2024, and was used as the main theme for Riot Games' 2024 <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship. The album's third single, "Over Each Other", was released on October 24, 2024. The album's fourth single, "Two Faced", was released on November 13, 2024. Not long after the album's release, the band entered the studio again, sharing clips on social media. On March 17, 2025, the band announced a new song titled "Up From the Bottom", released on March 27 as the first single from the deluxe version of <i>From Zero</i>. On April 25, the band released "Unshatter" as the second single of <i>From Zero</i> deluxe. A third song titled "Let You Fade" was released on May 16. On May 31, the band performed during the 2025 UEFA Champions League final at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Linkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop, electronic and hip hop. More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and industrial rock. Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.
</p><p>Both <i>Hybrid Theory</i> and <i>Meteora</i> combine alternative metal, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, and alternative rock sounds with elements of hip hop and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as "a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style," whereas <i>Rolling Stone</i> described their song "Breaking the Habit" as "risky, beautiful art".
</p><p>In <i>Minutes to Midnight,</i> the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process <i>Los Angeles Times</i> compares to a stage in U2's work. Only two songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered as alternative rock.
</p><p>The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda played as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, <i>Minutes to Midnight</i>, Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left". On numerous songs from the band's fourth album, <i>A Thousand Suns</i>, such as the album's singles ("The Catalyst", "Burning in the Skies", "Iridescent"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica. James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead's <i>Kid A</i>, while Jordy Kasko of <i>Review, Rinse, Repeat</i> likened the album to both <i>Kid A</i> and Pink Floyd's landmark album <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>. Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: "Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively". One of the record's political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures. <i>A Thousand Suns</i> was described as trip hop, electronic rock, ambient, alternative rock, industrial rock, experimental rock, rap rock, and progressive rock.
</p><p>Their fifth album, <i>Living Things</i>, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on <i>The Hunting Party</i>, which was described as an alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, rap rock, and rap metal album. Their seventh album, <i>One More Light,</i> was described as pop, pop rock and electropop.
</p><p>Linkin Park's influences include  Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane's Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, Strife, Helmet, and the Beatles.
</p><p>Many of the group's song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion, and personal struggle and suffering.
