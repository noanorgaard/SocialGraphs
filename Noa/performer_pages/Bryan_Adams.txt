<h2 data-mw-anchor="Early_life_and_family">Early life and family</h2>
<p>Bryan Guy Adams was born on November 5, 1959 in Kingston, Ontario. He is the son of Elizabeth Jane (née Watson) and Conrad J. Adams, an English couple who emigrated to Canada from Plymouth, South West England in the 1950s. One of his grandmothers and one of his great-grandmothers were from Malta. His father was a British Army officer who joined the Canadian Army then worked as a United Nations peacekeeping observer and Canadian foreign service diplomat.
</p><p>Adams travelled with his parents to a diplomatic posting in Lisbon, where he attended St. Columban's School. At various points, he and his family also resided in Israel, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Raised in Ottawa, he attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Ottawa. 
</p><p>
Adams bought his first electric guitar at the age of 10 in Reading, an Italian brand from Gherson, based on a Fender Stratocaster. In an interview with music magazine <i>Guitar World</i>, Adams said: </p><blockquote><p>"I bought an imitation Les Paul at a Five and Dime store in Ottawa, Canada, in 1971," Adams recalled. "Before that, I had an imitation Strat which I bought in Reading, England in 1970.
It felt real at the time to have a Les Paul, even though I'm a massive Ritchie Blackmore fan – still am. I was heavily into Humble Pie's <i>Rockin' the Fillmore</i> album at the time, and both Peter Frampton and Steve Marriott were on Les Pauls. It's rock guitar heaven, that album." </p></blockquote>
<p>During his childhood, Adams was sent to a psychiatrist because he was not getting along with his parents. According to Adams, the psychiatrist told him that there was nothing wrong with him and that his parents needed psychiatric help.
</p><p>In 1974, Adams, his mother, and his younger brother Bruce moved to North Vancouver while his father was posted abroad. While there, he attended Argyle Secondary School and Sutherland Secondary School.
</p><p>Adams dropped out of school at age 15. He has said that his worst period of drug abuse including alcohol occurred before his 16th birthday. Once, after Adams had been arrested and thrown in jail, a sergeant said, "'Your mum's come to pick you up, and when you go out there I want you to go and look at her and see how unhappy you are making her'" Adams states that he "'went outside and looked at her, and thought, oh yeah, I can't do this to her anymore'". Adams attributes the pockmarks on his face to his drug use.
</p><p>Adams did not see his father for a period of 12 years following his parents' divorce. He later reconciled with him.

<p>Adams left school to play in a group called "Shock" and used the funds his parents had saved for his college education to buy an Estey grand piano to tinker with. At one point he sold pet food and worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant, which paid the rent. His interest grew in CCR and Deep Purple; he attended concerts by Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, Elton John, and Tina Turner. He began working in the Vancouver music scene with bands and as a studio session singer. At the age of 15, he became the vocalist for glam rock band Sweeney Todd, replacing their original vocalist Nick Gilder.
</p><p>With Adams the band re-recorded "Roxy Roller", the Canadian hit single from their first album, which came in at No. 99 on the US charts. The band then recorded their second album <i>If Wishes Were Horses</i> (1977) with Adams billed as "Bryan Guy Adams" on vocals. Adams left the band at age 16. In 1978, at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver Long and McQuade musical instrument store. Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism, and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later. This became the beginning of a partnership which was prolific and continuous through the 1980s, together they co-wrote for Adams and a long list of recordings for other artists, including Kiss, Tina Turner, Joe Cocker, Johnny Hallyday, Bonnie Raitt, Rod Stewart, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy, Carly Simon and Neil Diamond, and while discontinuous, as of 2017, is still in existence.
</p><p>Later in 1978, Adams signed to A&amp;M records for one dollar. A&amp;M remixed one of Adams' demos as a disco song "Let Me Take You Dancing", featuring Adams' vocals speeded up to meet the 122 BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian <i>RPM</i> chart in March 1979 along with its B-side "Don't Turn Me Away". In 1979, he made an agreement with Canadian manager Bruce Allen, who at that time also worked for Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Loverboy.

<p>Adams's self-titled debut album, mostly co-written with Jim Vallance, was released in February 1980. With the exception of "Remember" and "Wastin' Time", most of the album was recorded in October and November 1979 at Manta Studios and co-produced by Adams and Vallance. The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986. Singles released from it included "Give Me Your Love", "Remember" and "Hidin' from Love", with the latter having the most success, reaching number 64 on the Canadian RPM Current Hit Radio chart; none reached the US Billboard Hot 100.
</p><p>Adams's second album, <i>You Want It You Got It</i>, was released in 1981 and contained the FM album-oriented rock radio hit, "Lonely Nights", which reached number three on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. The same song was reinterpreted by Uriah Heep for the album <i>Head First</i>, released in 1983. The most successful song off the album in Canada was "Fits Ya Good" which reached the top 30 on the RPM Top 40 Chart; it also reached number 15 on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. From January to May 1982, Adams spent months traveling on his "You Want It You Got It Tour"; within a few months the album had been picked up across the United States and Adams was soon on tour opening for the Kinks and Foreigner.
</p><p><i>Cuts Like a Knife</i>, which was released in January 1983, was Adams's breakout album. "Straight from the Heart" was the first single released from the album; it reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 20 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 chart, and number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart. In September 1983, Bonnie Tyler released her version for the studio album <i>Faster Than the Speed of Night</i>. The second single, "Cuts Like a Knife", rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, number six on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart, and number 12 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 Chart. The third single, "This Time", was also a top 30 hit in the US and Canada. Overseas, the latter two singles were both Top 20 hits in New Zealand, but there was little success in any other countries, aside from "Straight From the Heart" and "This Time" reaching the top 50 in the UK. Three other tracks, "Take Me Back", "I'm Ready" and "The Only One", also received substantial airplay on North American rock radio stations, each making the US Album Rock Tracks chart. The album peaked at number eight on both the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart and in Canada, achieving three times platinum status in Canada, platinum status in the United States and gold status in Australia. In October, Adams joined Jim Vallance at the Yamaha Music Festival in Japan. The <i>Music Express</i> national popular opinion poll voted him Canada's best male singer for 1982.

<p><i>Reckless</i> was released in late 1984, and peaked at number one on both the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and the Canadian Album Chart, while reaching number two in Australia and number seven in the UK. The album featured six singles, all of which peaked in the Top 15 of the US Billboard Hot 100, only the third album to achieve this: "Run to You" (number six in the U.S., number 4 in Canada), "Somebody" (number 11 in the U.S.), "Heaven" (number 1 in the U.S., number 11 in Canada), written for the film <i>A Night in Heaven</i>, "Summer of '69" (number 5 in the U.S., number 11 in Canada), "One Night Love Affair" (number 7 in the U.S.), and "It's Only Love" (number 14 in the U.S.), a duet with Tina Turner. The album also did well in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, although "Summer of '69" did not do as well at first in the UK since it was not played often on the radio; however, it achieved success later on in the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium. "It's Only Love" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group in 1986. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance. <i>Reckless</i> also earned Adams a Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Performance. In December 1984, Adams embarked on a two-year world tour to launch the album. The tour included dates with Tina Turner for her Private Dancer Tour. Adams won Juno Awards for Best Male Vocalist in each year from 1983 to 1987. <i>Reckless</i> eventually went Diamond in sales in Canada, the first album by a Canadian artist to do so, while reaching 5× and 3× Platinum in the US and UK. <i>Reckless</i> has sold over 12 million copies worldwide, and won the Juno Award for Album of the Year in 1985.
</p><p>In February 1985, Adams recorded the charity single "Tears Are Not Enough" as a member of The Northern Lights, an improvised supergroup that also included Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, Burton Cummings, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, and other Canadian musical artists.

Nearly 30 years later, Adams released his own version of "Let Me Down Easy" on a 30-year anniversary version of <i>Reckless</i>.
</p><p>In January 1986, Adams provided the ending background vocals to the song "Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)" by Canadian rock band Glass Tiger for their debut album <i>The Thin Red Line</i>. It reached number one in Canada and number two in the United States.

<p>He returned to London and recorded the backing vocals for "Feels Like Forever", a song written by Adams for Eric Carmen. In 1990, he received the Order Of British Columbia.

On July 21, 1990, Adams performed the Pink Floyd tracks "Young Lust" and "Empty Spaces" at Roger Waters's concert production of <i>The Wall – Live In Berlin</i>, to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall eight months earlier.
</p><p>In 1990, in a 45-minute songwriting session, Adams, Robert John "Mutt" Lange, and Michael Kamen wrote "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You" for the <i>Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves</i> soundtrack. Kamen sent his score to a number of different artists before Adams, including Kate Bush who turned the score down. "Everything I Do" was released internationally on June 12, days after the premiere of the film, with the initial shipment of 385,000 copies being the largest single shipment in the history of A&amp;M Records. It spent a record 16 consecutive weeks at Number One on the UK Singles Chart and seven weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100.

</p><p>Adams and Vallance wrote "Nature Of The Beast", originally intended for Tina Turner, but recorded by The Law, featuring Adams on vocals and guitar tracks, in 1991. In May 1991, the music video for the song was created in Sheffield, directed by Julien Temple. In June 1991, a video was shot for the first single, "Can't Stop This Thing We Started", directed by Kevin Godley at Pinewood Studios in London.
</p><p>On September 24, 1991, the album <i>Waking Up the Neighbours</i> was released. Co-produced by Adams and Robert John "Mutt" Lange, it topped the charts around the world, including in the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany and reached number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. It became Adams's second album to be certified Diamond in sales in Canada while being certified 5× platinum in the US. It went on to sell 16 million copies worldwide. <i>Waking up the Neighbors</i> became the first album by a Canadian since Neil Young's 1972 <i>Harvest</i> to reach the top of the album charts in the United Kingdom. The album caused controversy in Canada due to the Canadian content system, as the album was largely recorded in England and co-produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange, originally from Zambia, making it not Canadian by the rules in effect at the time. Following Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that the Canadian content rules would be expanded. The regulation at that time considered collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians to be "Canadian" only where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately and at least one was Canadian. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album was eventually almost completely ignored by the awards committee. In 1992, he won the Juno International Achievement Award, Canadian Entertainer of the Year (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award. In September 1991, the regulation was amended to recognize collaborations in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange.
</p><p>In addition to "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You", the album included "Can't Stop This Thing We Started" (number two in the US and number one in Canada), the ballad "Do I Have to Say the Words?" (number 11 in the US and in the UK and number one in Canada), "Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven" (number 8 in the U.S.), and "There Will Never Be Another Tonight" (number 2 in Canada).

</p><p>
Adams, while writing this song, did not think it would be performed by Aretha. He conceived something like a hymn and "so that it can express a sense of faith, and that even if you have lost something, there will always be an inner light to guide you." However, then Adams said:</p><blockquote><p>"When the song was ready, I told the producers that Aretha was going to sing it – and she did. This solo version had been on my computer for years (about 15 years), and when I heard that the creative director of Sony Music, longtime producer and friend of Aretha's Clive Davis, was making a movie about his life, I sent him this version. The world hadn't heard her full performance yet and it really needed to be heard. I'm so glad it's being released, the world needs this right now."</p></blockquote>

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Artistry">Artistry</h3>
<h4 data-mw-anchor="Voice_and_timbre">Voice and timbre</h4>
<p>Adams' voice has been described as a "sandpaper tenor that's a cross between Joe Cocker and Bruce Springsteen".
</p>
<h4 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style">Musical style</h4>
<p>Adams has played various styles of rock, from hard rock and arena rock to pop rock and soft rock. His early songs were about kids and about the lives of young people, and he is known for his romantic ballads.
</p><p>During the first few years of his career, Adams fronted Canadian glam rock band Sweeney Todd; the band played hard rock as well as glam rock.
</p><p>Adams' first single, "Let Me Take You Dancing", was a disco song. The melody, a piano riff inspired by Robbie King, was composed by Jim Vallance on his parents' piano during the Christmas holidays in 1977; Adams helped turn the riff into a song. 
</p><p>In 1982, Vallance and Adams received a call from producer Michael James Jackson to contribute some songs for the next Kiss album. Although Vallance and Adams were not fans of heavy metal, it was a golden opportunity for exposure for their songs by a world-class rock group. In collaboration with Gene Simmons, the track "War Machine" and a rewrite "Rock 'n Roll Hell" were recorded by Kiss for the album <i>Creatures of the Night</i>. 
</p><p>Adams' first solo albums, <i>Bryan Adams</i> and <i>You Want It You Got It</i>, two clear-cut rock and hard rock albums, included the styles for which Adams would become famous. In 1983, with the release of <i>Cuts Like a Knife</i>, <i>Reckless</i> and <i>Into the Fire</i>, Adams' music was characterised as hard rock with melodic overtones and powerful ballads (known as power ballads).
</p><p>In the 1990s, with the release of <i>Waking Up the Neighbours</i> in 1991, produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange, Adams left the hard rock sound and released an album closer to classic rock and roll, taking inspiration from the sounds of bands like Def Leppard and Foreigner. In 1996, with his album <i>18 til I Die</i>, Adams adopted a pop rock sound more in line with the style of the time. Many ballads were included, although it also contained some rock songs such as "18 til I Die" and "The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You". 
</p><p>In the album <i>Room Service</i> (2000), Adams again opted for a rock-orientated sound. In 2008, with <i>11</i>, Adams utilised a softer sound and included songs from the soft rock, pop rock and melodic rock genres. In 2019, with <i>Shine a Light</i>, he combined rock with pop rock and R&amp;B.
