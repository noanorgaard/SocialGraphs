<p><b>Train</b> is an American pop rock band from San Francisco that formed in 1993. As of 2025, the band consists of Pat Monahan (lead vocals), Taylor Locke (guitar, vocals), Hector Maldonado (bass, vocals), Jerry Becker (keyboards, guitar), and Matt Musty (drums). The band has had many lineup changes, with Monahan serving as the sole constant and sole original founding member.
</p><p>With a lineup that included original members Monahan, Rob Hotchkiss, Jimmy Stafford, Scott Underwood, and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with its debut album, <i>Train</i>. The album was released in 1998 with the hit "Meet Virginia". Train's 2001 album <i>Drops of Jupiter</i> contained the lead single—the RIAA 9× platinum-certified international hit "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)". The single won two Grammy Awards in 2002, and the album was certified double platinum. Train's third studio album, <i>My Private Nation</i>, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit "Calling All Angels". After the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released its fourth album, <i>For Me, It's You</i>, in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a three-year hiatus from recording music.
</p><p>In late 2009, Train regrouped as the trio of Monahan, Stafford, and Underwood to release the album <i>Save Me, San Francisco</i>, from which three singles—the RIAA 13× platinum-certified international hit "Hey, Soul Sister", "If It's Love" and "Marry Me"—reached numbers 3, 34, and 34, respectively, on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The album was certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA. In 2012, Train released <i>California 37</i>. The first single from the album, "Drive By", reached number 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and was a Top 10 hit in the UK. This album was followed by <i>Bulletproof Picasso</i> (2014), <i>Christmas in Tahoe</i> (2015), <i>Train Does Led Zeppelin II</i> (2016), and <i>A Girl, a Bottle, a Boat</i> (2017). Train's most recent studio album, <i>AM Gold</i>, was released in 2022.
</p><p>Train has sold over 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide.

<p>Following the dissolution of his Led Zeppelin cover band "Rogues Gallery", singer Pat Monahan left his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, in late 1993. He resettled in California and crossed paths with Berklee College of Music alumnus Rob Hotchkiss, who performed in coffee houses and local clubs. The two shared lead vocals, with Hotchkiss on guitar and harmonica, and Monahan playing percussion, including a modified conga attached to a kick-drum pedal. Hotchkiss had been the lead singer for L.A.-based Apostles. After deciding to form a full band, the duo recruited Jimmy Stafford (lead guitarist for The Apostles) on guitar, Charlie Colin on bass, and Scott Underwood on drums, thus solidifying Train's lineup in 1994. Train attempted to get signed under Columbia Records in 1996, but were rejected. Subsequently, the band decided to release their first self-titled CD independently. By 1997, they were touring nationally, opening concerts for bands such as Barenaked Ladies, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Cracker and Counting Crows.
