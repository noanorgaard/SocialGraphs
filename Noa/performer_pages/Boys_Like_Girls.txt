<p>The group was formed in Boston suburb Andover, Massachusetts in the final months of 2005, when vocalist Martin Johnson, formerly of the Boston act Fake ID/The Drive, wrote a handful of songs he wanted to record. He recruited bassist Bryan Donahue and drummer John Keefe, whom the latter was in the band Strutter with Johnson when they were in high school. Lead guitarist Paul DiGiovanni was the last member to join, completing the line-up. Some months later Keefe and DiGiovanni learned that they were distant cousins. The group originally performed under the name Lancaster, before later changing their name to Boys Like Girls.
</p><p>The quartet uploaded music to their PureVolume and MySpace page, posting several demo recordings. By the end of the year, the group was on the No. 1 spot on the website's Top Unsigned Artists chart and within a few months had completed nationwide tours with Cute Is What We Aim For, Hit the Lights, All Time Low and Butch Walker.
</p><p>Eventually, in 2006, the popularity of the band was overheard by booking agent Matt Galle and record producer Matt Squire, who contacted the band about a future collaboration. With their full support, Boys Like Girls embarked on their first nationwide tour with A Thorn for Every Heart, Hit the Lights and Keating in late February 2006. Following the month-long venture, the group immediately entered the recording studio with Squire to record their debut album for Columbia Records/Red Ink.
</p><p>During their time in the studio Squire introduced the band to another of his alumni, Cute Is What We Aim For, who offered Boys Like Girls an opening slot on their upcoming headlining tour. Once the album was recorded, Boys Like Girls played back-to-back tours, including the Cute Is What We Aim For tour in June, as well as a two-week stint with Butch Walker in late July. In between tours the band filmed their first music video for their album's lead single, "Hero/Heroine", directed by Mark Serao and Chris Vaglio of Grey Sky Films.

<p>The group began working on their third studio album in 2010. However, it was scrapped after they felt that the album was "disingenuous." According to Johnson, the album originally leaned into an electro-pop hybrid sound and "didn't really feel like Boys Like Girls."
</p><p>In early 2011, rumors started spreading that Boys Like Girls had broken up. Drummer John Keefe was quick to deny these rumors. However, the band's members began working on individual projects. Johnson retreated to Nashville, writing with other musicians and creating demos. Bassist Donahue continued focusing with his side project Early Morning Blues, along with guitarist Paul DiGiovanni. Donahue released the debut EP, <i>Newest Version</i> on December 26, 2010. DiGiovanni has also opened his own clothing range named "Black Carbon Custom" which he runs himself. Keefe began collaborating with the Rebels, a Boston-based band.
</p><p>After writing 300 songs, Johnson believed a "Boys Like Girls album was hiding in there somewhere" and sent the members about 24 tracks. In the fall of 2011, the band reunited at Johnson's home in Los Angeles and used his demos to begin re-working on their third album. They decided to focus on diving into a pop rock and country music sound. On November 19, 2011, the group posted a video announcing they were recording the album. However, the band's bassist Bryan Donahue unwillingly left the band. Reasons told were that Bryan had too many plans disrupting the band's progress and was apparently too "engrossed" in his other solo projects, Early Morning Blues and The Tower and the Fool. Morgan Dorr was announced as Donahue's replacement.
</p><p>The group began recording the album in December 2011, posting studio updates. In May 2012, the band revealed the album's title, <i>Crazy World</i>. On July 17, they released the <i>Crazy World</i> EP, containing three songs off the upcoming full-length album. The three songs are "Be Your Everything", "Life of the Party" and "The First Time". In support of the EP's release, they embarked on the Crazy Good Summer Concert Series with Carly Rae Jepsen on July 19. On August 14, the album's lead single "Be Your Everything" was released along with its music video. In September 2012, the band kicked off a U.S Tour in New Hampshire headlining with The All American Rejects which also featured supporting bands such as Parachute and The Ready Set. On November 4, the band released the album's second single "Life of the Party". On November 8, the album's tracklist was revealed. On November 16, the band premiered the song "Stuck in the Middle", and the LP was made available for pre-order. Days prior to the release of <i>Crazy World</i>, the band released "Leaving California" and "Hey You" for streaming on SoundCloud. The album was officially released on December 11, 2012. The album reached number 134 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Stylistically, the band lists its musical influences as a variety of contemporary band in genres such as punk, emo pop, and alternative rock, such as Jimmy Eat World, Blink-182, Secondhand Serenade, Relient K, The Academy Is..., and Dashboard Confessional. The punk rock influence is most evident in their guitar and drums style. Given Johnson's characteristic tenor vocal melodies, the band's all-around sound is more closely geared to late '90s alternative radio rock, along the lines of Vertical Horizon, Goo Goo Dolls, and Eve 6.
