Since its formation, the band has consisted of guitarist C.J. Pierce, drummer Mike Luce and bassist Stevie Benton, as well as a revolving cast of vocalists.
</p><p>After the release of their debut album, <i>Sinner</i> (2001), original vocalist Dave Williams was found dead on August 14, 2002, from  heart disease. Jason Jones, who replaced Williams in 2003, recorded one album, <i>Desensitized</i> (2004), but left in 2005 due to musical differences. Ryan McCombs of <span>Chicago-based</span> band SOiL, later replaced Jones and released two albums, <i>Full Circle</i> (2007) and <i>Drowning Pool</i> (2010), making it the first time Drowning Pool had not switched singers after just one album. However, McCombs left the band in 2011 to rejoin SOiL. Jasen Moreno was announced as McCombs' replacement in 2012, and the band has recorded three albums with him: <i>Resilience</i> (2013), <i>Hellelujah</i> (2016) and <i>Strike a Nerve</i> (2022). The band continued performing with Moreno until McCombs returned in March 2023.

<h2 data-mw-anchor='Controversy_and_military&apos;s_use_of_"Bodies"' data-mw-fallback-anchor="Controversy_and_military.27s_use_of_.22Bodies.22">Controversy and military's use of "Bodies"</h2>
<p>The band has faced some controversies and criticism due to the alleged misinterpretation of the lyrics to their most well-known song "Bodies". In 2011, the song was associated with the assassination attempt of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Shortly after the shooting, the band made a statement addressing the link: "We were devastated this weekend to learn of the tragic events that occurred in Arizona and that our music has been misinterpreted. 'Bodies' was written about the brotherhood of the moshpit and was never about violence." The band also added: "For someone to put out a video misinterpreting a song about a moshpit as fuel for a violent act shows just how sick they really are. We support those who do what they can to keep America safe. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families of this terrible tragedy".
</p><p>"Bodies" was used consistently by interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps in 2003, and was consistently played over a 10-day period in 2006 during interrogations of Mohamedou Ould Slahi while he was "exposed to variable lighting patterns" at the same time.
