<p>After graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at Kellison Elementary School in Fenton, Missouri. Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer Jay Oliver. He had a studio in the basement of his parents' home in St. Louis and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. Soon after, she sang in commercial jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. She was quoted in a <i>60 Minutes</i> segment as saying she made $40,000 on the McDonald's ad alone.
</p><p>Crow toured with Michael Jackson as a backing vocalist during his Bad World Tour 1987–1989, and often performed with Jackson on "I Just Can't Stop Loving You". She also recorded background vocals for Stevie Wonder, Belinda Carlisle, Jimmy Buffett, Kevin Gilbert and Don Henley. Crow played keyboards and sang backing vocals for Gilbert's band Toy Matinee in the early 1990s.
</p><p>In 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the Neal Schon track "Smoke of the Revolution" from his album <i>Late Nite</i>.

<h3 data-mw-anchor="1992:_Scrapped_debut_album">1992: Scrapped debut album</h3>
<p>In 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with Sting's record producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was due to be released in September 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as "too produced" and "slick". However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion, Tina Turner and Wynonna Judd.

<p>Crow began dating Kevin Gilbert and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the "Tuesday Music Club". The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow; however, it rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after Crow's arrival. Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David &amp; David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, <i>Tuesday Night Music Club</i>, released in 1993. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits. <i>Tuesday Night Music Club</i> featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, "Leaving Las Vegas". The album was slow to garner attention, until "All I Wanna Do" became an unexpected smash hit in October 1994. The singles "Strong Enough" and "Can't Cry Anymore" were also released, with the first song ("Strong Enough") charting at No. 5 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and "Can't Cry Anymore" hitting the Top 40. <i>Tuesday Night Music Club</i> went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the US and UK during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammys at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
</p><p>Crow performed at the 1994 Woodstock Festival and appeared in the "New Faces" section of <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1994. She also supplied background vocals to the song "The Garden of Allah" from Don Henley's 1995 album <i>Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits</i>.
</p><p>In 1996, Crow released her self-titled second album. She produced the album herself and also played a variety of instruments, from various guitars, bass or pedal steel to various organs and piano. The debut single, "If It Makes You Happy", became a radio success and netted her two Grammys for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997. Other singles included "A Change Would Do You Good", "Home", and "Everyday Is a Winding Road". The album was banned from sale at Walmart, because in the lyrics to "Love Is a Good Thing" Crow says that Walmart sells guns to children. The album also features a protest song called "Redemption Day", which was covered by Johnny Cash on his posthumous album <i>American VI: Ain't No Grave</i>.
</p><p>Crow performed at Another Roadside Attraction in 1997. Also in 1997, Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>.

<p>Crow collaborated on Scott Weiland's 1998 album, <i>12 Bar Blues</i>. Also in 1998, Crow released <i>The Globe Sessions</i>. During this period, she discussed in interviews having gone through a deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, "My Favorite Mistake", was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend. Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling <i>Billboard</i> magazine on the release of her album, "Oh, there will be just so much speculation, and because of that there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know. I'm really private about who I've had relationships with, and I don't talk about them in the press. I don't even really talk about them with the people around me." Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, "My favorite single is 'My Favorite Mistake'. It was a lot of fun to record and it's still a lot of fun to play." The album won Best Rock Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow's cover of the Guns N' Roses song "Sweet Child o' Mine", which was included on the soundtrack of the film <i>Big Daddy</i>.

The record featured Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, Keith Richards, and Eric Clapton.

Crow's tenth studio album, <i>Be Myself</i>, was released on April 21, 2017. It was co-produced by Crow, Jeff Trott and Tchad Blake, and is the first time the latter has appeared on one of Crow's studio albums since <i>The Globe Sessions</i> in 1998. <i>Be Myself</i> was described by Crow as a return to the sound of her nineties work, and intentionally eschews the country-influenced sound of her previous album. In an interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Crow said that she did not enjoy the country radio promotional process: "It was more political than I expected... You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that's just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain. I'm too old to allow that for myself, and to spend any night away from my kid for that is not justified."
</p><p>Crow's 2019 album <i>Threads</i> features contributions from, among others, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Sting, Stevie Nicks, Willie Nelson, and Keith Richards. While promoting her UK tour, Crow released "Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You" featuring St. Vincent and revealed that she intended for <i>Threads</i> to be her final album, citing the impossibility of releasing something that could follow-up such a gathering of artists. She added that she would continue to write and tour and would potentially release short-form music akin to extended plays.
</p><p>In 2019, it was reported that Crow was among hundreds of artists whose material had been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Crow had initially told BBC News that the master and safety back-ups for her first seven albums were lost in the fire. However, in a 2022 interview with <i>The Line of Best Fit</i>, Crow revealed that her masters had in fact not been lost, stating that "luckily, they found most of mine in a different area." In 2022, <i>Sheryl</i>, a Showtime documentary film directed by Amy Scott chronicling her career, premiered at the South by Southwest film festival.

<p>Early in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 Gibson Country Western guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked Gibson to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a "Sheryl Crow" model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model. In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition "Sheryl Crow Southern Jumbo", a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.
