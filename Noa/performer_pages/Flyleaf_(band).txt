<p>Early on, Lacey Sturm performed with James Culpepper. Guitarists Jared Hartmann and Sameer Bhattacharya were later recruited. "Sameer and Jared are really experimental with melodies and pedals," said Sturm, "and we all had different influences that were all blending together with the same passionate and hopeful heart, and that brought out this beautiful feeling. It was magical." Bassist Pat Seals joined after leaving his previous band, The Grove.
</p><p>As Passerby, the band released three EPs and played over 100 shows in Texas alone over the span of two years under the booking and promotion company Runt Entertainment. In 2004, Passerby played a showcase for RCA Records in New York City in hopes of getting signed. RCA passed on the band, but the president of Octone Records was very interested. They waited for two days in their van at a truck stop for a phone call about an Octone showcase. They were signed after the showcase, and on January 7, 2004, Octone Records' website announced their arrival to the label.
</p><p>In March 2004, Passerby traveled to Seattle, Washington, to record an EP with producer Rick Parashar. Afterwards, they toured with Skillet, Breaking Benjamin, Staind, and 3 Doors Down to promote their self-titled EP. For legal reasons, they renamed themselves <i>Flyleaf</i> in June 2004. In October, the EP was released to stores (as <i>Flyleaf</i>), spawning their first official single and video for the EP version of "Breathe Today".

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style">Musical style</h2>
<p>Flyleaf has identified under various genres of rock music, including alternative metal, hard rock, alternative rock, post-grunge, nu metal, post-hardcore, and "emo-metal". Because of the many religious references in Flyleaf's music, they are also considered to be a Christian rock band. Despite the numerous genres they have been labeled as, May considered the band to be simply alternative rock, saying, "I think the reason we get put in different genres is because there are so many different influences in the songwriting."
</p>
<h2 data-mw-anchor="Christianity">Christianity</h2>
<p>Lead vocalist Lacey Sturm is a Christian. While faith has influenced the band's music, Sturm said that she does not believe that necessarily makes Flyleaf strictly a Christian band. The band says they are Christians who play in a rock band, and their faith is heard within their music. "We all share the same faith."
</p><p>In November 2006, Flyleaf performed a free concert at Los Angeles Pierce College for a Christian group called The Revolt, which was a three-day event. The band performed a half-hour set Thursday night. It was The Revolt's opening night at Pierce College and the first time the campus has been used as an outdoor music venue.
</p><p>
In a May 2010 interview, Sturm was asked how it felt to be in a Christian rock band and play in Las Vegas: </p><blockquote><p>Well, you know what? I don't know what you mean by a "Christian rock band." It's hard to say that because people all have a different definition of what that means. If it means that we're Christians, then yeah, we're Christians, but if a plumber's a Christian, does that make him a "Christian plumber?" I mean we're not playing for Christians. We're just playing honestly and that's going to come out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former lead vocalist May has felt the band's fans believe she's "not Christian enough" despite professing to be a Christian. She also hopes that people do not discount the band by using the "Christian" label. But despite all this, they're still considered a Christian band in rock world.
</p><p>Although the band relies on themes transcending many faiths and ways of life, they insist being a Christian will always be a part of them and influence their writing.
