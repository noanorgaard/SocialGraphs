<p>Before forming the band, Taylor Momsen was an actress, best known for <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> and <i>Gossip Girl</i>. The band were originally called The Reckless, but changed the name due to trademark problems. The band played its first concert on May 5, 2009, at The Annex in New York. The original lineup of the band consisted of Momsen with John Secolo (guitar), Matt Chiarelli (bass), and Nick Carbone (drums). They recorded some demos in early 2009 and opened for The Veronicas on their North American tour.  For two years, Momsen worked with several producers before meeting Kato Khandwala. Momsen has said that she liked Khandwala because he was a rock producer as opposed to a pop producer. Khandwala introduced Momsen to Ben Phillips, and the three began to write songs. At present, Momsen is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, with Ben Phillips on lead guitar, Jamie Perkins on drums, and Mark Damon on bass.
</p><p>Momsen stated in an interview with <i>OK!</i> magazine that the band signed with Interscope Records and would release their debut album in 2010. After the band announced they had signed to Interscope Records, two new recordings of demo songs ("He Loves You" and "Zombie") were posted on their Myspace account.
</p><p>On December 30, 2009, the band released a new promo song entitled "Make Me Wanna Die". The song was a limited-time free download for fans on their Interscope Records website. The band launched "Make Me Wanna Die" on the soundtrack and it appeared in the end credits of the 2010 film <i>Kick-Ass</i>. The song was the band's first single, released on May 17, 2010, with the debut album set to be released in August. They performed at <i>The Bamboozle</i> music festival on May 1, 2010. The band played Warped Tour 2010.
</p><p>Their first EP was released on June 22, 2010, to mixed reactions. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine classified the sound as "generic". It contained four songs, three of which can be found on their debut album: "Make Me Wanna Die", "My Medicine", and "Goin' Down". "Make Me Wanna Die" was released on April 14, 2010 as the lead single from <i>Light Me Up</i>. A viral video was released to promote the single. The full record was released on August 31, 2010. "Miss Nothing" was released on the second single on August 18, 2010. A video for "Miss Nothing" was released on July 20, 2010. In August 2010, the band performed at the V Festival in the UK.

The band opened for Evanescence at the historic Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Evanescence singer Amy Lee told MTV News about Momsen: "She's got a great voice; she's real sweet", and laughingly said that being one of Momsen's first concerts makes her feel "old, but very, very flattered." Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy Tour confirmed The Pretty Reckless as an opening act for three tour dates in November 2011.
</p><p>In 2012, two singles were released from the album: "You" and "My Medicine". Videos for both singles were also released: "You" featuring Momsen in a small empty apartment playing the guitar, and "My Medicine" featuring Momsen at an out-of-control party as she sings about being under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Later in 2012, she appeared in a video completely naked. In the video entitled "The Words - Under The Water", Momsen appeared in a black-and-white film while saying the lyrics like reciting a poem. By the time the video ends, Momsen appears without her clothes on, although her private parts are blurred.

Writing for the band's third album began shortly after the completion of two years of touring in support of the band's second studio album, <i>Going to Hell</i> (2014). </p><blockquote><p>"We had so much we wanted to say, it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal", Momsen said. "The touring life is very isolating. You look at the world through a bus or airplane window. But music is the healing factor. It's the one thing that is grounding and a true companion through the forest. It saved us—again." </p></blockquote><p>The band released "Take Me Down" as the lead single for their third studio album on July 15, 2016. It became the band's fourth single to top the Mainstream Rock chart and was serviced to US active rock radio on July 19. The music video for "Take Me Down" was released on September 29, 2016.

</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>"That was the nail in the coffin for me. I threw my hands up in the air and kind of went 'Yeah, I give up.' I went down a very dark rabbit hole of depression and substance abuse and everything that comes with that."</p></blockquote>
<p>In November 2019, Momsen revealed on Instagram that the band was working on their fourth studio album with Matt Cameron of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.

Momsen stated that the song comments on the world's current "civil unrest": "The world has been in such a state of civil unrest. 'And So It Went' basically comes from that vision. As a songwriter, I feel like I'm not here to preach. I use music to observe and communicate what I see around me." The album was released on February 12, 2021.
</p><p>The band returned to touring for the first time since the Who You Selling For Tour when they joined Shinedown on their Revolutions Live Tour.
