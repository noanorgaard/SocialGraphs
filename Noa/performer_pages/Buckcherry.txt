<p><b>Buckcherry</b> is an American hard rock band from Anaheim, California, formed in 1995. The band released two albums, <i>Buckcherry</i> (1999) and <i>Time Bomb</i> (2001), before dissolving in 2002. Buckcherry's first album <i>Buckcherry</i> was DreamWorks' first album to go gold. In 2005, lead vocalist Josh Todd and lead guitarist Keith Nelson reformed Buckcherry with a new lineup and released a new album in 2006, <i>15</i>. It contained Buckcherry's biggest crossover hits to date, "Crazy Bitch", and their first <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 top ten hit, "Sorry". The band continued to record albums, releasing seven between 2008 and 2023: <i>Black Butterfly</i> in 2008, <i>All Night Long</i> in 2010, <i>Confessions</i> in 2013, <i>Rock 'n' Roll</i> in 2015, <i>Warpaint</i> in 2019, <i>Hellbound</i> in 2021 and <i>Vol. 10</i> in 2023. Their eleventh album, <i>Roar Like Thunder</i> was released in June 2025.

<p>Josh Todd grew up in the Anaheim Hills neighborhood of Anaheim, California and later moved to Lake Forest, California. Early on, Todd fronted the Hollywood glam rock band Slamhound. He eventually met lead guitarist Keith Nelson through their tattoo artist (Kevin Quinn). The duo made a few demos before being joined by bassist Jonathan Brightman and drummer Devon Glenn, calling themselves Sparrow. Sparrow began performing around the Hollywood club scene, receiving a strong, local following due to their old school rock and roll vibe, and were signed to DreamWorks Records shortly after. The group changed its name to Buckcherry after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from a record label called Sparrow (owned by EMI). Although the band's name is a spoonerism of the late Chuck Berry, the group said it was inspired by a drag queen acquaintance of theirs named Buck Cherry.

<p>The band released its self-titled debut in 1999 to critical praise and certified gold sales. The album, produced by Terry Date (Soundgarden/Mother Love Bone/Pantera/Steve Jones/Deftones), included the hit singles "Lit Up", "For the Movies", "Dead Again", and "Check Your Head".
</p><p>After adding rhythm guitarist Yogi Lonich to the lineup in 1999, Buckcherry toured nonstop in support of the debut album, including opening for Lenny Kravitz on his Freedom Tour (1999) and participating at the infamous Woodstock 99, before going back into the studio in 2000 to work on a follow-up, <i>Time Bomb</i> (2001). The second album was considered a disappointment by many critics, and it did not fare as well on the charts. Allmusic noted that "For a second record, it's surprising how jaded and nihilistic they are already."
Buckcherry performed opening dates for AC/DC in the spring of 2000. From August 2001 through January 2002, as tension over the musical direction set in, Jonathan Brightman, Yogi Lonich, and Devon Glenn each successively left Buckcherry, and were replaced by Dave Markasky, Josh Fleeger, and Matt Lawrence, respectively. Josh Todd and Keith Nelson still planned to continue the band, and began the writing process for a third album. The album was never completed, however, and the band was put on hiatus in July 2002.

<p>Josh Todd and Keith Nelson performed together along with ex-Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum (also of The Cult) at the Randy Castillo tribute concert. Speculation ensued that Josh Todd would become the lead vocalist of the project headed up by Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum. Josh Todd spent a month in the studio, reportedly completing 10 songs, but was abruptly dropped from the project by Slash. Todd was quoted as saying, "It was amazing, the band was slamming, and then Slash just came in one day and just shit-canned the whole thing". In his autobiography, Slash says the reason was because he was displeased with how Todd's voice sounded when they played the material back. Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots was eventually chosen to helm the band that would become known as Velvet Revolver. Keith Nelson was given a songwriting credit on Velvet Revolver's track "Dirty Little Thing". Nelson then went on to write and produce on various records.

According to sources, however, all participants in the Crazy Bitch video had to show proof that they were over eighteen years old and sign a release form further reaffirming their age. Band attorney Skip Miller is quoted in several news stories as stating, "This woman filled out a release form with false information. And once it was determined this woman was underage, the video was removed."
