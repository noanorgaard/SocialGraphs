They have released three consecutive number-one albums (<i>Faceless</i>, <i>IV</i> and <i>The Oracle</i>) on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and have had 25 top-ten rock radio hits and 12 at number one.

<p>In February 1995, Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind. His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo. The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston. Locally popular songs such as "Keep Away" and "Whatever" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.
</p><p>
The band's name does not derive from the Alice in Chains song of the same name;  according to Erna, the name instead came from an incident where he developed a cold sore shortly after a former bandmate did:</p><blockquote><p>"I was making fun of [our drummer at the time] who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a god smack.' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice In Chains song but didn't really think much about it." </p></blockquote><p>In 1996, Tony Rombola joined as the guitarist after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered New Alliance Studio in Boston to record its debut album, <i>All Wound Up...</i>. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600 and was self-released in February 1997 through the band's own record label, E. K. Records Company. In May 1997, Joe D'Arco joined to replace Stewart on drums.
</p><p>Eventually, Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put "Keep Away" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off." In April 1998, D'Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer Tommy Stewart, who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.

<p>In June 1998, Universal/Republic Records signed the band to their label.  The band's first album <i>All Wound Up...</i> was slightly edited to remove unlicensed samples, fully re-mastered and given a new artwork and layout; the finished self-titled album <i>Godsmack</i> was released to the public six weeks later on August 25, 1998. This led to the band's first headlining tour, "The Godsmack Tour" with Jim Rose Circus as the opening act. After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at Ozzfest and Woodstock '99. This was followed by a tour in Europe supporting Black Sabbath. Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating, "Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age". The album entered the <i>Billboard</i> 200 at number twenty-two, and was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2024 after being initially certified gold in 1999.
</p><p>The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine stating, "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint ... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective ... We have decided to put a sticker on the record." This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped; "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it." The album also had four successful singles which were "Whatever", "Keep Away", "Voodoo" and "Bad Religion".

<h3 data-mw-anchor="Awake_(2000–2001)" data-mw-fallback-anchor="Awake_.282000.E2.80.932001.29"><i>Awake</i> (2000–2001)</h3>

<p>In 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of <i>Godsmack</i> to start recording <i>Awake</i>. The album was released on <span>October 31</span>, 2000. The album debuted at number five on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and has been certified 2× platinum by the RIAA. "Vampires", a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of <i>Awake</i>, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, "We've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of <i>Awake</i> was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. "Ozzfest" was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own." The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999. On July 19, 2001, Godsmack released their first live DVD titled <i>Live</i>. The DVD has since been certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 50,000 copies in the United States.
</p><p>Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials ("Sick of Life" and "Awake") as background music. Erna stated, "Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted". However, Erna insisted in an interview that Godsmack does not support any war.

<p>In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to <i>The Scorpion King</i>. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled "I Stand Alone" and the song became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight. It was also used in the game <i>Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</i>.
</p><p>With Shannon Larkin (ex Ugly Kid Joe, Souls at Zero, Wrathchild America, MF Pitbulls) replacing Tommy Stewart, who left due to personal differences for the second time, Godsmack went back into the studio later that year to record a new album that was released in 2003. <i>Faceless</i> debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States. <i>Faceless</i> also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.
</p><p>The lead single "Straight Out of Line" received a Grammy Award nomination for "Best Hard Rock Performance". The award went to Evanescence's single "Bring Me to Life". The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident. However, in a later interview Merrill stated otherwise, making it unclear of how the album's title came to be, "It came from the band's feeling that, despite our radio and sales success, we still flew a bit under the radar".
</p><p>On March 16, 2004 <i>The Other Side</i>, an acoustic EP, was released. The album debuted at number five on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, a relatively high position for an acoustic EP. It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks. One new song, "Touché", featured Godsmack's first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John Kosco, who were at that time in the now defunct band Dropbox, The other two new acoustic tracks were "Running Blind" and "Voices". The song "Asleep" is actually an acoustic version of "Awake" from the band's second album <i>Awake</i>. Godsmack shifted from its "heavy" sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on this EP in the same manner Alice in Chains did in the <i>Sap</i> and <i>Jar of Flies</i> EPs, one of many similarities to Alice in Chains for which the band has been criticized.
</p><p>In 2004, Godsmack opened for Metallica's "Madly in Anger with the World tour", and headlined the tour along with Dropbox. Afterwards, in autumn 2004, the band played several acoustic shows to promote <i>The Other Side</i>, while at the same time continuing to open for Metallica.

<p>Throughout 2006, The band was in the studio recording and writing material for a new album. On April 25, 2006, Godsmack released its fourth studio album simply titled <i>IV</i>, followed by a tour that would continue until January 2008, titled "The IV tour". The album was produced by Erna and engineered by the well known producer and engineer Andy Johns, known for engineering Led Zeppelin's <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i>. The first single from the album, "Speak" was released on <span>February 14</span>, 2006. The album debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling 211,000 copies in its first week.
</p><p><i>IV</i> has since been certified gold. The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, "it's Sully's band and his vision.[...]When it comes time to pick the songs it's all Sully". The album's minimalist name "IV" derives not only from its being the band's fourth studio album, but also from a running piece of backstage humor, as related by Larkin and Erna in an interview.
</p><p>To celebrate ten years as a band, Godsmack released a greatest hits album entitled <i>Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack</i> on <span>December 4</span>, 2007. The album debuted at number thirty-five on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, selling 40,000 copies in the first week of release. It includes a cover of the Led Zeppelin song "Good Times Bad Times", as well as a DVD of Godsmack's acoustic performance in Las Vegas at House of Blues. The album was originally intended to be a boxed set, but the band scrapped the plans so they could release a best of album. Godsmack will follow the release of the album with an acoustic tour. Despite rumors of the band going on hiatus as a result of releasing a greatest hits album, Erna was quoted as saying, "we're not going away, we are just gonna take a break and enjoy our 10th year anniversary and kind of recharge our batteries. And then Godsmack will be back, and we will come back bigger and badder than ever."

<p>In November 2008, Larkin announced that the band would be reforming and recording a new album. The following summer, the band toured as support to Mötley Crüe's Crüe Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, "Whiskey Hangover". After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled <i>The Oracle</i> was released on <span>May 4</span>, 2010. Arriving to popular reception, <i>The Oracle</i> was Godsmack's third straight full-length studio album to debut at No. 1 with 117,000 sold in the first week of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, "It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's going to be any 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!".
</p><p>Godsmack headlined the fourth annual Mayhem Festival alongside Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers for an upcoming release. They then went on tour in the spring with Staind. In February 2012, Godsmack finished an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album <i>Live &amp; Inspired</i> on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks.

A month after, Erna announced a short solo tour through America.

<h2 data-mw-anchor="Musical_style_and_influences">Musical style and influences</h2>

<p>Godsmack emerged as part of the post-grunge, and nu metal movements in the late 1990s, and has been described as alternative metal, hard rock, and heavy metal. The band's primary influences include Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Pantera and Rush according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola. Erna credits Layne Staley with inspiring him to start singing, and considers James Hetfield as a primary influence.
</p><p>The overall sound of the band's first two albums have been compared to Alice in Chains' album <i>Dirt</i>. However, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, "I've just never really heard that in our music."
</p><p>The band's music is often compared to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence. Adrien Begrand of <i>PopMatters</i> states, "Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley's low, guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls" and, "The band's music is a faithful retread of Jerry Cantrell's churning, tuned-down hard rock".
</p><p>Erna's singing style has been stated as "the snarl of James Hetfield", and "composed of dark harmony that sounds a lot like Alice in Chains". Merrill's bass style has been described as "bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb". Larkin's drumming is thought to "worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham". And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as "guitars that sound like percussion instruments".
