top down\\nSaw you switchin\\' lanes, girl\\nPull up to the red light, lookin\\' right\\nCome here, let me get your name, girl\\nTell me where you\\'re from, what you do, what you like\\nLet me pick your brain, girl\\nAnd tell me how they got that pretty little face\\nOn that pretty little frame, girl\\nBut let me show you \\'round, let me take you out\\nBet you we could have some fun, girl\\n\\'Cause we can do it fast, fast, slow\\nWhichever way you wanna run, girl\\nBut lеt me buy you drinks, better yеt, rings\\nDo it how you want it done, girl\\nAnd who would\\'ve thought that you could be the one? \\'Cause I\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to fall in love with you\\nYou can\\'t wait to fall in love with me\\nThis just can\\'t be summer love, you\\'ll see\\nThis just can\\'t be summer love (L-O-V-E)\\n\\nCome on and lemme show you \\'round, let me take you out\\nBet you we could have some fun, girl\\n\\'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down\\nAny way you want it done, girl\\nOr we can stay home, talkin\\' on the phone\\nRappin\\' \\'til we see the sun, girl\\nDo what I gotta do\\nJust gotta show you that I\\'m the one, girl\\nWell, I\\'ma freak you right each and every night\\nI know how to do it insane, girl\\n\\'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop\\nMake you wanna say my name, girl\\nCome on, baby, please, \\'cause I\\'m on my knees\\nCan\\'t get you off my brain, girl\\nBut who would\\'ve thought that you could be the one? \\'Cause I\\nYou might also like\\nI can\\'t wait to fall in love with you\\nYou can\\'t wait to fall in love with me\\nThis just

    "- Filter playlists: If any song in a playlist cannot be found on Genius, discard the entire playlist.\n",
    "- Fetch lyrics: Use the Genius API to get lyrics for each unique song per artist.\n",
    "- Concatenate lyrics per artist: Combine lyrics for all unique songs by that artist into one text block.\n",
    "- Save to .txt files: Store each artist’s lyrics in a separate file so you can load them later without re-scraping.\n",
    "- Attach lyrics as an attribute in the graph: When building the NetworkX graph, add the lyrics as a node attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations\n",
    "- Avoid duplicates: Only fetch lyrics for unique songs per artist.\n",
    "- Rate limits: Genius API has limits, so you may need to add delays or caching.\n",
    "- Error handling: If any song in a playlist fails, skip that playlist entirely.\n",
    "- File structure: Use a folder like artist_lyrics/ to store .txt files named after the artist."
