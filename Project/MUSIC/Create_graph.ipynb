in taking chances\\nBut who am I to say\\nWhat a girl is to do?\\nGod, I need some answers\\nWhat am I to do with my life?\\n(You will find it out don\\'t worry)\\nHow am I supposed to know what\\'s right?\\n(You just got to do it your way)\\nI can\\'t help the way I feel\\nBut my life has been so overprotected\\nI\\'ll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don\\'t\\nBut every time I do I stand corrected\\nThings that I\\'ve been told\\nI can\\'t believe what I hear about the world, I realize\\nI\\'m overprotected\\nYou might also likeThere must be another way\\nCause I believe in

    "\n",
    "- Filter playlists: If any song in a playlist cannot be found on Genius, discard the entire playlist.\n",
    "- Fetch lyrics: Use the Genius API to get lyrics for each unique song per artist.\n",
    "- Concatenate lyrics per artist: Combine lyrics for all unique songs by that artist into one text block.\n",
    "- Save to .txt files: Store each artist’s lyrics in a separate file so you can load them later without re-scraping.\n",
    "- Attach lyrics as an attribute in the graph: When building the NetworkX graph, add the lyrics as a node attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations\n",
    "- Avoid duplicates: Only fetch lyrics for unique songs per artist.\n",
    "- Rate limits: Genius API has limits, so you may need to add delays or caching.\n",
    "- Error handling: If any song in a playlist fails, skip that playlist entirely.\n",
    "- File structure: Use a folder like artist_lyrics/ to store .txt files named after the artist."
