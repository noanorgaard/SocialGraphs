Oh, oh-oh

For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, "It's time to sink or swim"
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, woah-woah
Runnin' a thousand miles just get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, coming from you I admit I'd
Rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody

Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, coming from you I admit I'd
Rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love (Oh, oh, no, no, no, no)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love (Oh-oh-oh)
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(Somebody to love)
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(I just need somebody to love)

And you can have it all
Anything you want, I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find
'Cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh-oh, find me somebody to love, oh-oh

I just need somebody to love (Yeah)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(Somebody to love)
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(I swear, I just need somebody to love)

I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody (To love), I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love

When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin', 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone), I'm gone
