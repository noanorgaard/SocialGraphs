It's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go
No one will know, oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patrón and it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
Oh

(Ooh) I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing like, "Ooh"
(Ooh) So what you wanna do? Let's just run, girl
(Ooh) If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
(Ooh) No, I won't blame you, it was fun, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you

Just say, "I do"
Tell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say, "I do"
Tell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby, oh

It's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
(Ooh) Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
(Ooh) Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
