(Woo, woo-ooh, woo)

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high, I touched the clouds
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
(Two, three, four)

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) Woo
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo)

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo)
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo)

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (Soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (Control)

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo)

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life (Woo, woo-ooh, woo)
Everything is lookin' up, everybody up now
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
