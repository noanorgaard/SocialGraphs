Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key (Low-key)
'Cause you know how it is (Hey, hey)

From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay)
Conversation got heavy (
Hey

She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out! (Oh)

She was sayin', "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor

'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now; oh, let's go)
Now I gotta keep it real now (Yeah)
'Cause on a one-to-ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey)
'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me (Hey, hey, hey)
The way she get low
I'm like, "Yeah, just work that out for me"

So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then

If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (

When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand?
Let's drink, you the one to please (

Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (My boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (It's alright, girl, that's okay)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (My boo, that's my baby)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (I can't hide it, my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life (Yeah, yeah)
You will always be my boo

Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
