Believe me, it ain't easy for me to tell you how much I still need your love
I'm sinking and a'thinking are you living the life we were dreaming of

'Cause now you're someone else's problem
But I wish that you were mine
And I'm one more sip away from calling
Maybe we can solve it

I know I didn't make it wrong
But I didn't make it right
I can make it better by holding you tonight
And I don't need to use my words to show you I'm f'real
So if you want me, show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Don't tell me, show me how you feel

Boy, I'd be a liar if I told you I didn't want you anymore
It's four in the morning and I try not to cry when you show up at my door

'Cause you still got all of your problems
And you know I've got mine
But, baby, I think we can solve 'em
Just touch me, darling

I know I didn't make it wrong
But I didn't make it right
I can make it better by holding you tonight
And I don't need to use my words to show you I'm f'real
So if you want me, show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel
Don't tell me, show me how you feel

Show me how you feel
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel

I know I didn't make it wrong
But I didn't make it right
I can make it better by holding you tonight
And I don't need to use my words to show you I'm f'real
So if you want me, show me how you feel, baby
Show me how you feel, show me
Show me how you feel
Show me how you feel

Show me how you feel, baby
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel
I want you to show me
Show me how you feel, show me
Show me how you feel
