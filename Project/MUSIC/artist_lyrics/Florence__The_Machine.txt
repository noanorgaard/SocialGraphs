Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
Here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

And good God
Under starless skies we are lost
And into the breach we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

I'd already had a sip
So I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

And with one kiss
(And with one kiss)
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
(For twenty years)
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should have known better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

The dog days are over
The dog days are done (Here they come)
The horses are coming
So you better run (Here they come)
The dog days are over
The dog days are done (Here they come)
The horses are coming
So you better run
