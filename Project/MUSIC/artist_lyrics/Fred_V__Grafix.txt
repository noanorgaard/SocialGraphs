Uncloud my mind
Take me high beyond the sky into the night
It's time to go
Beyond the crowds to the outside of the unknown

When you are here
The past and future are just ideas
You take me beyond the peaks where I can't breathe, I can't breathe

I can't see the ground 'cause we're so high
I can't breathe but somehow I feel so alive
I can't see the ground 'cause we're so high
I can't breathe but somehow I feel so alive

When you are here
The past and future are just ideas
You take me beyond the peaks where I can't breathe, I can't breathe

I can't see the ground 'cause we're so high
I can't breathe but somehow I feel so alive
I can't see the ground 'cause we're so high
I can't breathe but somehow I feel so alive

I can't see the ground 'cause we're so high
I can't breathe but oh, I feel so alive
