We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

Mean man, promised land
Nothing but a devil's hand
Trying to keep saying I feel okay
Telling myself this now for days

Mean man, machine man
I've been nothing but a puppets hand
But nothing ever comes
Without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
La la, love you

Been wondering, I take a chance
That chance is circumstance
Cause nothing ever comes without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

Yeah, I've figured it out, I've seen the unknown
Like a shot in the dark, I'll carry you home
Ask a wise man
He'll say what's been done
All the roads in this world
Were made by the young, by the young

Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

Welcome to your, welcome to your
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah
Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, oh yeah
Oh

Ooh
Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now, oh yeah

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

Oh, take me to your best friend's house
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue-tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party, pillow fight
My eyes on your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats 'til beddy-bye

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't, oh

Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
(All right, all right, all right)

A-don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't wave bye)
Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't
Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't wave bye)
Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
