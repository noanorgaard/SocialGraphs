Show me
What it means to be yours
What it means to be more, more
What it means to be more, ah
Show me
What a difference you make
What a word that you say now could mean when it's over, and it comes time for change

Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

Show me
How to get what you give
How to let go and live, live
How to let go and live, ah
Show me
What a life this could be
What a promise you make now could mean when the day comes, that everything you see
Is without me

Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you

Cause I'm gonna miss you
