I've been waiting half my life
Just to be the one to take you home tonight
We can make it if we try
But I wanna wait until the time is right

Tell me what's on your mind
I can't get you off mine
Are we over or meant to be?
Don't need to know right now
Timing will work it out
Can't let you make those mistakes with me

So don't let someone find you until you find yourself
So don't let someone find you until you find yourself

Did I lose you? I can change
But you're free to turn and walk the other way
I won't bruise you either way
I don't know if there will be another day

Tell me what's on your mind
I can't get you off mine
Are we over or meant to be?
Don't need to know right now
Timing will work it out
Can't let you make those mistakes with me

So don't let someone find you until you find yourself
So don't let someone find you until you find yourself

Tell me what's on your mind
I can't get you off mine
Are we over or meant to be?
Don't need to know right now
Timing will work it out
Can't let you make those mistakes with me

So don't let someone find you until you find yourself
So don't let someone find you until you find yourself

So don't let someone find you until you find yourself
So don't let someone find you until you find yourself
