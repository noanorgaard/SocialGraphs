I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?"
"She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song, and I feel all right (Hey, hey)

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Ooh, yeah)
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)

I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowin' when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait) Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah
I, I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait) That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah
I, I can't wait to see you again

I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-woah-woah
I, I can't wait to see you again

(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-woah-woah
I, I can't wait to see you again
