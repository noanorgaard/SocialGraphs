When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
"There's only one girl in this world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti"

Go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical, moonlit night
Because nobody's talking 'bout you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Hey!)

Am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl?
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sun-swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Woo!)

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
(Oh! Go!)
Baby, you should know by now that I'm right for you
But every time I step to you, you change your tune
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holdin' our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left
And there's no one else I'd rather die to myself

Oh, why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been trippin' over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Maybe I should pack my things and move on
Maybe I'm foolin' myself and you're already gone
Watchin' the flames wither and fade
Tryin' to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down on my knees, just prayin' that I can hold on

Oh, why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm learning to unwind
I've been trippin' over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Baby, please, oh baby, please
Stay with me or cut me free
It’s killin' me

Oh, why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been trippin' over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it
