Having hallucinations
I'm losing sleep every night
Keep trying to cover my eyes
My eyes, yeah
Is it my imagination?
I think I'm losing my mind
Still see your face all the time
All the time

Tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
Yeah, that's all I want
And night after night after night I'm still haunted
I'm haunted, baby
I'm haunted by you, you
Fall asleep and dream of you, you
Late at night I scream for you, you
Waiting on a déjà-vu
But until then

I live with hallucinations
They're just hallucinations
I'll just hallucinate
'Cause you're not here
Hallucinations

Losing my concentration
Hearing your voice in my head
Seeing you when you aren't there
You're not there
And I can't keep living like this
Something's gotta give (Give me you)
If I could make it all go away
Then I would

Tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
Yeah, that's all I want
And night after night after night I'm still haunted
I'm haunted, baby
I'm haunted by you, you
Fall asleep and dream of you, you
Late at night I scream for you, you
Waiting on a déjà-vu
But until then

I live with hallucinations
(Fall asleep and dream of you, you)
They're just hallucinations
(Late at night I scream for you, you)
I'll just hallucinate
(Waiting on a déjà-vu)
'Cause you're not here
Hallucinations
