I know you think you can't trust me
And I know that maybe you're right
Cuz I came and went
I left you again
With a wound you cannot hide
You caught me out in the open
You drew a bead on my heart
But you come and go
You reap what you sew
Never finish what you start
______________________________________
Set the trap
Fall back
To the trees
You're my favorite one to fight
Such a beautiful machine
Cover tracks
Never fall asleep
We could do this all night
We'll never break from this cycle
•
Now
•
Our double helix will spiral
•
Down
•
Keep low
And wait for you to lead
You're my favorite one to fight
Such a beautiful machine
______________________________________
Too late for making amends now
Too far to throw in reverse
So we spoke our piece
Then spread our disease
Over every inch of dirt
You wouldn't be taken hostage
And I wouldn't lay down and bleed
So we cut the ties
Said fuck the disguise
Never trust what you can't see

•
Now
•
Our double helix will spiral
•
Down
•
Can't hide
Burned through all the leaves
•
Used up everything we had
•
Brought the forest to it's knees
