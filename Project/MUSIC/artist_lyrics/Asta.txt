Been taking my time not thinking about you
Just walking my mind, walking my mind
Yeah, I could call but I know I don't have to
'Cause I'm doing alright, feeling alright

But I'm affected by your energy wave
Like dynamite, we exploding, you take me away
You eject me in to outer space
You been lighting me up, you been lighting me up, babe

(Three, two, one, six, seven, eight, nine)
Ooh, girl, you got that magic
Put boys in a constant panic
Combat boots and a combat jacket
Drinking every night, eating all organic
Tomboy, you could be Tom's girl if you want, girl
Tell me what you want, girl
Bookshelf full of Philip K. Dick and Orwell
So of course I fell, I'm only mortal
Your addictions, contradictions
Always lying, politicians
For a rich girl, poor decisions
But when you visit, it's all forgiven
And you know I'm feeling strong for ya
I mean honey, I'd accompany ya
I make you sing like the opera
And your body go la-la-la, yeah, la-la-la

But I'm affected by your energy wave
Like dynamite, we exploding, you take me away
You eject me in to outer space
You been lighting me up, you been lighting me up, babe
But I'm affected by your energy wave
Like dynamite, we exploding, you take me away
You eject me in to outer space
You been lighting me up, you been lighting me up, babe

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
(You been lighting me up)

I don't mean to be gooey
But girl, you make me wanna go gabooey, boom
Cutie, I think I want your cooties
So stop not doing me and do me
Catch us in the club, dancing to "Juicy"
You're lying on the roof of your house like Snoopy
We're having fun all the time, all the time is fun
I sort of kind of reckon that you might be, like, the one

But I'm affected by your energy wave
Like dynamite, we exploding, you take me away
You eject me in to outer space
You been lighting me up, you been lighting me up, babe
But I'm affected by your energy wave
Like dynamite, we exploding, you take me away
You eject me in to outer space
You been lighting me up, you been lighting me up, babe

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
(You been lighting me up)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
(You been lighting me up)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Now I am feeling the force
'Cause  task, 
Now I am feeling the force
'Cause  task, 
Now I am feeling the force

Now I am feeling the force
