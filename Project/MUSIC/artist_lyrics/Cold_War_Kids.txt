And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
'Cause I'm a red blooded man
When I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

To believe again
To believe again
Cheated and lied, broken so bad
You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull
First you get close, then you get worried

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

You're going silent, the silent treatment
It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant
You get excited, you get excited
You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You get excited, you get excited

Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first

First you get close, then you get worried
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
