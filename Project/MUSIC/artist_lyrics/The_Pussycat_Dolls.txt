You say you're a big boy, but I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder (Wonder) if I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder) if my kiss don't make you just wonder (Wonder)
What I got next for you, what you wanna do? (Do)
Take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys, that your game don't please

Baby, can't you see (See)
How these clothes are fitting on me (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat? (Beat)

Every boy's the same
Since up in the seventh grade
They've been tryna get with me
Tryna "Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha"
They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna "Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha"

I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down
'Cause they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah

Do you know that no
Don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushin' like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
Tryna get your— (Ah)

Do you know
That I know?
And I don't
Wanna go there
Yeah, they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah
