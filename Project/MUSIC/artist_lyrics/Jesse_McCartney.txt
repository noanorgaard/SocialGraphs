Girl there's something about me that you outta know
I've never felt the need to lose control, always held on back
And played it slow, but not this time

Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Baby take me on a journey, I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you, crazy let's do something Maybe, please don't take your time you got me
Right were you want me, whoa

Girl, I'm gonna let you have your way with me
When you move like that it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this, but I was wrong

Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Baby take me on a journey, I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you, crazy let's do something Maybe, please don't take your time you got me

Off my feet unexpectedly
In slow motion my imagination's running
Trying to keep my body still, ooh
I can hardly stand the thrill, yeah well

Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Baby take me on a journey, I've been thinking lately

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you

How do you, how do you sleep?

It still smells just like you
Damn, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep? (How do you sleep?)

Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you (Uh-huh)
See, things now I didn't before
Now wishing I had more time with you (Uh-huh)
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you? (Uh-huh)
All the things we thought about
Then never will have done happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

And again (Come and ask 'bout you)
They say, "We saw your girl at the game, and damn, we gotta say a big mistake by you"
Not only does your body bang, but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' no sleep
Can't think, can't eat, 'til I come see you

And my nights so cold (Cold), days so long (Long)
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Well, it's gone and I'm trippin' how much I miss it

And it's hard to understand (Hey), you got another plan (Hey)
Tryin' to play harder, you got another man
But you'll never find another like moi (Moi)
