Baby baby, baby baby
Baby baby, baby baby
Baby baby, baby baby
Ooh, I'm so glad

I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you, sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover
More precious than you, more precious than you
(
Girl you are
) Close to me you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother
You are the only one, my everything
And for you this song I sing

And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
And I hope that you do love me too

I said you're all that I'm thinkin' of (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
Said I promise to never fall in love, with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
And I really love you

And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you do love me too
And I hope that you feel the same way too

You're all that I ever known
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known when you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known when you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down

And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you do love me too
And I hope that you feel the same way too
And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you do love me too
And I hope that you feel the same way too
And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you do love me too
And I hope that you feel the same way too
