I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me

Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been lookin' for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies

I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight

I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold

And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart

You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight, night-night
Night, night, night

Ooh, ooh-ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight

Oh, put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Ooh, ah, ah
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave (You leave)
Hey, so I got a question (You leave)
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? (You leave)
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? (When you leave)
Your drug (You leave)
Huh, your drug (You leave)
Huh, your drug (When you leave)
Is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ah, ah, ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ah, ah, ooh-woah)
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug (Ah, ah, ooh-woah)
Your love, your love, your love (Ah, ah, ooh-woah)

Hey
Hey
So
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Is my drug
I like your beard
