What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my 
shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets 
colder
Most of us only care about 
money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the 
wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the 
media
Negative images is the main 
criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than 
bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
