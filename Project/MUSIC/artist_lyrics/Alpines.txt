Restless in the thought of you break down
The empty truth, I'm floating in the moment
I've been sleeping when it's so fragile
Deep down in a place there's a part of you, is a part of me
Undefinable, hard to believe
I've been praying for you endlessly

Love is timeless
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless
So love is timeless
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless

And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries

Graceless in the words I said I'm sorry
You know that you're everything to me
The way I feel, so plain
I'm exposing and devoting

Love is timeless (fragile)
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless
So love is timeless (fragile)
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless

And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries

We're motionless, we're motionless, we're motionless
We're motionless, we're motionless, we're motionless
