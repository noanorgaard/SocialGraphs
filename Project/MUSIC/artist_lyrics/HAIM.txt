No, please don't cry
I've never done this before, drove a million miles
Back when you were mine
I was too young to know you were the one to find

But if I was to say I regret it
Would it mean a thing?
'Cause every time I think, 
I think
, think about it
Memories take me back to all of our wildest times

If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

Now I won't go
I won't run away this time, you're all I want to know

But if I was to say I'll forget it
Would it mean a thing?
'Cause every time I think, I think, think about it
Memories take me back to all of our wildest times

If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love remind me

If I could change your mind
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

Visions of our love remind me
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
If I could change your mind
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
Visions of our love remind me
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
It took time to realize (Visions of our love)
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
Visions of our love remind me
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
Forgive my lying eyes
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
Visions of our love remind me
(To change your mind, to change your mind)
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine
Give me just a little of your love

You're just another recovering heart (hey)
I wasn't even gonna try
You wouldn't even give up time
Could, could be so easy, you make it hard (hey)
Don't think about love too much
My love is gonna be enough

You're so close now
And I know now

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love

Don't it feel like that night was from a dream (hey)
I've never felt nothing like that
Looking at you, looking right back
Don't, don't say nothing is ever as good as it seems (hey)
Stop running your mouth like that
'Cause you know I'm gonna give it right back

You're so close now
(Don't let me down)
So don't let me down

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love

Oh with a little strength baby
Oh, I'll never let you down
With a little love, a little love, a little love, a little love
Give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love

You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
You're so close now (give me just a little of your love)
