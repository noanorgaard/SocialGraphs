Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them, at least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip, I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, ha-ha-ha-ha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Mason's baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol gettin' money like Seacrest (Yeah)
