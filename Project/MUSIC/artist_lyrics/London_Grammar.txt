Sun, suffocate the atmosphere
But I'm safe with you, far away from here
Another fire through another open door
It's what I'm living for
Breath of mine, be all that you need
It's not much from a broken nothing
Wear another truth on your turned-up sleeve
This is everything I dream

Ooh, ooh
He-hell no
I am wild eyed and waiting
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, hell no
I am wild eyed and wandering

Fortunately I have enough of you
You say it's not where we are
It's not what we choose
Looking out from all that you have built
With red skies, I will drift

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, hell no
I am wild eyed and waiting
Ooh, ooh
He-hell no
I am wild eyed and wandering

Ooh
What are your dreams?
Ooh
What are your dreams?

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, hell yeah
I am wild eyed and waiting
Ooh, ooh
He-hell no
I am wild eyed and wandering

Ooh
What are your dreams?
Ooh
What are your dreams?
Ooh
What are your dreams?
