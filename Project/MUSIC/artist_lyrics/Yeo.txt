Wondrously show your steadfast love
Of those who seek refuge
Keep me as the apple of your eye
Hide me in the shadow of your wings

You have tried my heart
You have visited me by night
You have tested me
And you will find nothing

Wondrously show your steadfast love
Of those who seek refuge
Keep me as the apple of your eye
Hide me in the shadow of your wings
