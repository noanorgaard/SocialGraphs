You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down ('Nother)
You, you enchant me
Even when you're not around ('Nother)
If there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down ('Nother)
I'm latching on, babe
Now I know what I have found (
'Nother
)

'Nother

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (
'Nother
)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (
'Nother
)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (
'Nother
)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (
'Nother
)

I'm so encaptured
Got me wrapped up in your touch ('Nother)
Feel so enamoured
Hold me tight within your clutch (
'Nother
)
How do you do it?
You got me losing every breath ('Nother)
What did you give me
To make my heart beat out my chest? ('Nother)

In my space
'Nother

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (
'Nother
)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (
'Nother
)
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (
'Nother
)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (
'Nother
)

I'm latching on to you (I, I'm latching on to you)
I won't let go of you (No, I won't let go)
I'm latching on to you (I will not let go)
I won't let go of you (I won't let go, I won't let go)

I won't let go, I won't let go
