Forever can never be long enough for me
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now, we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will, mm-mm
Say you will, mm-mm

Together can never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words "I love you"
And "you're beautiful"

Now that the wait is over
Love has finally shown her my way

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will, mm-mm
Say you will, mm-mm

Promise me
You'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to sing to you
When all the music dies

Marry me
Today and every day
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this café
Say you will, mm-mm
Say you will, mm-mm

Marry me, mm-mm
