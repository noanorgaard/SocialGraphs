I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Yes, I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip, dot com
Now I got a word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah, I got a brand new spirit (Oh), speakin' and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won (Oh)
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan (Oh)
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack (Oh)
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feelin' it's a rap, ASAP
[Chorus: Etta James, 
Etta James & Flo Rida

Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
I get a good feeling, yeah

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second, I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never givin' in
Givin' up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of twenty men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den (Oh)
That flow, that spark, that crown
You lookin' at the king of the jungle now (Oh)
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound (Oh)
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee (Oh)
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates
Take a genius to understand me
[Chorus: Etta James, 
Etta James & Flo Rida

Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no, no
I get a good feeling, yeah


Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'
Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'

Gotta love the life that we livin'

Hey

Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin' gone wild, can't handle this playa
Life of the club arrogant like yeah
Talk like money so the girls just melt
One too many, all on me like twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'm in the building, hey!

Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi tryna make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off they clothes
Grand finale like Super Bowl
Go hard, I run the show
That's right, wild out, got money to blow
More lights, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah! I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?

Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

Look

And I'm bettin' you love freak mode
And I'm bettin' you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego
I bet you I'm guilty, your honor (Honor)
That's just how we live in my genre (Genre)
Who in the hell done paved the road wider? (Hey)
There's only one Flo and one Rida (Woo)

Pull a damn hamstring tryna put it on ya
Let your lips spin back around calmer
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close

Shawty don't even know, she can get in it for the low
Told me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
Baby, we start slow, then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
So amusing ('Musing)
Now you can make a whistle with the music (Music)
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it (Do it)
Even if it's no picture, never lose it (Lose it)

Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It's on and poppin tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
'Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours
Lil' mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl, you the truth with all of that goody power, 'cause

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down

Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands
My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl, won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me
Like, dammit, I know you
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur, 'cause
[Chrous: Flo Rida, 
Kesha

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down

Yeah, I'm spending my money (Hey)
I'm outta control (Hey)
Somebody help me
She's taking my bank roll
But I'm king of the club (Hey)
And I'm wearing the crown
Popping these bottles, touching these models
Watching they asses go down, down

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Nwod, down, down, down, nwod, nwod, nwod, nwod
