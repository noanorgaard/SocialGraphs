Woo
Mm, yeah

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Woo)
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (Mm, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah (Mm, yeah)


There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
Well, I wanna ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I wanna ride it all night long (Woo, yeah)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long, yeah; come on, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby)
If you're goin' my way (You're goin' my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (All night long)
It's summer nights baby!

Come on ladies, it's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on
Flip flop tan and some white sand
I know the perfect spot
Well the sunset better set soon so we can get in the mood
Things start gettin' all heated up when it starts gettin' cool
Yeah

Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Come on -- Oh, yeah, yeah

Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let them teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies - y'all keep doing y'alls thing
Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream
The sun is getting low, there it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah

Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights


Oh, it's a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona, y'all
Well, it's wild and it's free

Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Summer nights

Holler if you're ready for some summer nights

Yeah, yeah are you ready
For some summer nights
Yeah, baby
Summer nights
It's summer nights
Come on
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

That every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

Yes, he did

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you, ooh


And now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Ooh, mm
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, settin' the mood
Well, I just lie there starin'
Silently preparin' to love on you

Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowin' that forever, you're all mine

The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt


I melt (I melt), every time you look at me that way
It never fails (Fails)
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt (I melt)
(I just melt)

Every time you look at me that way (I just melt)
I melt (I just melt)
I melt
Ooh

I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish

I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More than anything)
Yeah, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there gettin' where you're gettin' to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah


My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to

Yeah, this is my wish (My wish for you)

Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right

Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it
Should have known running around was gonna cost him
