It's hard to see you happy
It's harder to see you cry
It's hard to see you happy
It's harder to see you cry
Certainly right to suffer
To think about you without me, babe
It's hard to see you leave
It's harder to say goodbye
It's hard to see you leave
It's harder to say goodbye
Certainly right to suffer
To think about you without me, babe
I hear you're doing great, babe
I hear you're doing fine
I hear you're moving forward, on time
Certainly right to suffer
To think about you without me, babe
