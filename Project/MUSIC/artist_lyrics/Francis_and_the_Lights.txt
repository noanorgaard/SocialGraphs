In the ground, we bury
The seeds of a pear tree
All the things, we carried
Now we're down to our bare feet

May I have this dance to make it up to you?
Can I say something crazy? I love you
Give me both your hands to make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

We are bound to inherit
The sins of our parents
And all of the people we passed through
Now we're down to the last two

May I have this dance to make it up to you?
Can I say something crazy? I love you
Give me both your hands to make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

You've got your, your mother's eyes
You've got your, grandmother's ring
You've got your daddy's discernment
Girl, you did your thing, oh, give me one more
One, two, one, two, always on beat
You must have been born with two right feet
I know you've been looking for something concrete
You must have been born with two right feet
Say one, two, one, two, always on beat
I know you've been looking for something concrete
You must have been born with two right feet
You must have been born with two right feet
Said I love you more than your mother
More than you love yourself

May I have this dance to make it up to you?
Can I say something crazy? I love you
Give me one more chance, give me one more chance
Give me one more, let me spin and excite you
May I have this dance to make it up to you?
Can I say something crazy? I love you
Give me one more chance, give me one more chance
Give me one more, let me spin and excite you
