Ain't shady, baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and flower
You're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh-oh-oh, no

I tackle, we tussle , and oh my days
We're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his Colt
Single-action army
Oh-oh-oh

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh-oh-oh, no

N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh my days, he disagrees
Oh-oh-oh, no
(Speak easy)


Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh, no

Ain't shady, baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and flower
You're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh, no
