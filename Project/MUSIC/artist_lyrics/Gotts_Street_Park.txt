Turning up, twelve o'clock
You've been alone
Photograph, knew that man
He was my all

I could tell by the look that you gave
You ain't been truthful, no
Taking care with the time that you made
For your lady and you

We were just wasting time
You were mourned before
Love in bad company
I won't be calling no more
We were just wasting time
You were mourned before
Love in bad company
I won't be calling no more

Roll your eyes, hand in mine
Seen it before
Bring me down, creep around
Each time she calls

I could tell by the look that you gave
You ain't been truthful, no
Is she worth what you're making me feel
When I was so good to you?

We were just wasting time
You were mourned before
Love in bad company
I won't be calling no more
We were just wasting time
You were mourned before
Love in bad company
I won't be calling no more
