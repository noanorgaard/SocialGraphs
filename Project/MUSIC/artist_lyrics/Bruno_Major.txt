Smash all the pictures where I am in the frame
Toy with my emotions as if it is a game
In the heat of the moment, call someone else's name
I would love you just the same

Drag me through the dirt
Cut me to the bone
Leave me for dead and laugh your way back home
I'd still be smiling like a madman in the rain
And I would love you just the same

So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction
Of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I still love you just the same

Flog me with malice 'til the rivers running red
Make me an outlaw
Put a price upon my head
Cast me to exile or a house for the insane
And I would love you just the same

So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction
Of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
'Cause I still love you just the same
