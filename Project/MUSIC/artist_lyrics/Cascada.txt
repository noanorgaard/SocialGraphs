(
Oh
) Turn up the music, let's get out on the floor
I like to move it, come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control (Uh-huh)
There's people watching me (Uh-huh), I never miss a beat

Steal the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose) Like an overdose

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

(Oh) My body's aching, system overload (Overload)
Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me, I'm intoxicated, diggin' the show (Uh-huh)
It's got me hypnotized (Uh-huh), everybody step aside

Steal the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose) Like an overdose

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, push it to the top
Come on and evacuate, feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate, you don't have to be afraid

Now guess who's back on a brand new track
That got everybody in the club goin' mad?
So everybody in the back
Get your back up off the wall and just shake that thang
Go crazy, yo, lady, yo, baby
Let me see you work that thang
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dance floor, yo

(Everybody in the club) Evacuate the dance floor
(Everybody in the club) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream
Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life


Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life
