Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
Better say my name

Any other day I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh-huh, yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name (Say my name, is around you)
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you" (Love you)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby" (Baby, yeah, yeah)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
 (Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game
 (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
Better say my name

What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you" (I love you)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby" (Say my name)
Why the sudden change? (Sudden change)
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
 (If ain't nothin' changed, oh)
If you ain't runnin' game
 (Baby, say my name)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
 (Ooh, oh)
Better say my name

Oh, yeah (Where my ladies at?)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, yeah (Please say that, come on)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (All the girls say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah (I can't hear ya)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (All the girls say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (All the girls say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah (Break it down)
Oh, woah, woah (Ye-ye-yeah)
(Uh, uh-uh, DC, take it to the bridge, come on)

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems

Thou shalt know she can't love you
Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last weekend, you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies
This weekend you're goin' out
If he tried to stop you, you're goin' off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
You and your crew parlayin' at the hottest spot, tonight, you're gonna
Find the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

All you ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah, it's true, you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Call your boys, 'cause tonight you're not gon' stay at home
You should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight, you're goin' solo
Cut her off as she talk some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your haircut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best 'cause you're turnin' heads tonight, you're gonna
Find a sexy chica that's gon' dance all night if you wanna
