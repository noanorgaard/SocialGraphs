Of course, it is

I (I) was so wrong (Wrong) for so long (Long)
Only tryna please myself (Myself)
Girl, I (I) was caught up (Up) in her lust (Lust)
When I don't really want no one else, so no
I know I shoulda treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in (Let me in)
Give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man (Oh)
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be livin' so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

And ooh (Ooh), what I'd do (Do) with one chance (Chance)

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together

So let me in (Let me in)
Give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man (Oh)

(Beluga Heights)
Ooh, oh
Oh, yeah, mm

A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
Singing, oh-woah
Ooh, oh-woah
Ooh-woah
Oh, yeah

How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?"

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl, I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when I

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (Yeah)
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (The day I get on my knees)
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (And what you do to me, baby)
Got me singing, ooh-woah
Got me singing, ooh-woah
Would you marry me, baby? Ooh-woah
Ooh-woah (Ay)
Ooh-woah (Yeah)

A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do
