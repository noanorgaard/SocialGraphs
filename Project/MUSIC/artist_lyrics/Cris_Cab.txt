Alright, alright, alright yeah
Freak freaking in the house
Don’t move, don’t move, don’t
Just shut your mouth!
I put my sneakers on and I take a walk outside
Cause everyday I’m growing older, yeah
If I never caught my friend and met that girl last night
I’ll still be sitting on my sofa
Chorus:
Every time the sun comes up on the beach in Miami
All the freaks come out to play!
(They come again, they come again)
Cause there’s a girl around the corner
That’s living on Sunday!
Every time my door slams shut
Well another opens up and it’s always gonna be this way
(Just come again, come again)
Cause when it’s all over I was living on Sunday!
Hey, hey, hey what you want, what you want
Keep the level, keep the level
Now every choice I made, doesn’t need an explanation
Cause only I know where I’m going!
(I keep it moving, keep it moving)
If I’m doing doughnuts in my track
Or having breakfast for my lunch is cause
I wanna do it all!
Chorus:
Every time the sun comes up on the beach in Miami
All the freaks come out to play!
(They come again, they come again)
Cause there’s a girl around the corner
That’s living on Sunday!
Every time my door slams shut
Well another opens up and it’s always gonna be this way
(Just come again, come again)
Cause when it’s all over I was living on Sunday!
Do it on, baby, you can do it on
If you wanna start over I can show you how
It’s been a long, long time since you’ve seen this town
I’m in Miami, I’m in NYC!
Do it on, baby, you can do it on
If you wanna start over I can show you how
It’s been a long, long time since you’ve seen this town
I’m in California, I’m out in DC!
Do it on, baby, you can do it on
If you wanna start over I can show you how
It’s been a long, long time since you’ve seen this town
I’m in the Bahamas, I’m sailing the Haiti-es!
Chorus:
Every time the sun comes up on the beach in Miami
All the freaks come out to play!
(They come again, they come again)
Cause there’s a girl around the corner
That’s living on Sunday!
Every time my door slams shut
Well another opens up and it’s always gonna be this way
(Just come again, come again)
Cause when it’s all over I was living on Sunday!
I was living yeah
Keep living, keep living oh oh
Such a nice day, what a lovely day
The 7th, the 7th day is the day it all start!
Taking it easy, taking it easy, taking my time!
Such a nice day!
