Oh-oh, oh-oh (So much for my happy ending)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (So much for my happy ending)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hangin'
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything
That I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (I know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (But so are they)
But they don't know me
Do they even know you? (Even know you)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (All the shit that you do)

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything
That I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you care
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

He was everything, everything
That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

You were everything, everything
That I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it (We lost it)
And all of our memories so close to me
Just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly, she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
