I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you gotta trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

You got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Catfight intimidation

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

To read a mind you've got to re-
Define the line to make your circles sing, y'all
He knows everything
You make a sound, the spell is bound
To come around, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Catfight intimidation
All out interfacin'
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Databasin' infiltration


I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you gotta trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't want to live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really wanna do is turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses too

You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all in then I'd find a way to share

Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means for me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are

Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose, make me wanna say
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

I see you in the park, you're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and anyone from any other crew
I am small but I'm strong, I'll get it on with you
If you want me to, what else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do
If you want them to, what else can they do?
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

I'll come around and make peace, get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
I am small but I'm strong, you see I'm just like you
If you only knew that I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew that they're just like you
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

If you want me to, what else can I do?
'Cause I'm just like you if you only knew

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams, yeah
Have turned to demons of greed, that's mean

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
I’ll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh yeah

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time


Yeah!


Oh so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
A holy rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
Well, I'll be coming back baby, I'll be coming back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
I could not forget but I will not endeavour
Simple pleasures are much better, but I won’t regret it, never

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time
Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill, you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight

Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find a way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick, it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat
Suicide is never gonna save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this
One, two
If I want to—

She's the one, she's the only one
She's got ripped back light, gonna make me come
I say, when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you (Ah-ah) see me and that is why
I hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel (Ah-ah) your fire jump up to meet

I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
(Oh, yeah!)

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set (Ah-ah) my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched (Ah-ah) out mouth and a pack of style

I say, she's the one, she's the only one
Make me search (Ah-ah) myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea (Ah-ah) of stars make a diagram?
And—

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

Oh, yeah!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
(Oh, yeah!)

So alive, I arrive on dust
You can search (Ah-ah) my mind for the red on rust
I said, take me there and she really cares
Lighten up (Ah-ah) for me, gonna hear my prayers
I said—

Now, I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better now
Three, four

Hustle, bustle and so much muscle, oh
Cells about to separate
And I find it hard to concentrate, and
Temporary this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate, and

All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this moment to make you my family, and
Finally, you have found something perfect, and
Finally, you have found—

Death-defying, this mess I'm buying
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate, and
Estuary is blessed, but scary
Your heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate, and

One to treasure the rest of your days here, and
Give you pleasure in so many ways, dear, and
Finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found—
(Here we go)


Do you want me to show up for duty?
And, serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And, finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found...

...yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world?
And, now, we are as one

My lone ranger, the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure eight
And I'll do my best to recreate, and
Sweet precision and soft collision, aw
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate, and

All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found—

All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found yourself
