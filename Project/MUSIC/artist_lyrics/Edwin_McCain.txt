Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see
The smile upon your face

And these are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
And these are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are
Is everything in me

And these are the moments I know Heaven must exist
And these are the moments I know all I need is this
I've found all I've waited for, yeah
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
And every prayer has been answered
And every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Oh, here with you, here with me, oh
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah

And these are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
And these are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've got all I've waited for, yeah
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
And every prayer has been answered
Every dream I've had's come true
Yeah, right here in this moment
Is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you, here with me

I could not ask for more than the love you give me
'Cause it's all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more, more
Ah-ha-ah, yeah, yeah
And I could not ask for more
Oh-oh-oh-oh
