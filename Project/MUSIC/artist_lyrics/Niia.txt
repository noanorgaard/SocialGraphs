(I ca-came, I ca-came...
I-I-I-I...
I ca-came, I ca-came...
I-I-I-I...)

Came to California
Nothing but those blue skies
Why'd I leave my old life?
Blame it on your grey eyes

Oh, but love's deceiving
You know I've tried
Came to California (California)
Ooh, but now I don't know why

'Cause every time you need me, I fall apart
And every time you trust me, I break your heart
Every time you kiss me, it's just okay
And every time you're with me, I'm far away
Yeah

Riding up the coastline
Swimming in the moonlight
Nothing lasts forever
Yeah, even on the west side

Ooh, 'cause love's deceiving
You know I've tried
Came to California (California)
Ooh, but now I don't know why

'Cause every time you need me, I fall apart
And every time you trust me, I break your heart
Every time you kiss me, it's just okay
And every time you're with me, I'm far away
'Cause every time you need me, I fall apart
And every time you trust me, I break your heart
And every time you kiss me, it's just okay
And every time you're with me, I'm far away

'Cause every time you need me, I fall apart
And every time you trust me, I break your heart
And every time you kiss me, it's just okay
And every time you're with me, I'm far away

(Ooh, California
Ooh, California)
