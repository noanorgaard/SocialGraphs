Where can I find the city of shinin' light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?

The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

Mmm, hmm-hmm

What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world?
I'd walk to the end of the Earth, and afar
In an ordinary world

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Mmm, hmm-hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Where can I find the city of shinin' light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?

Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world

Mmm, hmm-hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love, first forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a fading memory

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever

Scars, broken hearts
Breakin' in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls, bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our life beyond the stars

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby


I've got no supervision
Nothin' will change my spirit's place to roam
I'll plead my innocence, I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense when you are young

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train, and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now, you'll roam
