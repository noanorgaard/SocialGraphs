One, two, three, let's go!

Lil mama, show me how you move it

Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!

Go, go, go, 50 in the house, bounce
Y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums, nigga
I ain't stupid, I say Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves is so erotic
I watch her, I'm like, "Bounce that ass, girl"
I get it crump in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh (one, two, three, let’s go!)

Sip champagne and burn a little greenery

Disco inferno, let's go
You're now rocking with a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two-step wit a lil twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we finna carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon' be up in this bitch till we break daylight (daylight) (one, two, three, let’s go!)

You see me shining, lit up with diamonds
Cause I stay grindin', uh-huh
Homie, you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah
Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay, let's go

Lil mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it

Nah, that's a semi-auto and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin' the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You gettin' money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred Gs, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
Ds come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard

In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand, ha-ha

Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
On my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say, "Only God can judge me," 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my Black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in GoodFellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)

Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more

Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move

You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask twenty-one questions and they all about us
