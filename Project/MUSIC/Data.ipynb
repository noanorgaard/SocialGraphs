    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis is based on the **Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD)**, introduced as part of the RecSys Challenge 2018 by Spotify Research [1]. The dataset contains **1,000,000 user-generated playlists**, sampled from over 4 billion public playlists created on the Spotify platform between January 2010 and November 2017. Each playlist includes metadata such as playlist title, number of tracks, number of albums, and duration, as well as detailed track-level information including track name, artist name, album name, and track duration. In total, the MPD comprises **over 2 million unique tracks by nearly 300,000 artists**. Playlists were sampled with randomization and manually filtered to ensure quality and remove offensive content [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "In our report we have decided to use the first 1000 playlists as the foundation for our network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To enrich the network with semantic information, we scraped lyrics for the tracks associated with each artist from the Genius website[3] using a Genius API[4]. For each artist, we collected the full text of their songs, including verses, choruses, and bridges, and stored them in plain text files. These files were aggregated at the artist level, resulting in a single combined lyric corpus per artist.\n",
