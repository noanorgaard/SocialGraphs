 executive director's notes: in addition to the notes below, and so you will *not* think all the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have been corrected, here are the first few lines of hamlet, as they are presented herein: barnardo. who's there? fran. nay answer me: stand & vnfold your selfe bar. long liue the king * * * * * as i understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u, above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . . the answer is that they may have packed "liue" into a cliche at a time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in place of some "w"'s, etc. this was a common practice of the day, as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend more on a wider selection of characters than they had to. you will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as i have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a very high place in the "canon" of shakespeare. my father read an assortment of these made available to him by cambridge university in england for several months in a glass room constructed for the purpose. to the best of my knowledge he read all those available . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes, that shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous for signing his name with several different spellings. so, please take this into account when reading the comments below made by our volunteer who prepared this file: you may see errors that are "not" errors. . . . so. . .with this caveat. . .we have not changed the canon errors, here is the project gutenberg etext of shakespeare's the first part of henry the sixt. michael s. hart project gutenberg executive director * * * * * scanner's notes: what this is and isn't. this was taken from a copy of shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as i can come in ascii to the printed text. the elongated s's have been changed to small s's and the conjoined ae have been changed to ae. i have left the spelling, punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the printed text. i have corrected some spelling mistakes (i have put together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the geneva bible and shakespeare's first folio and have unified spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded abbreviations as i have come across them. everything within brackets [] is what i have added. so if you don't like that you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a purer shakespeare. another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual differences between various copies of the first folio. so there may be differences (other than what i have mentioned above) between this and other first folio editions. this is due to the printer's habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then continuing the printing run. the proof run wasn't thrown away but incorporated into the printed copies. this is just the way it is. the text i have used was a composite of more than 30 different first folio editions' best pages. david reed ===================================================================== the tragedie of romeo and juliet actus primus. scoena prima. enter sampson and gregory, with swords and bucklers, of the house of capulet. sampson. gregory: a my word wee'l not carry coales greg. no, for then we should be colliars samp. i mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw greg. i, while you liue, draw your necke out o'th collar samp. i strike quickly, being mou'd greg. but thou art not quickly mou'd to strike samp. a dog of the house of mountague, moues me greg. to moue, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand: therefore, if thou art mou'd, thou runst away samp. a dogge of that house shall moue me to stand. i will take the wall of any man or maid of mountagues greg. that shewes thee a weake slaue, for the weakest goes to the wall samp. true, and therefore women being the weaker vessels, are euer thrust to the wall: therefore i will push mountagues men from the wall, and thrust his maides to the wall greg. the quarrell is betweene our masters, and vs their men samp.
