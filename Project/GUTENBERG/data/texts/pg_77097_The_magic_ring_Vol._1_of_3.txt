<p>I know not, my dear friend, whether you recollect
a conversation that we had some time since
respecting the Baron de la Motte Fouqué and
his writings. If you do not, I take the liberty
of calling it to your remembrance,—as what you
then said has not only induced me to execute the
following translation, but may likewise serve as
an introductory notice to the readers of the work.</p>

<p>I remember well that, when speaking of the
Baron, (in whose company we had dined that
day at Charlottenburg,) you bestowed great
praise on his various publications;—but, being
then an incompetent judge of their merits, I
could only reply, that I doubted not they deserved
the eulogiums you passed upon them,
since the Baron was certainly a jovial and pleasant
companion,—a “chevalier, <i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>,” if one might judge from the serenity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi"></span>of his aspect, and the complacency with which
he quaffed his old Hochheimer and Johannisberg.</p>

<p>I had indeed, as a tyro in the German language,
tried to read over his “Magic Ring,” the
only work of his which had fallen in my way;
but I had not been long at Berlin ere I was
informed of the high reputation he had acquired
by his writings on various subjects. I heard of
his early devotion to literature; of his friendship
with the Schlegels; of his being “<i>in utrumque
paratus</i>,” with the pen and the sword; of his
campaigns as an officer, when the tumults and
devastations of the French invasion were at their
height; and especially of his conduct in the battles
of Kulm in Bohemia, of Lutzen, of Leipsig,
and afterwards on the banks of the “castellated
Rhine.” I had opportunities of meeting with
the Baron, and was invited to pass some days at
his country residence of Nennhausen; though
circumstances rendered it impossible for me to
profit sufficiently by his hospitality.</p>

<p>I also remember that, on the evening to which
I have alluded, you were so eloquent in praise
of the Baron, that we were detained till it was
too late to go to the opera,—and therefore
walked up and down in the long <i>allée</i>, under
the lime-trees, for nearly two hours, during
which time you went on analyzing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii"></span>commending every one of his numerous productions.
Among these, you expressed your special
admiration of his “Hero of the North,” and
“Eginhard and Emma;” both of which, you
insisted, were animated by the true spirit of
chivalry and romance, and that in an English
dress they would be excellent, either in
their dramatic form, or remodelled into prose
novels. But, as I expressed my dislike to dramatic
poems which were unfit for the stage, you
proceeded to mention the Baron’s other narrative
works, such as “Waldemar the Pilgrim,” “Thiodulf’s
Wanderings,” “Bertrand de Guesclin,”
and many more, which, though favourites of
yours, are altogether unknown in this country.</p>

<p>At last we came to speak of the “Magic
Ring,”—the only one of our author’s works
which I had then seen, and which I had
only glanced at very hastily;—and you naturally
asked me how it happened, that although
“Undina,” “Sintram,” and even the
“Minstrel Love,” were translated into English,
this romance had been hitherto neglected? To
this I replied, that the “Sintram” and “Undina”
were, even in the translation, interesting tales of
wonder;—but that, on the contrary, the beauties
of the “Magic Ring,” which are so much admired
by a German reader, depended on certain
characteristic features, which a translator could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii"></span>never impart, unless by means of a <i>remaniement</i>
or <i>rifacimento</i>. These peculiarities were, first,
the Baron’s accurate imitation of the quaint, rude
style of the old romancers; secondly, the melody
of his verses, in which the thoughts are far too
shadowy to be embodied in our language;
thirdly, his allegorical representations and historical
allusions, which no English reader could
well comprehend, especially as the author has
not furnished a proper key to unfold their
meaning.</p>

<p>These objections, especially the last, you
treated with indifference; and although my own
opinion (that a <i>remaniement</i> would have been
far better than a translation) remains unaltered,—yet,
having resolved to translate the “Magic
Ring” by way of experiment, I have adopted, as
nearly as possible, the method you suggested for
its execution.</p>

<p>For I recollect distinctly, that, on my requesting
to hear your opinion how an English version
ought to be attempted, your answer was, that
the “Magic Ring” would, if <i>literally</i> translated,
make a very amusing novel in the style adopted
among us sixty years ago in “Popular Tales of
the Germans,” and which, by the way, has been
recently exemplified in Mr Roscoe’s Italian Romances.
With regard to the <i>old-Frankish tournure</i>
of language, the stiffness with which a translator
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix"></span>too often moves through his task, and which has
been aptly compared to the performance of our
Macheath “dancing a hornpipe in real fetters,”
might perhaps serve as a tolerable imitation of
that characteristic. As to the songs and other
poetry, these, you said, were merely portions of
the story thrown into rhyme, and would succeed
just as well in prose as in verse.</p>

<p>Lastly, You observed, that, for understanding
the author’s allegorical allusions, nothing
more was requisite than to bear in mind the
history of the Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, &amp;c.;
otherwise known by the name of the Normans
(Nordmänner) or “Men of the North.”
These people (represented in this work by an
ancient warrior, bearing in his latter days the
name of Sir Hugh von Trautwangen,) being
poor, and dissatisfied with their own cold regions,
emigrated in great numbers to the more southern
countries of France, England, the Netherlands,
Germany, Italy; nay, it is said, even into Greece,
Palestine, and other oriental climes. Of these
historical facts, no school-boy in Britain is ignorant,
as every one has read of Normandy and
the Norman invasion.</p>

<p>The Nordmänner, or Normans, at the first
period of their emigrations, were Pagans,—the
votaries of Odin and the other fabulous gods
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x"></span>of Valhalla; they were also skilled in necromancy
and all the varied arts of the magician,—whether
for purposes of good or evil,—wherein
(as learned divines have sometimes maintained
of the ancient oracles) the devil might be supposed
to have assisted them.</p>

<p>Such are the materials whence Fouqué has
drawn the machinery of his romances. The
<i>white</i> magic of the now converted Druda contends
against the black machinations of the infidel
Gerda; and as for the “Mysterious Ring,” it
seems to have been only one among other necromantic
spells, though some readers have supposed
that the author hereby intended to allegorize
the delusive spirit of the World, and of the
worldly-minded, in opposition to that of pure
religion and heavenly affections. Hence the
Baron has represented the people of the North
as led astray to wage war against all nations
and against each other; till at last, by the influence
of Bertha, (a personification of the true
Christian faith,) they become harmonized and
happily united into one community.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” you added, “can be clearer and
more intelligible than this outline; and, if the
work were even <i>literally</i> rendered into English,
it would present an excellent ‘knightly tale of
the olden time,’ with a religio-historical moral.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi"></span>Let this be done, and there need be no doubt
entertained of its success.”</p>

<p>To these remarks I ventured to reply, that, to
the best of my judgment, there was not one character
in the romance, nor any part of the machinery,
under which the author had not involved
some abstruse and figurative meaning which
ought to be explained. Gerda, for example, I
alleged, was not a mere enchantress, introduced
for the purpose of bringing about some strange
adventures: on the contrary, she seemed to represent
Superstition, whose horrid rites are contrasted
with the mild and rational piety of the
Druda. The Ring, too, I thought, might not
only be intended to allegorize the delusions of
the world, but also those of natural-magic, (<i>die
natur-kenntnisse</i>,) and other profane sciences.—“Trouble
yourself no farther with such inquiries
and speculations,” you replied: “emblems and
allegories are nuts hard enough to crack; let the
readers break their teeth on them if they will.”</p>

<p>With this homely metaphor our discourse
ended; and your plan has accordingly been carried
into effect. Instead of indulging my own
feelings in a <i>remaniement</i>,—which would have
been a new work founded on old materials,—I
have merely translated the Baron’s words, (which
need not preclude other German scholars from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii"></span>bringing forward the same story on a different
plan); and, under the auspices of your name,
which is at least as well known here as that of the
Baron, it is not without some degree of confidence
that I introduce these volumes to the
public.</p>

<p>I am, my dear sir, with great respect, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is with a mixed feeling of apprehension and
delight, that the author now betakes himself to
his task of writing the following story. There
are people in the world who laugh scornfully, if
they meet with one of their fellow-mortals who
calls on Heaven to aid him in any worldly enterprise;
but, notwithstanding this, the writer of
these lines is not afraid to confess, that he has
just now prayed with his whole heart to the
Giver of all good, for assistance in the pleasant
labour which awaits him. By this means, he
has been supported ere now through similar undertakings;
and he confidently trusts, that at
this time also his prayers will not be unanswered.
For, in truth, the history, which he now
proposes to write, hovers yet, like a strange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv"></span>vision, before his “mind’s eye;” it seems to
him as if he were about to set sail on a wide weltering
sea, with shores varied and romantic, with
gleaming rainbow-tints on its waters, and not
without whirlpools and rocks; while the sky is
overspread with clouds of the wildest shapes and
the richest colouring!</p>

<p>Full well do I know the arduous course which
I have to steer; but as to the separate events
that are to be encountered, I know them not;
for these are yet uncertain as a dream. However
this may be, not the less boldly, courteous
reader, do I invite thee to join me in this voyage;
for, should’st thou be unwilling to engage
in the enterprise, it would seem as if the name
of God, on whom I have now called, sounded
strange and unwelcome in thine ears; otherwise
thou would’st be satisfied with what I shall obtain
by my prayers, and which I promise faithfully
to communicate to thee. But consider, I beseech
thee, that if thou shalt find any thing worthy of
commendation, and pleasing in my work, it is
not mine, but a gift from the Supreme Power,
which is conveyed to me insensibly as I write;
for I am then only capable of expressing myself
with effect, when my mind is more elevated than
is usual in the present state of our depraved and
mortal nature.</p>

<p>In the following pages, then, I lay before thee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv"></span>the best fruits of those hours when my fancy is
most free and exalted; while, in this preface, I
have spoken the plain, unadorned truth. On this,
as a true knight, I pledge my word of honour.
And now I bid thee heartily welcome to the
groves and meadows, the battles and festivals,
the joyous weddings, or mournful obsequies,
which our story may unfold.</p>

<p class="center">
How the young Squire Otto and his pretty Cousin discoursed<br>
together, on the banks of the Danube, during a<br>
fine evening in May.
</p>


<p>In the happy land of Suabia, close to the
river Danube, there lies a fine level meadow,
where once on a time (it was in the month of
May, just as the declining sunbeams were
taking leave of the flowers) a young squire,
by name Otto von Trautwangen, was enjoying
his evening recreation. At this beautiful
season, it was Otto’s custom frequently to
leave his father’s castle in the neighbouring
mountains, and repair to the pleasant banks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2"></span>of the river. Here he amused himself alternately
with angling in the streams, or in
shooting with a cross-bow at marks, which he
had contrived in many strange shapes, such
as dragons, hobgoblins, witches, &amp;c. and
painted in glaring colours. On the wide level
meadow he ran no risk of wounding any one
with his arrows. This evening, however, his
bow and quiver lay beside him on the grass,
and he held his fishing-rod, watching as it
seemed the play of his line in the water; but
he was lost in reverie, and forgot that he had
not even baited his hook.</p>

<p>Then Bertha von Lichtenried came walking
towards him, his father’s niece, along with
whom he had from his childhood been educated
at the castle. She took her place beside
him on the grass, and half mocking, half anxiously
questioned him on what he was meditating
so deeply? He himself knew not well
what to say, and now so much the less, when
he saw his cousin’s pretty face smiling on him
reflected in the water. She looked even <i>too</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3"></span>beautiful in his estimation, and perhaps she
thought the same of him, as she smiled on
her companion so kindly. It was delightful
to see how the two young people thus carried
on a silent conversation together in the living
mirror of the Danube! When Otto had considered
for a while, it occurred to him that he
had remarked a pilgrim, in a red-cross mantle,
passing on the opposite side of the river, after
which he had fallen into a mood of deep thought.
He told Bertha of this, and described to her
how solemn was the impression left on his
mind; how the pilgrim had always looked
steadfastly on the road before him, without
turning in the least to the right or left, so
that one could not precisely say whether it
was old age, humility, or an ardent longing
after the sacred object of his journey, that
bent his head forwards, and harmonized every
gesture. To this the young man added his
own reflections, how admirable it must be to
travel across kingdoms, seas, and rivers, to distant
unknown lands! Nothing in his opinion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4"></span>could be pleasanter than such a pilgrimage,
and it would never be the fatigue of travelling,
but only the tedium of repose afterwards, that
would prove oppressive.</p>

<p>“You do not mean to turn a pilgrim then?”
said Bertha with a confident smile. “The
Saints forbid!” said the young man; “these
woods and meadows here hold me like a magic
spell within their circle. Take care then that
you never desert them, my pretty cousin!” At
these words, Bertha blushed so deeply and
suddenly, that it seemed as if twin rosebuds
had sprung up in the water, and said, “As
you are so certainly to remain here, then we
may jest a little on the supposed possibility of
your going. Let us try for once that farewell
ditty, in two parts, which Master Walter has
so finely indited. As in winter, one likes to hear
the snow-storm, when sitting warm by the
fireside, so we may now venture to sing these
verses, which, in their proper place, we should
have no heart to repeat.” Otto then began,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5"></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Sweet home, so long beloved,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That I no more shall view,” &amp;c.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>But after the first two stanzas they gave
over their music, for on the other side of the
river there came a great procession of pilgrims,
among whom appeared such variety of characters,
that the young people found their attention
irresistibly attracted. In the midst of
the assemblage were graceful figures of young
women, mounted on mules, richly caparisoned,
and attended for their protection by warriors
on foot, with long halberts in their hands.
Then there were certain pilgrims, of whom,
notwithstanding their grey mantles and oddly-shaped
caps, it was easy to determine that
they must be courtiers, and persons of high
dignity, especially as their demeanour contrasted
so powerfully with that of a great
number of country people, who moved about
irregularly enough in the procession. One
could distinguish too, many respectable citizens
of middle rank, painters also, and musicians,
who bore with them the instruments of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6"></span>respective arts, which they hoped to exercise
in distant lands for the honour and glory of
our holy religion. At last there came a troop
of warlike knights, mounted on fine chargers,
in bright-gleaming armour, who could be
known as pilgrims only by the red cross on
their shoulders. Just as the procession came
opposite to Bertha and Otto, the ladies, mounted
on their stately mules, and attended by
their halberdiers, began to sing a grand choral
hymn in praise of the eastern lands, whither
they were thus pursuing their way.</p>

<p>The effect of their voices during the stillness
of the evening was magical. Accidentally
the sun, just then verging on the hills, broke
through a cloud with new and unexpected refulgence,
as if, instead of setting, he had been
about to rise again, in order to reward and
inspire those pious votaries. When the last
notes had died solemnly and slowly away, the
mail-coated knights struck in with a bold and
martial chorus, in which they were joined by
the halberdiers, while a powerful flourish of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7"></span>trumpets filled up the pause betwixt every
stanza. Their song expressed contempt of
the Saracens, and admiration of the English
King Richard the Lion Heart, whose forces
had just then gone forth like a thunder-storm,
destructive and yet beneficial, into the Holy
Land:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Who falls there, he is glorious,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And he who lives, victorious.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Such were the concluding words of their
chaunt; and when the long train had passed
by, both the young people remained for some
time thoughtful and silent. At length, “It
is very true,” said Otto, “King Richard of
England, who, for his bravery and magnanimity,
is called <i>Cœur de Lion</i>, has vowed to
make a crusade against the Saracens. My
father and Master Walter spoke of this all
last night at the castle. Good Heaven, what
grand exploits will be performed there!” On
saying this, the youth’s cheeks glowed and
his eyes sparkled. Bertha sighed as she answered,
“If you talk with such pleasure of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8"></span>wars and foreign travels, whenever any one
in the guise of a pilgrim happens to come
hither, then I shall no longer have courage to
sing that farewell-ballad which we had begun.”
“Nay, nay, be not afraid,” said Otto smiling,
“we shall not speak more of any such adventures.
Only attend now to your voice, and
keep up the octave. You know we are to
sing the next stanza together.”</p>

<p>It seemed destined, however, that they were
not to finish their ballad to-day; for just as
they had commenced again, they were disturbed
by a noise as of many horses from the
meadow behind them, and on turning their
eyes thitherward, they perceived—what we
shall describe in the next chapter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9"></span></p>



<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">
<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="c_02">CHAPTER II.</h2></div>

<p class="center">
How two Strangers (a Lady and a Knight) suddenly arrived,<br>
and how the Lady told a marvellous Story of a Ring.
</p>


<p>There were indeed many horses, from which
had alighted a number of well-dressed squires,
(or serving-men at arms,) who were already
busily employed in pitching on the meadow
handsome ornamental tents, coloured red, blue,
green, and yellow. Then there came a most
beautiful lady, with a train of female attendants,
all on horseback, and a knight in full
armour was waiting to receive her, by whom
she was lifted from her white palfrey with great
respect and attention. Thereafter it was a
pleasure to see how the lady and knight walked
backwards and forwards for pastime on the
green level plain; the former dressed in sky-blue
velvet, with a border of rich gold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10"></span>embroidery; the latter in a black coat of mail, yet
finely burnished and inlaid with many emblematic
devices in bright silver. His appearance
altogether was not a little strange and mysterious,
the fashion of his accoutrements being
such as Bertha and Otto had till now never
beheld. His demeanour, though courteous,
was grave and solemn; yet, as he wore no
helmet, they perceived that he was a young
man of very agreeable and sprightly features.</p>

<p>The two strangers, in the course of their
walk, came very near the spot where Otto and
Bertha were stationed, who of course greeted
them with a respectful salutation. The lady
returned this compliment, and her looks seemed
irresistibly attracted by the tall graceful
figures of the young people. She made a
signal that they should approach nearer,
and began a conversation, from which she
learned at once the whole history of their
peaceful, regular, and happy life. Their
narrative, indeed, was so short and simple,
and had so few adventures, that more words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11"></span>would have been superfluous. With a melancholy
smile then the lady turned to her
companion; “Count Archimbald,” said she,
“if we were called on to narrate our history,
could the task have been so easily accomplished?
And yet,” said she, turning to the
young couple, “it seems to me as if I had incurred
a debt which I must compensate, by
telling you the strange events of my pilgrimage.
You will no doubt find some entertainment
therein; and methinks it is only your
modesty and polite behaviour that prevent
you from asking who we are, and what has
brought us hither? But since you have spoken
so kindly and confidently to me, I should be
very ungrateful if I wrapt myself any longer
under the veil of mystery. Come then with us.”</p>

<p>With these words, Otto and Bertha were
led by the stranger into one of the tents,
which were by this time already spread. The
lady seated herself on a sofa, and made them
take their places beside her. Count Archimbald
went out to make divers arrangements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12"></span>as to his little camp, and, in a few minutes,
the lady began the following narration:—</p>

<p>“My name is Gabrielle, and I am descended
from the ancient race of Portamour.—Being
from my earliest infancy an orphan, I
yet frequently heard from the people to whom
I was given in charge, that I ought to be
one of the noblest and richest ladies in all
France, were it not for the absence of a
certain ring, which a countess of the Norman
family Montfaucon had contrived to get
into her possession; and which had been
inherited by her daughter, who was about
the same age with myself. So the ring
was constantly held out to me as the most
desirable and important of all worldly possessions;—whether
waking or asleep, I thought
and dreamed but of this alone, knowing
that this wonderful gem would not only
convey to me some extensive territories,
but, what was far more important in my estimation,
would bring along with it the knowledge
of several magical spells, and even a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13"></span>commanding influence over the world of spirits.
Judge what were my feelings, when one evening
at the King’s court, where I had just then
made my first appearance, a young lady was
introduced, by name Blanchefleur de Montfaucon,
on whose beautiful hand (for she was
indeed very beautiful) I directly recognized
the ring, which, from the frequent descriptions
that I had heard of it, was perfectly
known to me! To get this treasure into my
own possession was, for the first time, an easy
task; for, during the festival, we were to pass
the night in the same chamber, and Blanchefleur
having carelessly taken it from her
finger, I seized on my own family-property
as soon as she fell asleep. Next morning she
scarcely seemed to regret her loss; but, after
searching for a few moments in vain, she went
away gayly to attend the tournament, which
had just then begun. Thither I followed her,
and soon after we had taken our places, a
graceful and warlike knight rode up towards
her, who, as I understand, was her brother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14"></span>Sir Folko de Montfaucon. His bright falconlike
eyes had, in a moment, observed the absence
of the ring on her finger, and its appearance
on mine. After having interchanged a
few words with his sister, he came to me with
looks respectful indeed, but grave and determined;
then, pointing his lance to the ground,
‘Lady,’ said he, ‘may it please you to
select a champion, with whom I may try my
fortune in the lists, and from whom I may
win back that ring which now shines on your
beautiful hand, but which belongs to my sister,
Blanchefleur?’ Of course I did according
as he desired; but, in consequence of this
agreement, one of the most renowned and
skilful knights in France, whom I had chosen
for my defender, was thrown prostrate on the
sand, so quickly and decisively, that, according
to the rules of the combat, I had no alternative
left, but must immediately restore to
him the family-jewel, which I had possessed
for so short a while,—to be given back to his
admired sister, Blanchefleur.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15"></span></p>
<p>“I wept bitterly, and retired to my chamber,
where I would not listen to the messages
of my friends and youthful companions, who
wished me to join with them in the amusements
appointed for that afternoon and evening.
I spoke harshly too with my attendant,
when she brought into the room a finely-made
fishing-rod, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, with
a golden line and silver hook, which I was to
have used on the following day at a gay party
on the water. But of what consequence were
to me such diversions now that I had lost
my ring! The girl, discontentedly, set the
fishing-rod in the window-corner, and, as I
would not notice her, left me alone to weep.
Towards evening I became more tranquil,
and the loud laughing of my young companions,
who were playing at ball in the garden,
induced me at last to look through the window.
Then I observed that Blanchefleur, feeling
that her ring was inconvenient, took it from
her finger, laid it on a moss-covered seat under
my window, and thoughtlessly ran back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16"></span>to her game. With a beating heart and anxious
wishes, I drew open the lattice, upon
which motion the fishing-rod, as if offering its
services, fell into my arms. I immediately
made a trial,—found that the golden line
reached down to the ring, which, on the first
touch, as if I had been assisted by magic, attached
itself to the hook, and was drawn up
and received by me with a thousand kisses.</p>

<p>“My triumph, however, was again but
short-lived. No sooner had the childish Blanchefleur
complained to her brother, and the
ring been observed on my finger, (for I was
too proud to conceal what I supposed to be my
own property,) than he again requested that
I would appoint a champion to defend my
cause. And how could any one resist the
giant strength of Sir Folko? My new warrior
was overthrown like his predecessor; and this
time Blanchefleur gave the ring into her
brother’s care, so that I had less hope than
ever of regaining it. However, I did not fail
to keep constantly in view an object which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17"></span>was so dear to me; and one day, when, after
a hunting-party, we were resting beneath a
tree almost without branches, some one said,
that it would be quite impossible to climb to
the top of it. Then, in a tone of mockery,
I challenged Sir Folko de Montfaucon to
make a trial of his hitherto invincible powers
in this adventure. Just as I had hoped, his
ambition and excessive delight in all knightly
exercises made him quite lose sight of every
other consideration. Consequently he laid
the ring, which he generally wore always on
his finger, on the grass, because it hindered
him in climbing, then began his endeavours.
I understood afterwards, that, after many vain
attempts, he succeeded in reaching the top of
the tree; but meanwhile, I had, unobserved,
availed myself of the opportunity to seize on
my treasure, and was on my way to England,
in order that, in the court of King Richard
Cœur de Lion, I might find out a knight able
to maintain my rights against the frightfully
victorious Folko de Montfaucon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18"></span></p>
<p>“The great King Richard received me
with all the courtesy which was to be expected
from that mirror of knighthood; and when I
besought him to grant me a protector, he
made his most chosen favourite, and brother
in the battle-field, be introduced, commanding
him to kneel down, and beg for the
honour of devoting his life to my service.
How proud then was I, and with what indifferent
and cold looks did I soon afterwards
see Folko de Montfaucon enter the English
court in order to renew the combat for the
ring! Alas! my hopes were then vain. I
should have known that the English champions,
however brave and steadfast, are yet
inferior to the French in the sports of the
tournament. Indeed, my valiant defender,
conscious of this, had insisted, as a condition
of the fight, that it was not to be decided by
the lance only, but that the vanquished party
might maintain his rights afterwards with the
sword. In consequence of that precaution,
Folko’s victory was more laborious and more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19"></span>honourable, but by no means less certain or
less decisive. My champion was carried insensible,
with three sword wounds, out of the
lists, and Folko at the same moment kneeled
before me, requesting that I would give him
back the ring. The generous King Richard
addressed him, saying, that he should be satisfied
with having thus maintained and supported
his pretensions in the combat, but as
for the ring, he should leave it in the hands
of the fair lady to whom the possession of it
was evidently so very dear. ‘Most noble
king and pattern of all Christian knights,’ said
Folko, ‘if it depended on myself alone, this
beautiful lady should most certainly remain
in undisturbed possession of the ring; nay,
my life should be sacrificed if it would offer
any compensation for the tears with which her
bright eyes are now clouded; but the jewel
is the property of my sister, Blanchefleur de
Montfaucon, as whose champion I have now
the honour of appearing here; and, as your
majesty best knows, a knight dare not give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20"></span>away the rights of her for whom he has
fought in the lists.’</p>

<p>“To this King Richard could not make
any reply; and I was obliged to leave the
court once more deprived of my ring, and in
deep melancholy. Yet I lingered for some
time in that country, hoping that, as Sir Folko
had been always so fortunate in arms, I might
yet get the better of him by stratagem and
artifice. Accordingly I learned that he intended
making a journey into Wales, in order
to behold with his own eyes the fortresses and
ruined castles where, in old times, King
Arthur, and his knights of the round table,
had fought and banquetted. Determined to
brave all dangers, I ventured before him
among the Welsh mountains, and, disguising
myself in an old rusty coat of mail and helmet,
with the visor down, I waited for him in
a retired valley, through which I knew that he
must of necessity pass. He came up in due
time, and in a deep rough voice, which my
closed visor helped me to disguise, I challenged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21"></span>him to an immediate and mortal combat.
He demanded to know my name, and the
cause of my challenge, but I declined giving
that information, and affected to think that
he only sought a pretext to evade our engagement.
Furiously incensed, he then leaped
from his horse, (as I was on foot), with his
armour and weapons rattling and glancing, so
that I had almost fainted from terror. I recovered
myself, however, and said to him,
that I would not fight with him till he had
taken his enchanted ring from his finger, as it
was well known that this alone made him invincible,
and that without such aid he was
weak and cowardly as a child. With an exclamation
of anger and contempt, he then
pulled off his iron glove, threw the ring down
on the grass, which I directly seized upon, at
the same moment throwing off my visor’d
helmet, and saying,—‘Now, perhaps, Sir
Folko de Montfaucon will recognize Gabrielle
de Portamour, and he will doubtless have too
much generosity to take the ring from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22"></span>young damsel who has here no protector, or
even to delay her intended journey.’ He
bowed, and was silent. After a pause, however,
he said, ‘I shall have the honour,
lady, to meet you again in inhabited places,
where you will doubtless find a choice of defenders.’
Thereupon I directly made my
escape, and having my attendants in waiting
with my horses, I rode away as fast as possible
to the sea-shore, where I was lucky enough
to find a ship that brought me over in safety,
and with favourable winds, to Germany,
which country I now preferred to France,
because I had heard that it was the very
temple and chief resort of brave and generous
knights.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, since I came thither, the
noble Count Archimbald of Waldeck has
sworn that he will be my champion and
defender of my rights; so that I have
scarcely any farther anxiety, as he is so renowned
a warrior, and has yet never been
subdued in any rencontre. Consequently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23"></span>also, I wear the blue and gold colours
of the Montfaucon family, in order to indicate
the claims which the ring gives me
over their property. Houses and lands, however,
I shall willingly leave in their power,
provided I can still retain my beloved and
wonderful ring. Perhaps the frightful Folko
has by this time given up thoughts of it; for
since our parting in Wales I have not seen
him; so that I may applaud my own artifice
and resolution, thus affording me an opportunity
of becoming gradually acquainted
with the wonderful properties of the jewel,
which hitherto I had known only by dark
and mysterious rumours.”</p>

<p>Otto and Bertha expressed in courteous
and well-chosen words their gratitude to
the noble lady for her interesting story.
Bertha then said, in a low timid voice,—“This
ring must surely be very beautiful.”—“I
shall shew it to you most willingly,” said
the smiling Gabrielle, thereupon drawing it,
suspended on a gold chain, from her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24"></span>snow-white bosom. It was fashioned as follows:
Two serpents of the purest gold were intertwined
with each other, on whose heads were
crowns of rubies; on the circle were engraved
characters such as Otto could not read; but
he remembered having seen such before on
very old weapons in his father’s armoury.
He knew also, that they were called Runic
letters, and had their origin in distant countries
of the north. Over and between the
serpents’ crowns was a bright green stone,
which in colour might be compared to the
waters of the Danube, but Gabrielle said that
its hues were exactly like those of the sea.</p>

<p>While the young people were thus admiring
the jewel, and wondering at the strange
characters, (the tent being now brightly illuminated,)
the curtain at the entrance was
drawn aside, and Sir Archimbald entered,
followed by another knight.</p>

<p class="center">
How this Knight was challenged by Sir Folko de Montfaucon,<br>
and of a fearful combat fought by torch-light in the<br>
lists.
</p>


<p>On the stranger’s approach, Otto and Bertha
exclaimed at the same moment,—“Good
Heaven, there is the frightful knight, Sir
Folko de Montfaucon!” During Gabrielle’s
narrative, they had formed to themselves a
lively picture of this victorious hero, to which
the looks of the stranger guest now wonderfully
corresponded. They had not been deceived;
for Gabrielle suddenly became deadly
pale, and the knight came up with great respect
and formality, inquiring whether she
had chosen the warrior, by whom he had just
before been invited into the tent, for her champion,
and if it would now be allowed him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26"></span>try his fortune in combat in order to win
back the ring? To this address Gabrielle
made a sign in the affirmative, and Sir Archimbald
interposed. “Sir Knight, although
you are yet a stranger to me, yet it is my
duty to inform you, that I am the Graf von
Waldeck. My character is, perhaps, already
known to you; and you have now free choice
whether you will venture with me in the lists,
or give up the ring in friendship and peace.”
At these words a deep flush came over the
cheeks of Sir Folko de Montfaucon, and his
dark eyes gleamed like a distant thundercloud.
However, he made a courteous bow,
and said, in a mild voice,—“I know not, my
Lord Count, if you will not think it beneath
your dignity to conquer such a humble opponent
as the Chevalier Folko de Montfaucon;
but this much I can truly say, that the honour
of contending with so renowned a knight
as Count Archimbald von Waldeck would
alone induce me to request the combat, even
if there were not any other motive for our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27"></span>encounter.” “Shall we then enter the lists
to-night?” said Sir Archimbald. “That must
be decided by this noble damsel,” said Sir
Folko; “perhaps from the fatigue of her
journey it might not be convenient to her to
look on our conflict this evening.” “Rather
let it be to-day than to-morrow,” said Gabrielle,
in an accent of haste and anxiety. Accordingly
the Count went out to prepare the
ground, having previously agreed with his
opponent, that whoever should first be driven
out of the ring, (by whatever cause this might
happen,) should be looked upon as vanquished,
and should be allowed no farther chance
on this occasion; otherwise, however, they
were to be allowed the right of contending
with swords, after their fortune had been duly
tried with the lance, according to the example
given in the court of King Richard the Lion
Heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Archimbald being employed
without in making preparations for this tragical
pastime, Folko had taken Gabrielle’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28"></span>lute, seated himself with it at her feet, and
begun gracefully to play with the strings. It
was a pleasure to look on him in his dark-blue
armour, finely inlaid and gleaming with gold,
his dark-brown hair, upturned whiskers, smiling
lips, and pearly teeth. As to Gabrielle, she
fixed her eyes steadfastly on the ground, in
silent impatience, and suffering all the agonies
of suspense. Whoever had chanced to see these
two, the knight and the lady, both clad in the
same colours, and thus sitting together, would
never have thought that there were any evil
intentions betwixt them; but rather that the
lady had made him a present of the fine blue
and gold scarf which flowed over his broad
shoulders, and that he was now thanking her
for her courtesy by a love-melody on her lute.
Such peace and tranquillity, however, were
not of long continuance. Archimbald soon
made his appearance, in a frightful guise, at
the entrance of the tent; for he had now put
on his helmet, with the visor closed, which
represented the head of an eagle, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"></span>great silver beak; to which strange headdress
the rest of his armour so well corresponded,
that he might have been looked on
as a visitant front some fabulous land of
hobgoblins and monsters. “All is ready,”
said he; whereupon Folko started up, light as
a feather, from his position at Gabrielle’s feet,
laid away the lute with great care, where he
had found it on the carpet, and with an elegant
bow quitted the tent. Then Sir Archimbald
offered the lady his arm, and led her
out. Otto and Bertha followed, lost in astonishment,
and scarce daring to believe in this
realization of scenes such as had been known
to them before only in their ballads and
romances.</p>

<p>When they came out of the tent, a bright-beaming
light guided them to the ground
that had been prepared by Sir Archimbald.
A circle, wide enough for the attack and
career of two horses, was enclosed by a double
row of torches, whose red flames burned
powerfully amid the calm darkness of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30"></span>night, casting all distant objects into the
blackest shade, while even the minutest flower
or plant was visible in the circle. Archimbald
led Gabrielle to a turf-seat, covered with
a rich carpet, so placed, that she was directly
opposite the middle of the enclosed ground,
on which spot the two knights would meet in
their fearful encounter. Near the lady were
stationed Otto and Bertha, one on each side;
and behind her were a numerous train of her
own and Archimbald’s attendants. On the
opposite side of the ring were visible, through
the red torch-light, many strange figures in
rich dresses, who were probably squires of
Sir Folko de Montfaucon.</p>

<p>Count Archimbald now formally requested
leave of absence from the lady, and went away,
on her right hand, to mount his charger. Meanwhile,
Sir Folko was already visible on her
left, at the extremity of the ring, seated on a
graceful light-footed grey horse, with a close-visored
golden helmet on his head. His opponent
not being yet ready, he pranced about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31"></span>in a playful manner along the turf, guiding
his horse, as it seemed, more by words than
by management of the reins. On coming
near Gabrielle, the animal, on a secret signal
from his rider, bent his knees for a moment
in respectful homage, then started up
with a fine capriole, continuing to bound and
curvet so lightly and so elegantly, that he seemed
almost to move on wings; the golden bells
of the saddle and head-gear making pleasant
music, till at length the rider regained his former
position in the distance. There the horse
stood obedient and tranquil like a statue, turning
back his elegantly-formed head towards the
knight, as if in friendly confidence, and asking
whether he had performed his part correctly?
whereupon Sir Folko took off his iron glove,
and kindly clapped him on the neck.</p>

<p>During all this while, it afforded a strange
contrast, to observe how Count Archimbald’s
charger, his dark coat spotted with foam,
plunged, reared, and struggled, so that two
squires, with their utmost exertions, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32"></span>scarcely able to hold him. In the midst of
his fury, the Count sprung upon his back,
and with violent strokes of the spur, made him
plunge more wildly than ever, galloped him
several times up and down with great strength
of limbs and skill of bridle; till at last the
horse knew his master, and stood, as if rooted
to the ground, waiting his commands. Still,
however, his eyes flamed so wildly, that they
might be compared to the red glare of the
torches; and with his right fore-hoof he began
to paw and tear up the turf, as if he would
prepare a grave for his rider’s opponent.</p>

<p>Then both champions, in token that they
were ready for the combat, bowed to Gabrielle
so respectfully, that their long waving
plumes almost touched the earth;—thereafter
they both sat upright, firmly laying their
lances in the rest. At length Gabrielle gave
the signal for onset, by throwing up a white
handkerchief;—the trumpets sounded, and
the two knights rushed against each other
with such velocity, that, contrary to what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33"></span>usually happens, one heard the crashing of
their broken lances and loud ringing of their
armour in the shock, even before his eyes
could distinguish their meeting. The combatants
passed one another without losing
their seats, and now rode their horses up
and down, on exchanged sides of the ring,
each one, as it seemed, wondering to perceive
that his opponent was still in the saddle.
“More lances!” cried Archimbald, and the
squires immediately offered on both sides
a selection among many ponderous weapons.
When they had weighed them, and made
their choice respectively, “Knight of Montfaucon,”
said Archimbald, “two more encounters
with the lance, this and another,
will that suffice? And if the cause be not
then decided, we shall have recourse to the
sword.” “I am here as a guest,” said Folko,
“and must follow whatever example is set by
my noble entertainer.” The trumpets sounded,
and the knights again flew together; this
time, however, with such violence, that both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"></span>horses were thrown back, with their hind-legs
doubled under them, but being violently
spurred, rose again directly, and passed across
into their places. Sir Folko’s lance was broken
into shivers against his adversary’s coat of
mail, while the Count’s spear was merely
snapped, and he held one half still in his hand.
On both sides, therefore, there was a great
shouting and exultation, for the followers of
Waldeck looked on the half weapon still wielded
as a favourable omen, while those of Montfaucon
insisted that their master must have
played his part in a far more knightly and
effectual manner in this encounter.</p>

<p>However this might be, the knights were
once more supplied with lances, the trumpets
sounded for the third time; anger and impatience
rather than their former courtesy
were now visible in every attitude and gesture.
The spectators knew not well how or where
their lances struck on this meeting. Folko’s
silver-grey steed recoiled and reared, then
seemed to tremble and totter from the violence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35"></span>of the shock; but the knight, bending over his
neck, still spurred him on, in a light gallop.
On the other hand, Archimbald’s black charger
fell down on his knees, but instantly rose
again with a violent plunge; then, no longer
tamed by the efforts of his now almost powerless
master, careered about through the ring,
in all the madness of ungovernable rage, so
that he and his strangely-attired rider seemed
like demons rather than mortal beings. At
length with a tremendous bound he leapt
through the torches and disappeared! Thereafter,
from some distance, amid the deep rayless
gloom, one heard by the crash of his
armour that Count Archimbald had been
thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>Folko remained for some time motionless in
his place; then he dismounted, gently stroked
the mane of his silver-grey steed, threw away
the fragment of his broken lance, and, drawing
his sword, that gleamed like a flame in the
torch-light, stepped into the middle of the
circle. No one came to oppose him; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36"></span>from without in the darkness were heard the
anxious murmuring of voices, and the running
to and fro of servants, now busied about
their fallen master. At last Folko called out
in a loud tone, “My Lord Count von
Waldeck, your unruly horse bore you, against
your will, out of the circle. This must not
be reckoned against you; but you shall have
a fair opportunity to make good with your
sword that which you have lost in our contest
with the lance. I shall therefore wait
for you here.” For a long time, however, all
was silent. At last a squire called out,—“My
Lord has fainted.” “He cannot fight
again!” cried another voice. “We must
bring him to the nearest convent to be cured
by the monks,” said a third; and immediately
thereafter was heard the slow and
mournful trampling of the horses as they
bore away the now helpless champion across
the meadow.</p>

<p>Then Sir Folko put up his gleaming sword
into the scabbard, threw back his visor, went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"></span>towards Gabrielle, and, kneeling, begged that
she would bestow on him the prize of the
combat. Weeping bitterly, the beautiful
damsel once more drew the golden chain from
her bosom, with feelings how different from
those with which she had shewn it just before
to the young people! Yet before her trembling
fingers had unclasped the chain, Otto
stepped up to Sir Folko de Montfaucon, and
said,—“Sir Knight, if it please you to allow
that a coat of armour be given me, also a
horse, lance, and sword, I shall yet contend
with you for the ring, in the name of this
noble lady, provided she deems me not unworthy
of such high honour.” At these
words, a glance of hope and joy flew over
Gabrielle’s countenance. In a moment, she
thought of the many old stories in which she
had read of the most renowned knights, and
even giants, having been vanquished by
young men, scarcely beyond the age of boyhood,
who fought in defence of oppressed
damsels. Folko had raised himself from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38"></span>ground, and measured with his looks his unexpected
adversary. Suddenly, however, he
turned away with a smile, and said ironically,
“Young squire! young squire! where are
your golden spurs? Do you think yourself
already qualified to break a lance with knights
in the field? Three sword-strokes on the
shoulders, and a midnight watch of your
armour, then come to me again, and I shall
willingly meet you.” Whereupon he kneeled
again before Gabrielle, and begged her for
the ring; which he had no sooner received
into his hands, than (after making a deep
obeisance) he remounted his silver-grey steed,
and, followed by all his train, galloped away.</p>

<p>Gabrielle, still weeping bitterly, turned to
her attendants, who, directly after the unhappy
issue of the tournament, had begun to
take down the tents, and pack them up, with
all their appurtenances, on led horses; which
work they had now completed. Not a quarter
of an hour longer, said the unhappy lady,
would she remain on the place where she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39"></span>encountered such misfortune. And without
taking heed of Otto’s attempts to console her,
or offers of his services, she turned away from
him as from a prattling foolish child; and,
having mounted her palfrey, rode away
through the darkness. Otto, moreover,
called out after her; “So, may Heaven aid
me, noble lady, as I shall certainly not rest
till I have become a knight, nor till I have
laid the ring at your feet.” Even this vow,
however, seemed to make no impression on
her ears; and in a short time the trampling
of her horse, and noise of her attendants,
died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Lonely and forsaken, Otto and Bertha remained
standing on the fatal place. It was
as if they had dreamed; only the half-burned
torches and the broken turf of the battle-field
bore witness silently that all had been
real. Neither of them knew what to say;
so that in silence they pursued their route
through the darkness of the night homewards,
wonderfully changed in mood from what they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40"></span>had been, when, but a few hours before, they
had come from the castle to that pleasant
meadow. All that passed betwixt them on
the way was only now and then a question
from Otto. “Weep’st thou, dearest Bertha;”
to which she always answered, “No,” in as
firm a voice as she could assume; so that he
was obliged to think himself mistaken, and
that, because he could not help sighing deeply,
he had supposed that Bertha answered him
with her tears.</p>

<p class="center">
How the young Squire Otto received the honours of<br>
Knighthood.
</p>


<p>While all these events had been passing on
the banks of the river, Sir Hugh von
Trautwangen was sitting in his proud ancestral
hall, with its vaulted roof, where were
deposited his own coats of mail and weapons,
along with those of his warlike predecessors.
In this apartment he spent most of his time,
since he had now become too old and infirm
for the sports of the chase or tournament;
and was still less able to pursue the warlike
career to which he had been accustomed in
youth. During this night he was sitting at a
great round table, whereon, in massy silver
candlesticks, there were two wax-lights now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42"></span>almost burned down, while his son and his
niece, contrary to all custom, kept him waiting,
and vainly expecting their arrival. As
often as he heard steps on the long-winding
staircase, the old man thought that must
surely be the two young people, and looked
kindly and anxiously towards the door; but
when it was opened, no one had appeared but
a serving squire, who wished to know whether
the knight still had light enough, or if the
wine in his richly-embossed and carved silver
goblet were drank out. So then Sir Hugh’s
countenance changed; he pretended to be
quite unconcerned, and if the squire expressed
some anxiety, answered briefly and peevishly,
“Well! well! young people must have
their pastime. What business is that of
ours? They will be here soon enough.”</p>

<p>But the castle clock struck nine; then at
length ten o’clock; the night was fearfully
dark, and Sir Hugh had no tidings of his son
nor of his niece. So the old man took his
green velvet cap from his head, held it in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43"></span>his clasped hands, and prayed fervently to
Heaven that the manifold sins of his youth
might not be reckoned against these poor
children, but that Providence, in his infinite
mercy, would bring them back safe to their
home in the castle.</p>

<p>He was still engaged in prayer, when a
heavy oak-pannelled door, right opposite to
him, was opened, and the fresh blooming faces
of the longed-for absentees made their appearance
in the hall. This time he had not heard
the slightest sound on the staircase; and the
fulfilment of his most anxious wishes came
on him unexpectedly, as usually happens,
when one’s wishes have been pure and good,
and especially when one has prayed, in a
right spirit, to the Fountain of all Mercy.
The young people, however, were much distressed;
they were moved to compassion and
repentance, when they saw the tall venerable
form of their guardian sitting in his arm-chair
opposite to them, with clasped hands
and a pale anxious countenance, blanched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44"></span>already by the cares of many past years, and
now rendered paler than ever by the dim
ghastly light of the declining candles. They
felt immediately for whom he had prayed,
and lifted up their clasped hands in the same
manner, in order to express their gratitude,
and beg his forgiveness. Sir Hugh, however,
regained his usual composure, replaced
his velvet cap on his head, and with a
grave, though kindly manner, made signs
that they should come nearer, and desired to
know what had detained them so long?
Then replied Otto von Trautwangen,—“Sir
Knight, and my honoured father, if we had
remained absent but a little longer, it would,
according to my humble thoughts, have been
better for us all, and especially for the beautiful
lady with the ring; for the prize would
have again been contended for, and the victory,
as I hope, would have been ours. Now,
Heaven knows how long I shall have to travel
through the world, in order to fulfil my
vows to the lady; and all this comes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45"></span>because it has not been my fortune ere now to
obtain the rank of knighthood.” On hearing
these words, Sir Hugh looked at his son with
astonishment, not so much on account of the
expressions which he had used, but for the
tone and manner, the complete change that
within a few hours seemed to have taken place
in the youth’s disposition and character.
Bertha, meanwhile, began to weep bitterly,
and without any attempt to conceal her tears;
her affliction was indeed much greater than
that of the beautiful Gabrielle for the loss of
her ring. Hereupon Otto looked round with
surprise, and, observing from his fair cousin’s
eyes, that this was not the commencement
of her distress, (for they were now swollen
and clouded,) he said, in a faltering voice,
“Dearest Bertha, then you have indeed wept
all the way home. Wherefore did you answer
‘no,’ when I questioned you? And, above all,
what is the cause of your affliction?” Bertha
did not utter a word, but answered him only
by a constrained and melancholy smile: then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"></span>she begged of the old knight that she might
be allowed to retire for this evening, and, hiding
her face, directly left the chamber. Otto
wished to detain her; but Sir Hugo, with a
severe look, held him fast bound to his place
at the table. Then, when Bertha had departed,
“Boy,” said the old man, “thou hast
either dreamed and talked wildly, in which
case thy delusions will not last till to-morrow;
or thou art in earnest about vows in a lady’s
service, and the desire of being a knight. If
thou art serious, then thy cousin Bertha’s
childish tears are not of such consequence as
they might have been heretofore. Bring your
chair then directly opposite, and relate accurately,
and with reflection, what happened to
you this evening, so that we may better understand
one another.”</p>

<p>Otto then began his story, and as he advanced,
and described his own feelings on
every incident, Sir Hugh became also more
and more serious and interested; till at length,
when the narrative drew towards a close, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47"></span>could not turn away his eyes from a great
sword, which hung at no great distance from
them on the wall, and which was half drawn
out of the scabbard.</p>

<p>When Otto had concluded his adventure
of the tournament, Sir Hugh kept his eyes
still fixed on the sword. “Many a time,”
said he, “have I endeavoured to bring that
old companion, who has been tried in many
a fray, into the sheath, but nothing will induce
him to move into concealment. It seems
as if he had special objections to rest in obscurity;
and now methinks he has reason on
his side. Come out then once more, old Truepenny!
Otto, fetch him down hither directly.”</p>

<p>It was not without a certain feeling of awe
and perplexity, that the youth turned towards
the object of which his father spoke so
strangely. It seemed almost as if, on his
moving thither, some visitant from another
world would start up against him. Nothing,
however, was visible to his eyes, but the well-known
old weapon;—only that, in the glimmering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48"></span>light, it appeared to shine with mysterious
and unusual brightness. So he laid
hold of it by the golden basket-hilt, and taking
no heed of the scabbard, which fell rattling
on the stone floor of the hall, brought
the drawn sword to his father. “What a
noble blade!” cried he. “The sword worn
by the Knight of Montfaucon did not glitter
more delightfully in the torch-light than this
gleams now!” “Much, no doubt, might be
said about the Knight of Montfaucon and his
sword,” said the old man, weighing the heavy
weapon in his right hand, “much too about
rash vows and other matters; but of these at
a future time, or perhaps better not at all;
for vows once sworn must be fulfilled, and
thy duty to Gabrielle must not be neglected.
Only, if one day, in the course of thy travels,
thou shouldst meet with a jeweller who had
one precious gem, which was the delight of
his heart, by which his eyes would have been
refreshed and strengthened till his dying day,
and from whom this jewel was taken against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49"></span>his will by some tyrannical empress, though
he had fondly hoped never to part with it;
or, moreover, if thou findest a gardener, who
had, in the most sheltered and beautiful parterre,
some one favourite flower which he rejoiced
to tend and to cherish, till at length he
beheld a wicked bird come sweeping down
from the clouds, tear it up, root and branch,
and fly away with it over the seas; if one day
such things should come to pass in thy presence,
then couldst thou guess nearly what
the old knight Hugh von Trautwangen felt
at this moment.”—Thereupon the tears rushed
into his eyes, that from age were now deep
and hollow, and Otto was about to express
the painful emotion with which his father’s
words had inspired him. The knight, however,
stepped firmly and proudly into the
midst of the hall. “Young man,” said he,
“this hour is far too important and solemn
to admit of indulging faint-hearted regret
over events which cannot be recalled. Kneel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50"></span>down then, Herr von Trautwangen, that thou
mayst receive the dignity of knighthood.”</p>

<p>Otto sank on his knees, and devoutly folded
his hands; thus resembling one of those
youthful figures, which we find on ancient
marble monuments, of warriors untimely
slain, with looks of pious simplicity and faith,
waiting the hour of their resurrection. Sir
Hugh, meanwhile, touched his son’s shoulders
three times with the heavy blade, saying,
“Suffer these blows now from my hand, but
never from that of another man!” Then,
drawing himself up to his full height, he said
with solemn dignity, “Herr von Trautwangen;
I have now, in right of my station
as knight and banneret, conferred on you the
full rank of the sacred order to which I belong.
Fulfil your duties henceforth with
honour and integrity, for the protection of
distressed damsels, widows, and orphans;
above all, for the service of our Redeemer
and the glory of our holy religion. For the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51"></span>present, rise up, and let us embrace, like
friendly comrades and brethren in arms.”</p>

<p>Between Sir Hugh and his noble-minded
son there had indeed always subsisted the
utmost friendship and confidence; yet never
had Otto’s heart heaved with so much filial
affection as now, when he had acquired this
proud rank of equality. Thereafter the old
knight stepped, with sword in hand, towards a
great massive shield, that shone like burnished
gold, and hung right over his arm-chair. He
struck on it three times, and at measured intervals,
so that the high-vaulted hall reverberated,
in deep tones like thunder, to the
blows; immediately after which the apartment
was filled with armed squires and
domestics.</p>

<p>Then, holding his son by the hand, he addressed
them. “This,” said he, “is the
brave young knight, Sir Otto von Trautwangen,
and to-night he is to keep watch
over his armour in the chapel. Bring to him,
therefore, the bright coat of mail inlaid with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52"></span>silver, for that shall henceforth be his apparel.
Carry it down to the chapel, and
whoever wishes well to the old oak-tree of
Trautwangen, and this our youngest scion,
let him keep awake and joyous to-night; but
forget not his fervent prayers to Heaven,
that these solemn hours of preparation may
bring forth prosperous and noble fruits, both
for time and eternity. Amen.”</p>

<p>Hereupon they all bent their way down the
long-winding stairs, and afterwards to the
chapel, which, as if for the protection of the
castle, stood at one corner of the outer wall near
the eastern gateway. There the squires laid
down the bright-gleaming armour before the
altar. Sir Hugh placed the great sword in
his son’s hand, and gave him his blessing,
then quitted the chapel with all his attendants.</p>

<p>The young man was thus left alone, and,
with his drawn sword and graceful demeanour,
seemed almost like a supernatural
guardian of the sanctuary.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="c_05">CHAPTER V.</h2></div>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto watched his Armour through the night.
</p>


<p>Aloft in the chapel-roof there shone, from
afar, a single lamp, illuminating in such manner
the fine Gothic arches, with their richly-carved
branches and foliage, that one might
have deemed himself under the shade of a
long leafy avenue in a wood, and have looked
up through the trees for the clear blue light
of heaven. Meanwhile the ground of the
chapel (like the earth itself to the weak eyes
of mortals) remained, with all its forms and
imagery, dim and doubtful. At first the
young knight’s thoughts were wholly devout
and religious. He knelt down with his hands
folded over his sword-hilt, and holding up
the cross, with which it was surmounted, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54"></span>a crucifix before him, lifted up his eyes to
the richly-fretted and illumined church-roof,
reflecting by some natural associations on an
event which had left deep impressions on his
youthful mind. He remembered that his
now sainted mother had died on a journey,
without any other shelter than that of the
forest trees. She was no longer able to speak
with him, but, with sweet smiles and eyes
still intelligent, had pointed to the brightblue
vernal sky that was then visible above
them. With his mother’s death other associations
were soon united, till by degrees his
attention came back again to his situation at
the present moment. It occurred to him,
with a feeling of self-reproach, how little he
had hitherto thought of the chapel in which
he was thus left alone at midnight, and, with
a mixed emotion of curiosity and awe, he
started up from his place at the altar.</p>

<p>Of the various forms that were visible
along the walls, some projected so far, that,
in the play of light and shadow, they almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55"></span>moved and started into life. Others were
only painted on the stone,—shadows themselves
among the grotesque shades, which, by
the lamp-light, were cast from other figures
upon them. It seemed as if all this imagery
must in some way or another be connected
with his father’s past life; of which his knowledge
was only like that which he had just
now acquired of the chapel walls. There
were certain scenes and events clear and intelligible,
others only faintly guessed at or
imagined, and the plan or connexion of the
whole lost in dim twilight. So much was
here plainly visible,—that there were divers
sepulchral monuments, with their sombre
adornments,—divers trophies formed of ponderous
weapons and gigantic armour; for
Sir Hugh had been a great conqueror,—had
travelled not only in the holy oriental lands,
and in the blooming west of Europe, but
into the wild regions of the north, where
there is far more winter than summer, and
where the sun remains for many weeks under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"></span>the horizon. It might be supposed, that
from all these distant climes certain spoils or
tokens had been brought hither, in order to
collect, within the narrow space, proofs how
wide and venturous had been the achievements
of that ancient knight, whose career
was now fast verging to its final close, when
he would be confined within far narrower
limits than even those of the chapel.</p>

<p>Great banners and Mohommetan horse-tails
waved here and there in the night wind;
crooked sabres, with their richly-adorned hilts,
shone beside them, mingled with old rusty
swords and halberts. There were whole
coats of mail ranged as if in battle-array;
and between them appeared sometimes the
hard features of old men carved in stone on
the walls, and sometimes mild female visages,
on which the lamp-light shone like pale
moonshine. Among these there was one by
which the knight was earnestly and irresistibly
attracted. He could scarcely view
it properly, on account of the grim statues
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57"></span>and armorial trophies by which it was environed,
and yet he was convinced that it could
only be the monument of his revered mother.
It seemed as if the figure, with its right hand
outstretched, made signs to him that he
should approach nearer. He would have
gone thither immediately, but knew not whether
it was permitted him by the laws of
knighthood to move so far from his armour,
for the monument was at the further end
of the chapel. A strange conflict then arose
in his mind, which he could by no means
tranquillize. His mother seemed constantly
repeating her signals, till at last he even
thought that he heard her voice, the same
sweet tones recollected from his childhood,
which had often soothed him in his dreams.
“Dearest Otto,” said she, “come hither,
though it were but for one moment! I
have been so long among the dead, and
so far removed from thee! Come then, and
heed not thine armour, for it is under
the protection of Heaven!” The youth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58"></span>was indeed aware that these sounds could not
all come to him from without, but were mostly
the work of his own imagination; however,
his heart was in such degree moved by them,
that at last he kneeled down before the altar,
devoutly begging forgiveness, if he now infringed
the rules of the sacred order to which
he belonged, and thereafter went courageously
towards the monument.</p>

<p>It was indeed the image of his mother,
who was represented in the midst of a forest,
with both hands uplifted to heaven, of which
one only being visible to him from a distance,
it had, therefore, seemed that she had made
him signals. Now lie perceived that she directed
them only towards the Giver of all
Good, for her eyes were fixed on a golden
triangle, which was represented among the
deep-blue clouds. Whatever the figure and
its adornments wanted in freshness and fidelity
of resemblance, the youth’s imagination
(though his eyes were now dim with tears)
failed not to supply. It appeared as if he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"></span>once more beheld actually the same azure
and vernal sky, to which she had pointed at
the hour of her death, and the green living
forest, which then waved so pleasantly around
him. Even this alone,—that the colours
with which the countenance had once been
painted were now faded away,—moved him
unspeakably; for he remembered that his
father, and others who were present, would
not allow him to look on his mother’s pale
and lifeless remains. “And yet,” said he,
“I behold her now as she then was!” He
considered seriously, whether this were not
only the monument, but also the grave of the
departed; but he could not recollect that any
coffin had been deposited in the chapel, or
that he had witnessed any funeral-procession.</p>

<p>Just then a great gust of wind swept
through the aisle. The gates of the church
and castle all groaned and rattled; an old
banner right over his head began to wave
and rustle; so that he started suddenly from
his meditations, and looked anxiously round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60"></span>to his armour. Thereupon a gigantic figure
came forward betwixt him and the altar,
stretching out a long black arm towards the
treasure over which he should have stood
sentinel! Incensed, he directly rushed up to
the dark apparition, and seized on it so violently,
that the helmet which it wore fell
rattling, along with various weapons, to the
ground, while, through the cloud of dust
that rose from the old rusty fragments, a
fleshless skeleton’s head grinned out, as if
scornfully, upon him. With horror he struck
at it with his sword; whereupon the death’s-head,
with the coat of mail and all its appurtenances,
fell to the ground with a tremendous
crash. Then, for the first time, he
perceived plainly that no ghost nor supernatural
visitant had come against him, but
that it was only with one of the lifeless monuments
projecting from the wall with which
he had contended. A new duty thus devolved
on him; he had to collect the whole
together again; to make the old rusty coat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61"></span>of mail stand erect; especially to place the
skull on the shoulders, and surmount it once
more with the ponderous helmet. In the course
of this labour, when he took up the death’s-head,
it appeared that he had inflicted on it a
deep scar with his sword, and could almost
believe that it now grinned on him, not
in scorn, but with pain and torment. This
notion confused him strangely; and when he
had set all to rights, he took off the helmet
once more, in order to be convinced whether
his imagination had misled him. Hereupon
he perceived, that without doubt there were
several wounds on the head, and that one of
them (for he had struck but once) must
have been inflicted by his sword; so that
he hastened to cover up the frightful object.
Returning then to the altar, he knelt down,
and prayed to Heaven for forgiveness of
the error which he had committed, in leaving
the armour, which it was his duty to guard;
in consequence of which the confusion of that
spectral combat had been inflicted upon him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62"></span>It seemed here as if the sacred image of our
Redeemer over the sanctuary looked down
kindly and encouragingly on him; and he was
again tranquillized and cheerful. Sometimes,
if the thought came with a chill shuddering
over him, that his first combat, since he had
been made a knight, had been with a ghastly
defenceless skeleton; then his mother’s mild
voice once more rose on his ears, softly chaunting
four verses which he had often heard in a
ballad composed by Walter the minstrel:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Dark night precedes the morn,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">So grief may joyaunce bring;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And death leads through the wintry grave</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To life’s eternal spring.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, boldly and rejoicingly, he continued
to walk up and down before the altar; and
when the distant pale image once more seemed
to repeat her signals, he only bowed his head,
made a graceful salutation with his sword,
and pointed to his armour, indicating that he
durst not leave his duty. At length the light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63"></span>and fragrance of the morning came to him
through the lofty windows; he heard the key
turn in the massive door-lock, and Sir Hugh
stepped into the chapel.</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto departed from his father’s castle.
</p>


<p>The old and the young knight greeted each
other with a grave and melancholy demeanour.
Sir Hugh then went to the high altar,
lifted up the armour, and began to assist his
son in bracing it on. The youth could hardly
bring himself to receive service from hands so
deeply honoured; but he knew the rules of
knighthood, and therefore said not a word,
whilst his father adjusted the cuirass, the corslet,
the cuisses, finally set the helmet on his
head, and even knelt down in order to buckle
on his golden spurs. Both of them expressed
wonder on finding that the sword-scabbard,
which the old man had brought with him,
now fitted exactly, so that the weapon could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"></span>be drawn out and replaced without trouble,
though heretofore this had been impossible.
“It seems almost,” said Sir Hugh, “as if
this old friend had seen service during the
night. There must be a notch more or less
on the blade!” At these words Otto thought
with horror on his encounter with the skeleton;
and as they passed by the gigantic coat
of mail by which it was covered, he could not
help turning a shy and involuntary glance on
the figure. Sir Hugh observed this, and
said,—“Has <i>he</i> then disturbed you in the
night? At this I should not wonder. Such
at least would have been his conduct when
living.” Otto made no answer, but gazed
wistfully on the strange fashion of the armour,
which in the morning light appeared more
than ever remarkable. His attention was especially
attracted by two vulture’s wings rising
and protruding from the helmet, which, during
the night, he had mistaken for great
horns. At present the figure was indeed
more frightful than it had been even in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66"></span>night; and he called to mind certain marvellous
stories, which his father had long ago told
him, of a horrible man who wore vulture’s
wings on his helmet.</p>

<p>But thereafter they came opposite to the
pale, saintly, and benevolent features of his
mother, and how soon were all impressions of
the death’s-head, the black armour, and vulture’s
wings forgotten! “Is then my mother’s
grave in this chapel?” said Otto, in a tone of
anxious inquiry. Sir Hugh looked mournfully,
and shook his head in silence. “I beg
then,” said the youth, “that some one may direct
me to the spot, wherever it lies, that I may
say my prayers there, as is fitting, before I go
forth into the world. Only through ignorance
has that duty been so long neglected.”
“This is no proper hour to speak of graves,
nor of the dead,” answered Sir Hugh, taking
his son’s arm, and leading him rapidly from
the chapel. Thereafter they came out upon
the ramparts of the castle, amid the fresh fragrant
breezes, while beneath them the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67"></span>landscape unfolded all its varied splendours; the
noble Danube, with its meadows, forests, and
distant mountains, brightened by the long
slanting radiance and dazzling dewdrops of the
morning. “Thou should’st not allow the rein
to such womanish fantasies, young Knight of
Trautwangen,” said the old man, giving his
son a hearty shake; “it will be time enough
for tears, and longings after graves, monuments,
and such like, when thou art as old as I am
now. But even then, such thoughts must be
concealed within thine own breast. Wait here
for the present, and enjoy the freshness of
this May morning. When all is ready for
thy departure thou shalt be sent for.”</p>

<p>The old hero then strode away from the
rampart down to the castle, leaving the youth
cheered and revived in spirit by the reprimand
which he had just received, while his
sanguine hopes of the future always gained
more strength as the landscape grew brighter
around him, and the air was filled with
the music of skylarks, and joyous carolling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68"></span>of shepherds driving out their flocks
on the meadows. While he was thus boldly
stepping up and down, rejoicing in the
martial clang of his weapons and silver
armour, which to his ears harmonized so well
with the gladness that reigned around him,
he happened during his walk to strike on
something concealed among the tall grass,
which also sounded, but with a sad and
mournful tone, as if complaining of unprovoked
injury. Looking down, he perceived
that it was Bertha’s lute, whose mistress must
indeed have been lost in deep reverie, else she
never would have left her beloved companion
so carelessly among the damp moss and unfriendly
dews. So he took up the poor neglected
instrument, pulled off his iron glove,
and seating himself in the grass, prepared,
as well as he could, to console his forsaken
cousin with a farewell melody. He began
with praises of the spring and the beautiful
scenes that were around him; but, alas! he
sang no words that were fitted for Bertha’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69"></span>ears. His fancy was soon kindled by dreams
of the knightly career that awaited him, and
the favour that he would gain by his exploits
from the beautiful Gabrielle. Thus his
melody was indeed jocund, and sounded so
powerfully, that Bertha was attracted by the
notes, and came unobserved to his side, with
looks how changed from those which she had
worn the preceding day! Her eyes were indeed
still bright, but it was her tears only
that glittered in the sun. “And this is then
in truth your farewell song?” said she. Otto
remained for a space silent and meditative,
then answered,—“Dearest Bertha, that song
has indeed expressed more than I intended;
more indeed than I was well conscious of ere
it was begun. Like the flowers, and the
brightness of the new year, my own newly-awakened
hopes and prospects dawned on my
mind, and carried me quite away. For
listen, dearest Bertha! We cannot longer
disguise it from each other, that whatever
this music has accidentally betrayed is but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70"></span>the truth. The strange lady, with her beauty
and distress, has got complete possession of
my heart, which is for the first time inspired
with a chivalrous and knightly passion. Take
courage then and be merry! Ere long there
will doubtless appear some wandering knight-errant,
who will arrive here as unexpectedly
as Gabrielle has done, and for whose sake you
will soon forget the fond foolish Otto.”</p>

<p>“Such a knight will never come hither,”
said Bertha, mournfully; “and as for the
distress of that lady, perhaps I too—” Here
she blushed deeply, and was silent. “Nay,”
said Otto vehemently, and starting up, “if
you indeed should ever be in distress, then
would I think of no other. My life and all
my endeavours should be devoted to you
alone.” “I shall not, however, choose you
for my champion, Knight of Trautwangen,”
said Bertha, proudly and coldly. “Believe
me, if our pagan foes, as we read in the old
histories, had bound me to the stake, with
the devouring flames kindling around me,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71"></span>and you came up on horseback, arrayed in
your bright armour as you are now, to offer
your assistance, I would only say,—‘Thanks!
I have no need of such a defender!’ and
would cry out, ‘Pile on more flaming
brands;’ and then I would extinguish them
even with my tears; and yet methinks no!
that might not be, for they are already too
scorching!” With these words, weeping bitterly,
she sank down upon the grass, and
Otto, in the conflict of his feelings, accidentally
drew his hand across the harp, so
that one of the strings broke, with a long
mournful intonation. Bertha raised herself
up at the sound. “Mark,” said she, “how
you treat all that belongs to me! Why have
you first pulled off your iron gloves? With
them you might have sooner broke my unfortunate
harp into pieces. Give it to me, Sir
Knight! This poor remembrance at least
remains mine.” So she took the instrument
vehemently out of his hands, and ran away.
He called after her, but she only rocked the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72"></span>lute in her arms, as if it had been a child that
had received some injury, drawing from it all
the while mild and heart-moving tones, till,
without once looking round, she vanished
from his sight behind the chapel.</p>

<p>The stern deep voice of the old knight was
now heard from the court, calling out repeatedly,
“All is ready, all is ready! Sir Otto,
come hither and mount your horse!” The
youth then hastened down from the rampart,
and found a number of cavalry squires in
attendance; three of whom were holding by
golden reins a light-brown charger, which he
had often seen before, but had never dared
to mount. On his appearance among them,
“Young knight,” said Sir Hugh, with a
forced smile, “parting and delay are both
painful,—is it not so? Well, think then no
more of the matter, but mount directly, and
try how this noble steed will bear his new
rider.” The young Sir Otto immediately
sprang into the saddle, and rode his horse up
and down with such extraordinary strength
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73"></span>and agility, that all the by-standers expressed
their admiration, insisting that this animal,
whose disposition had been before wild and
untameable, had at last found out and acknowledged
his proper master. The venerable
old knight was delighted, and stretched
out his arms towards Sir Otto. “Dismount
once more, dearest son,” cried he, “that ere
you finally depart I may embrace and bless
you.” Whereupon the youth threw himself
from his horse with a great clang and rattle
of his armour, and rushed into his father’s
arms. The horse meanwhile snorted and
plunged, till he had pulled the bridle from
the hands of the squires, then trotted after
his young master, stood quietly beside him,
and even laid his head caressingly on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, my son, depart in God’s name,”
said Sir Hugh; “your attendants are already
mounted and in waiting.” “There is yet
one request which I had to prefer,” answered
the youth, “and this perhaps my honoured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74"></span>father will not refuse to grant. It may be
the last which I shall ever make here; for I
must travel into far-distant lands, and have
many a hard battle to encounter.” “My
son,” said Sir Hugh, “one must avoid all
words that sound like a foreboding of evil.
Misfortune is ready enough to seize hold of
every mortal, and the obstacles which often
stand insurmountable betwixt us and our
desires, form an easy and convenient ladder
for our adversary to mount into our chambers.
Therefore do not speak to me of last
requests and so forth; but tell me at once
what are your wishes, and they shall be
fulfilled.” “Sir Knight,” answered Otto,
“so far as I have yet heard or read of
heroes and their exploits, they have always
on their first adventures rode out alone.
Such was the conduct of the great Seyfried,
and of every one else that is most renowned.
You have spoken, however, of a train to
attend me; and I see a great number of
armed horsemen in waiting; but I entreat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75"></span>that you will not thus send me forth like
a spoiled child, who needs guidance and protection,
but as a stout and wise champion,
who, by his own independent strength, can
both defend himself and afford assistance to
others.” Hereupon Sir Hugh immediately
ordered all the horsemen to dismount; “for,”
said he, “my son has in such manner justified
his request, that whatever my own wishes
might be, it were a sin if I refused it to
him. And now, young knight,” added he,
“do not any longer delay your departure,
for otherwise your old father’s heart will
at last be too much moved. One injunction,
however, I must yet offer you. Behave
as courteously towards the Knight of
Montfaucon as the circumstances of your
vow will permit; for, in his detention of the
ring, he is not guilty of such injustice as you
believe.”</p>

<p>Upon these words, Sir Otto flew, swift
almost as a bird, into the saddle, and rode
directly out of the court, while his old father
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76"></span>returned, weeping bitterly, to his now lonely
chambers. In his affliction, however, he appeared
so dignified and worthy of respect, that
no one of the household had courage then to
meet his looks, or even go into his presence.</p>

<p>Just as Otto von Trautwangen came along
at a hard trot across the meadow below the
castle, Bertha and the old minstrel Walter
were seated on the rampart, and looked
mournfully down on his progress; for Bertha
had confided all her sufferings and sorrow to
the old man, who happened at this time to
have made one of his accustomed visits to
the castle. She was about to break out afresh
into an agony of tears, when Master Walter
said,—“Nay, nay, let us sing a farewell
address to the young knight on his departure.”
He then took his harp, and sung one
stanza, to which Bertha responded; but as
the minstrel began again, she made him
a signal to be silent, for she could bear it no
longer. Her voice faltered, and she wrapt
herself closely in her veil. Meanwhile the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77"></span>soft notes of their music were borne down by
the morning breezes to Sir Otto, who spurred
his horse, and drew down his visor as if resolved
to hear no more. It was the first time
that he had ever worn a close helmet; and as
he looked through its bars on the vernal
landscape, his heart heaved within him, and
was filled with new and strange sensations.
The whole world appeared new and mysterious;
but the bright roseate hues of the
eastern sky prevailed in his mind, and over
the scenery. He shouted aloud, encouraged
his noble horse, and, like a new-fledged bird
or butterfly of spring, pursued his way over
fields, woods, and meadows, forgetting all
sorrow in his bright prospects of the future.</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto vanquished Sir Heerdegen von Lichtenried.
</p>


<p>In that smiling land, where the silver-blue
Mayne rolls its waters past the old free town
of Frankfort, where, on both sides, are situated
the most attractive villages and garden-houses,
vineyards and pleasure-grounds, life is indeed
joyous and delightful! Whoever has the good
fortune to be there in the vernal season of
flowers and blossoms, especially if he be a
young warrior, with his heart full and buoyant
with grand and lofty anticipations, may
quaff for once a cup of pleasure such as the
whole course of his after-life may not offer to
his lips. The truth of what has just now
been said is known to the writer of this history
from his own experience; and he heartily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79"></span>wishes that his readers may have proved it
also, both for their own sakes, and in order
that they may better sympathize with the
feelings, which, as it were, spread a golden
web of enchantment over all the objects by
which the youthful Otto was now surrounded.
He knew not what to look upon as most
interesting, the thoughts of his journey and
warlike exploits,—the blooming fairy-land,
with its orchard-trees, winding-walks and
avenues, varied hills and dales, in which he was
placed; or, finally, the mirthful and courteous
people by whom this land was inhabited.</p>

<p>In such mood of mind he rode up to a
house for the entertainment of travellers,
which was situated not far from the banks of
the river, and whose inviting portico of vines
and jasmines determined him to alight and
rest here at least till after mid-day. His
noble charger was duly led into the stable, and
supplied with provender, though the knight
must himself attend to this duty, as the
faithful and attached animal would not allow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80"></span>any one else to come near him. At last Sir
Otto was seated in the portico, with a flask of
old Rudisheimer before him, which, as he
poured out a full glass, shone like liquid gold
amid the light that came flickering through
the dark-green foliage of the arbour.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a man happened to come
out from the house into the portico, not much
older than Otto in years, but of a sombre,
sunburnt visage, accoutred as a knight, and
with his whole armour dusty and rusted, as if
from a long journey. His weapons too were
without ornament, and buckled on in such a
manner, that it was obvious the stranger
cared not for external appearances; and he
must have afforded a remarkable contrast to
the youth, in his bright silver coat of mail,
whom he now found sitting over his wine in the
arbour. The stranger’s salutation was courteous,
though in a tone which betrayed somewhat
of moroseness and discontent. He took
his place opposite to the Knight of Trautwangen,
and also demanded wine. The latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81"></span>was at first by no means well satisfied with his
companion, believing that such an intruder
would put to flight all the fairy-visions which
the pleasant scene around him had inspired,
without offering by his discourse any desirable
compensation. He soon discovered, however,
that the stranger belonged to that class of
people who are justly compared to rough
diamonds, to hard ordinary-looking pebbles,
that when struck, yield bright sparks, or to
the dingy masses of ore from which the alchemist
at last brings forth pure gold. He had
travelled through many distant countries, yet
had never lost his original character,—that of
an honest unaffected German; or such attributes
had been strengthened rather than
weakened, as the more he had observed of
other countries the more deeply he had been
aware of his exclusive attachment to his
native land. The conversation, when once
begun, proved interesting to both parties, and
they soon found themselves in such good
humour, that they were not displeased when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82"></span>a third party made his appearance from the
house and joined their table. This was a
young merchant, named Theobaldo, of Italian
birth, who had been sent by his relations
in the south to study the commerce of this
flourishing town. Among much other discourse,
the strange knight in the rusty
armour related the following history, to which
they listened with great attention.</p>

<p>“In the distant northern kingdom of
Sweden, there are not only people yet living
under the clouds of ignorance and pagan
superstition, but, especially on the borders of
Finland, are many unfortunate victims of
witchcraft and necromancy, which arts are
still practised there by magicians and sorcerers,
who can bring against their enemies all
sorts of evil in body, goods, and estate.
Just on the Finland frontier there is situated
a high mountain, which, on the Swedish
side, is covered with beautiful copsewood,
and on the other with dark pine-trees, so
closely ranked together, and so luxuriant in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83"></span>shade, that one might almost say, the smallest
bird could not find his way through the
thickets. Below the copsewood there stands
a chapel with the image of St George, as
guardian of the land, and a defence against
the dragons, (if there be such,) and other
monsters of paganism; while on the other
side, on the borders of the dark fir-wood,
are certain cottages inhabited by wicked
sorcerers, who have, moreover, a cave cut
so deep into the mountain, that it joins
with the bottomless abyss, whence come all
the devils that assist them. The Swedish
Christians, who dwelt in the neighbourhood
of this mountain, thought it would be necessary,
besides the chapel and statue of St
George, to choose some living protector, and
therefore selected an ancient warrior, highly
renowned for his prowess in the battle-field,
and who had in his old age become a monk.
When this man went to take up his abode
on the mountains, his only son (for he had
formerly lived as a married man in the world)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84"></span>would on no account leave him; but lived
there also, assisting his father in his duties as
watcher, and in the exercises of prayer and
penitence, fully equalling the example that was
now afforded him, as he had formerly done
by his bravery as a soldier. The life here
led by those two valiant champions is said to
have been most edifying and pious.</p>

<p>“Once on a time it happened, that the young
hero went out to cut wood in the forest. He
bore a sharp axe on his shoulders, and was
besides girded with a great sword; for, as the
woods were not only full of wild beasts, but
also haunted by wicked men, the pious
hermits took the precaution of always going
armed. While the good youth was forcing
his way through the thickest of the copsewood,
and already beheld over it the pointed
tops of the fir-trees, (for he was close
on the Finland frontier,) there rushed out
against him a great white wolf, so that he had
just time enough to leap to one side, and not
being able immediately to draw his sword, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"></span>flung the axe at his assailant. The blow was
so well aimed, that it struck one of the wolf’s
fore-legs, who being cruelly wounded, limped
back, with a yell of anguish, into the wood.
The young hermit-warrior, however, thought
to himself, “It is not enough that I am rescued,
but I must take such measures that
no one else may in future be injured, or even
terrified by this wild beast.” So he rushed in
as fast as possible among the fir-trees, and
inflicted such a vehement blow with his sword
on the wolf’s head, that the animal, moaning
piteously, fell to the ground. Hereupon
there came over him all at once a strange
mood of regret and compassion for his poor
victim. Instead of putting it immediately to
death, he bound up the wounds, as well as he
could, with moss and twigs of trees, placed it
on a sort of canvass sling, on which he was
in the habit of carrying great faggots, and
with much labour brought it home, in hopes
that he might be able at last to cure and tame
his fallen adversary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86"></span></p>
<p>“He did not find his father in the cottage,
and it was not without some fear and anxiety
that he laid the wolf on his own bed, which
was made of moss and rushes, and over which
he had painted a figure of St George and the
dragon. He then turned to the fire-place of
the small hut, in order to prepare a healing
salve for the wounds; but, when thus occupied,
how was he surprised to hear the
moanings and lamentations of an articulate
voice from the bed on which he had just before
deposited the wolf! On returning thither,
his astonishment was inexpressible on perceiving,
instead of the frightful wild beast, a
most beautiful damsel, on whose head the
wound which he had inflicted was bleeding
through her fine golden hair, and whose right
arm, in all its grace and snow-white luxuriance,
was stretched out motionless, for it had
been broken by the blow from his axe!
“Pray,” said she, “have pity, and do not
kill me outright. The little life that I have
still left is indeed painful enough, and may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"></span>not last long,—yet sad as my condition is, it
is yet tenfold better than to die!”—The
young man then knelt down weeping beside
her, and she explained to him how she was
the daughter of a magician on the other side
of the mountain, who had sent her out in the
shape of a wolf to collect plants from places
which, in her own proper form, she could not
have reached. It was but in terror that she
had made that violent spring, which the youth
had mistaken for an attack on him, when her
only wish had been to pass him by. “But
you directly broke my right arm,” said she,
“though I had no evil design against you!”
How she had now regained her proper shape
she could not imagine; but to the youth it
was quite clear, that the picture of St George
and the dragon had broken the spell by
which the poor girl had been transformed.</p>

<p>“While the son was thus occupied, the old
man returned home, and soon learned all that
had occurred, perceiving, at the same time,
that if the young pagan wanderer had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88"></span>released from the spells by which she had been
bound, the youth was in his turn enchanted,
and spell-bound by her beauty and amiable
behaviour.</p>

<p>“From that moment he exerted himself to
the utmost, for the welfare of her soul, endeavouring
to convert her to Christianity,
while his son attended to the cure of her
wounds; and, as their endeavours were on
both sides successful, it was resolved among
them, that the lovers should be united in holy
bonds of matrimony, for the youth had not
yet restricted himself by any monastic vows.</p>

<p>“The magician’s daughter was now restored
to perfect health; a day had been appointed
for her baptism and marriage, before which
it happened that the bride and bridegroom
went to take a pleasure-walk one evening
through the woods. The sun was yet high
in the west, and shone so fervently through
the beech-trees on the green turf, that they
could never resolve on returning home, but
always came deeper and deeper into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89"></span>forest. Then the bride told him stories of
her early life; and sang old songs, which she
had learned when a child, and which sounded
beautifully amid the woodland-solitude.
Though the words were such that they could
not be agreeable to the youth’s ears, (for she
had learned them among her pagan and
wicked relations,) yet he could not interrupt
her; first, because he loved her so dearly;
and, secondly, because she sung in a voice so
clear and sweet, that the whole forest seemed
to rejoice in her music. At last, however,
the pointed heads of the pine-trees again became
visible, and the youth wished to turn
back, in order that he might not come again
too near the accursed Finland frontier. His
bride, however, said to him,—“Dearest
Conrad,” (for that was his name,) “why
should we not walk on a little farther? I
would gladly see the very place where you
wounded me so cruelly on the head and arm,
and made me a prisoner; all which has in the
end only contributed to my happiness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90"></span>Methinks we are now very near the spot.” Accordingly
they sought about here and there,
till at last the twilight fell dim and heavily on
the dense woods. The sun had long since set;
the moon had risen, however, and as her light
broke forth the lovers stood on the Finland
frontier,—or rather they must have gone
already some distance beyond it, for the
bridegroom was exceedingly terrified when
he found his cap lifted from his head, as if
by a human hand, though this was only the
branch of a fir-tree. Immediately thereafter
the whole air around them was filled
with strange and supernatural beings,—witches,
devils, dwarfs, horned owls, fire-eyed
cats, and a thousand other wretches that
could not be named or described, whirled
around them as if dancing to rapid music;
at which, when the bride had looked on for a
while, she broke out into loud laughter, and
at last began to dance furiously along with
them. The poor bridegroom might shout
and pray, as much and as earnestly as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91"></span>would, for she never attended to him, but at
last transformed herself in a manner so extraordinary,
that he could not distinguish her
from the other dancers in that abominable
waltz. He thought, however, that he had
kept his eyes upon her, and seized on one of
the dancers; but, alas! it was only a horrible
spectre who held him fast, and threw her
wide-waving shroud around him, so that he
could not make his escape; while, at the same
time, some of the subterraneous black demons
pulled at his legs, and wanted to tear him
down along with them into their bottomless
caves.</p>

<p>“Fortunately he happened at that moment
to cross himself, and call on the name of our
Saviour; upon which the whole of this vile
assembly fell into confusion. They howled
aloud, and ran off in all directions; while, in
the mean time, he saved himself by recrossing
the frontiers, and getting under the protection
of the Swedish copsewood. His beautiful
bride, however, was completely lost, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92"></span>by no endeavours could he ever obtain her
again, though he often came to the Finland
border, called out her name aloud, wept and
prayed; but all in vain! Many times, it is true,
he saw her floating about through the pine-trees,
as if in the chase, but she was always
accompanied by a train of frightful creatures,
and she herself also looked wild and disfigured.
For the most part she never noticed
Conrad; but, if she could not help fixing her
eyes on him, she laughed so immoderately,
and in a mood of merriment so strange and
unnatural, that he was terrified, and made
the sign of the cross; whereupon she always
fled away howling into the thickets. He
fell more and more into melancholy abstraction,
hardly ever spoke, and though he had
given over his vain walks into the forest, yet,
if one asked him any question, the only answer
he returned was, “Ay, she is gone
away beyond the mountains!”—so little did
he know or remember of any other object in
the world but the lost beauty! At last he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93"></span>died of grief;—and, according to a request
which he had once made, his father prepared
a grave for him on the place where the bride
was found and lost; though, during the fulfilment
of this duty, he had enough to do, one
while in contending with the crucifix against
evil spirits, and at another with his sword
against wild beasts, which were no doubt sent
thither by the magicians to attack and annoy
him. At length, however, he brought his
task to an end, and thereafter it seemed as
if the bride mourned for the youth’s untimely
death; for there was heard often a sound of
howling and lamentation at the grave. For
the most part indeed this noise is like the
voices of wolves, yet, at the same time, human
accents are to be distinguished, and I myself
have often listened thereto on dark winter
nights.”</p>

<p>The knight in rusty armour having concluded
his story, all three sat for some time
silent and meditative,—till at length Theobaldo
began to speak. “The cureless wounds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94"></span>of unfortunate love; the loss, or, much more,
the changed heart of one whom we held most
dear, and to whom, though changed, we yet
feel an unconquerable attachment, are indeed
among the most fearful causes of distress to
which we are in this life subjected. I remember
a story somewhat alike in this respect to that
which we have now heard; and if my worthy
companions are inclined to listen, am ready
to narrate it.” Both knights assured him
that they would be deeply attentive, and he
proceeded as follows:—“It may be about
twenty-five or thirty years since there lived,
in my native town of Milan, a young maiden,
who was not only amiable in temper, but
such a paragon of beauty, as only some
great master in painting, or sculpture, could
imagine in a summer night’s dream. At the
same time she was modest, quiet, retired, and
humble; though, notwithstanding this disposition,
as a diamond will shine even amid the
deepest shade, she became known and admired
through the whole town, under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95"></span>name of the beautiful Lisberta. This flower
of the Milanese damsels was one day invited
to make her appearance, adorned with garlands
and in festal attire, at a religious procession, in
order that her extraordinary charms might
heighten its effect on beholders; and, as
she considered this but as the fulfilment of
a pious duty, she agreed to the request
which had been urged upon her. She, therefore,
adorned herself in the best manner with
the richest dress, flowers, jewels, rings, and
gold chains,—finishing her toilette, however,
long before the procession was ready to commence;
so that, having some time at her own
disposal, and invited by the pleasant fragrant
air of spring, she resolved to take a walk in
the garden, which had been tastefully laid out
round her father’s house, who was one of the
richest men in Milan.</p>

<p>“On her way through the long avenues
and shady walks, wherein were the rarest
fruit-trees and flowering plants, she came
to the borders of a lake clear as crystal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96"></span>which lay there like a sleeping beauty in the
arms of the green thickets by which it was
environed. As if bound by magic spells to
the spot, she stood on the water’s brink, looking
at her reflected image, in all her pomp of
dress and glittering jewels; so that, like the
fabulous Narcissus of old, she could not help
wondering at her own attractions. At last, she
forced herself, by a kind of vehement effort,
to fix her eyes on the real objects by which
she was surrounded, in order that she might
escape from the delusions of the watery
mirror, and thus became aware of something
among the grass, which glittered like
burnished gold and silver. Glad of aught
that could divert her attention, and desirous
to know what extraordinary meadow-flower
this could be that shone so brightly, she
hastened to the spot, and found, to her great
surprise, that it was a highly-polished sword,
with a golden hilt, a scabbard bound with
silver, and altogether of a most elegant
fashion. She took it up, as if it had been a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97"></span>mere toy, notwithstanding the terror which
she usually entertained of such warlike instruments;
nay, she even drew it half out of
the sheath, and wondered to find that her
features were now reflected in greater beauty
from the polished steel than they had been
before from the water, while at the same time
she felt less apprehension and perplexity.
Alas! poor Lisberta, thou hadst then unwittingly
the means of thine own destruction in
thy hands, which, like a merciless sickle, was
to cut down thy life and happiness like a May
flower in bloom! Though the sword alone would
not cause such misfortune, yet thou wert
destined to fall the victim of him by whom
it was usually worn and wielded.</p>

<p>“From amid the verdant thickets stepped
forward a knight in full armour,—no longer
a youth, but yet not old, and with such indescribable
heroic dignity in his person and demeanour,
that, on his appearance, the beautiful
Lisberta, from an involuntary emotion of
respect, had almost fallen on her knees before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98"></span>him. “Fairest of damsels,” said the knight,
“beware of wounding yourself with that
sharp-edged weapon. Far rather would I see
my heart’s blood streaming from my veins,
than even the slightest drop from these
snow-white hands!” Thereupon, with the
greatest respect, he took from her the sword,
placing it again in the belt by his side,
and before he had time to say more, the servants
came into the garden, calling aloud
for Lisberta, as the procession had already
begun. The shy timid girl hastily made a
sign to the knight that he should withdraw,
and, after a respectful obeisance, he disappeared
immediately through the green hedges
by which the garden was enclosed.</p>

<p>“How confusedly the procession, the singing
of the choir, and the applause of the multitude,
were blended and lost to the senses of
Lisberta, I need not further describe; besides,
my heart bleeds to think of the fate
which awaited the poor victim; and thus I
have dwelt too long on the circumstances of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99"></span>her early life, well knowing how melancholy
were the events that attended her afterwards.
From this point then allow me to proceed
more quickly towards the end.</p>

<p>“In the evening after the festival, when she
was sitting lost in thought at her window,
the declining sun shone so brightly and
beautifully, that she could not help observing
one of her favourite flowers,—a tall and
slender plant, which had broke loose from
the rushes with which it had been tied up,
and now hung down from the veranda towards
the terrace-walk below. On her endeavouring
to restore the plant to its former
station, she observed a figure passing
through the garden, in which she recognised
but too plainly, the knight with whom she had
spoken in the morning,—the owner of that
brightly gleaming sword. In all haste she
tied up the flower, and would have retreated;
but what was her surprise to find a letter
attached thereto, which no doubt had been
the work of that mysterious wanderer. On
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100"></span>unfolding and reading it, she indeed found
that it was a love-letter from him, and that
he was a renowned knight from a distant
country, who, in the town of Milan, was
known by the name of Signor Uguccione,
and of whose warlike exploits and amiable
conduct she had already heard many wonderful
stories. Her heart, therefore, which
was already moved in his favour, soon
yielded, when she thought of the high praises
that had been bestowed on him. The blooming
plant was ere long loosed again from its
support, and sent down with her love-embassy,
in reply to that which she had received;—and
soon after returned with another
letter from Uguccione. In this way
salutations went and came, till at last Lisberta
herself went down by moonlight by the private
staircase which led into the garden; for in the
night hours she was sure that no one would
come to disturb their conversation.</p>

<p>“It happened, after some time, however,
that though Lisberta’s letters were sent down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101"></span>as usual, yet no one came thither to take them
from their verdant envelope. When she drew
up the plant, she found them, alas! unopened.
At last she began to make inquiries after
Uguccione, and learned that many days ago
he had vanished, in a manner the most unaccountable,
from Milan. Yet every night
the unfortunate damsel used to bend the plant
down as usual to the terrace, and if she drew
it up and found no letter, she always wept
bitterly. This was continued so long, that at
last, by such continual grief, her heart was
broken. After her death and funeral, a lady
who had won her confidence made the fatal
flower be planted on her grave; and I have
often beheld it there, spreading its green shade
and fragrance over that lonely and mournful
place.”</p>

<p class="center">
The Combat with Sir Heerdegen von Lichtenried.
</p>


<p>During the relation of this story, a deep
gloom had gathered always more and more
over the countenance of Theobaldo, so that
by the time he had got to the end he seemed
quite changed; and now, instead of being a
careless merry companion, looked like one
whose whole hopes are buried in the grave
with some beloved object.</p>

<p>After a pause he said, “You must forgive
me, noble warriors, if I have, by such a narrative,
thrown a cloud on this happy meeting,
and as it were dimmed the lustre of your
bright old Rudisheimer. For the most part,
I myself am cheerful enough, and can enjoy
a goblet of wine, and the sportive conversation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103"></span>of my companions; only, that the mournful
events which I have just related come now and
then betwixt me and all pleasure; and, until
I have relieved my mind by repeating them,
I cannot obtain any rest. This happens, because
my relations have so often led me to
Lisberta’s grave, and told me so much of her
beauty, and her sufferings from the treachery
of the stranger knight, that the story has
been deeply impressed, even from childhood,
on my mind. If this Signor Uguccione should
ever fall in my way, he may look to his own
safety as he best can; for I could scarcely
imagine a greater pleasure, than to stab him
to the heart with his own bright sword, and
at the same moment to call aloud in his ears,
‘Lisberta, Lisberta!’”</p>

<p>At these words, his eyes gleamed like two
fiery beacons, from the vehemence of his emotion;
but Otto scarcely perceived this, and
had attended but little to what now passed.
His whole heart was still fixed on the
story and distresses of the forsaken Lisberta,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104"></span>till at last his melancholy found relief in words,
and he began to relate to his companions the fortunes
of his own life, but in the third person, as
if the events had happened to another. Thus,
he told them how happily he had lived on the
banks of the Danube with his beloved cousin
Bertha; but now a more powerful attachment
had led him away from his home, and
induced him to break these early ties; adding,
how the two stories of unfortunate lovers
had brought his attention painfully back to his
forsaken cousin. To conclude, he could not
help, in the simplicity of his heart, asking his
companions whether they believed that Bertha
too would die of grief, like the hermit of the
forest, and the betrayed beauty of Milan.</p>

<p>Hereupon the strange knight in rusty
armour looked him sternly in the face, and,
with a tone and demeanour so changed, that
it seemed as if all the friendly feelings that
he had before expressed had been frozen to
ice within him; he said,—“As thou hast
spoken so much of the Danube’s pleasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105"></span>banks, and of a damsel named Bertha, perchance
thou art called Otto von Trautwangen,
and thy fair cousin is the Lady von
Lichtenried?” Scarcely had Sir Otto answered
in the affirmative, when the stranger rose up,
placed the massive helmet which he had
brought out with him upon his head, and
said,—“It is good that we have thus met
one another; for I am the Knight Heerdegen
von Lichtenried, Bertha’s brother, who, after
long laborious pilgrimages through the world,
have now returned home, in hopes of finding
my sister grown up in the bloom of health
and beauty. I have been fortunate therefore
in the opportunity granted me of avenging
her wrongs on such a conceited and foolish
babbler as thou art!” The conclusion of this
discourse quite stifled in Otto’s heart the wish
for reconciliation which he might otherwise
have entertained, and in vehement haste he
started up, in order to find his sword and helmet.
Meanwhile, as he was thus arranging his
armour, the Italian wished to interpose a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106"></span>words of mediation; but Heerdegen answered
him sternly, “Give yourself no trouble; if
this young coxcomb, with his silver bright
armour, has spoken the truth, then he ought
to fall the victim of my revenge; if, on the
other hand, he has uttered unmeaning and
groundless words, he deserves, notwithstanding,
chastisement for that fault.” By this time
Otto stood prepared at the entrance of the
portico, and pointed to a thicket of trees
which stood below on the banks of the river.
Sir Heerdegen immediately set himself to close
his rusty visor, which was effected with a great
crash, then placed himself by the side of his
opponent, and they walked together towards
the intended field of battle. Theobaldo,
meanwhile, who seemed now delighted with
what was going forward, moved briskly,
sometimes before, and sometimes after them.</p>

<p>“Noble sirs,” said he, when they had
come about half-way, “forgive me if I seem
thus cheerful, when you have business so
tragical on your hands. But through my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107"></span>whole life I have never wished so much for
any sight that is recreative and reviving to the
beholder, as a real combat for life and death,
between two heavily-armed and valiant champions.
Such an encounter I would often have
tried willingly at the risk of my own life;
but it has never been my fortune hitherto to
engage in conflict with any assailants better
than light-armed cowardly banditti. And when
people make pretended fights together, nothing,
in my opinion, can be more contemptible
and ridiculous. I consider myself fortunate,
therefore, as I shall to-day behold a
glorious encounter; for I am thoroughly convinced
that you will both conduct yourselves
like well-proved and undaunted heroes.”</p>

<p>Amid the thickets of the copsewood, the
two knights soon discovered a free open glade,
with smooth turf, which was well fitted for
their combat. Without making farther conditions,
or even interchanging a word, they
directly took their places, drew their swords,
and attacked one another with great wrath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108"></span>and violence, while Theobaldo composedly
took his station as a looker-on, leaning against
a high lime-tree. The whole air rung with
the clashing of their swords, though not one
blow hit effectively, but was either driven
back by the shield or by their plumed helmets,
so that the ground, instead of being
stained with blood, was strewed with partycoloured
feathers. During the conflict, Sir
Heerdegen’s voice was always heard from
the hollow of his rusty beaver, calling aloud,
“Bertha! Bertha!” and it seemed often
as if Otto recoiled at this exclamation,
though he still repelled every stroke of his
enemy’s sword. Perceiving this, Heerdegen
redoubled his blows, and Sir Otto continued
merely to ward them off as well as he
could, without, as it appeared, attempting to
make any farther attack, till at last his shield
was cut in two, and he had only one half
left in his hand. Then his rage suddenly
broke out like that of a wounded lion;—as if
a lightning-flash of inspiration had kindled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"></span>within his heart, he threw aside the broken
remnant of his shield,—and from his silver
helmet were heard the silvery tones of his
youthful voice, pronouncing fervently the
name, “Gabrielle! Gabrielle!” At the same
time he held his sword grasped in both hands,
and therewith inflicted such a storm of blows
on his opponent’s head, breast, and shield-arm,
that suddenly a stream of blood burst from
the visor of Sir Heerdegen. At the moment
when Sir Otto perceived this, he held
back his sword, and the wounded knight,
being no longer able by any effort to support
himself, fell powerless, with a great
crash of his armour, upon the grass.</p>

<p>Theobaldo and Otto kneeled beside him to
render their assistance. The helmet, already
almost broken in pieces by the vehemence of
Otto’s last attack, was quickly loosed, and
Sir Heerdegen’s visage was found covered
with blood. Otto, who was well skilled (as
every knight ought to be) in the healing
art, washed it carefully away; whereupon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110"></span>it was discovered, that the wound began
on the right side of the forehead, from whence
it stretched across between the eyebrows, and
came down over the right cheek. A proper
bandage was provided, and securely fixed;
but the knight continued to lie there insensible
and motionless, as if he were already
dead, and in his pale visage, now divested of
its former stem expression, a resemblance to
Bertha was clearly discernible. As he thus
bent over his fallen foe, Sir Otto wept bitterly.
An old story came now to his remembrance,
which Sir Hugh had often related of
a knight, who, in the confusion of the battle-field,
had slain his beloved mistress, who was
dressed in a coat of mail, which he mistook
for that of an enemy; and now he almost
accused himself of being Bertha’s murderer.
“Ay,” said he to himself, “I deserve no other
name. The careless mood in which I took my
departure inflicted the first deadly blow, and
with her brother’s life I have cut asunder the
last ties that bound her to this world!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111"></span></p>
<p>The young merchant reminded him, that it
was now time to carry the wounded man back
to their inn, for the evening was drawing on,
and rest in bed was, of all remedies, the
most needful. Thereupon they took up their
yet insensible companion, and bore him away
on their shoulders in such manner, that Theobaldo
alone had his head to support; “for,”
said Otto mournfully, “if he should awake on
the road, he would rather behold your countenance
than mine; while, on the other hand,
his features remind me so painfully of the
forsaken Bertha, that I dare not look on
him.” After his arrival at the inn, where
he was attended by two of his own squires,
Sir Heerdegen again recovered his senses;
and on learning that Otto intended to remain
there, probably as long as his antagonist’s
life was in danger, he said,—“Knight of
Trautwangen, if you entertain in reality
any friendly intentions towards me, then I
beseech you to take your departure this evening,
or, if it be possible, within this very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112"></span>hour. Even to look upon you, or hear your
voice, has become so intolerable, that, without
doubt, I must die if I am any longer subjected
to such torment.” In a mood of deep
melancholy, Otto then left the wounded Sir
Heerdegen, and rode away under the light of
the moon and stars, (which were then just
risen,) along a road fragrant with blooming
woods and flowers, which led towards the
town, Theobaldo bearing him company, and
riding by his side.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="c_09">CHAPTER IX.</h2></div>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto was entertained by the Merchant.
</p>


<p>The two horsemen, who thus proceeded on
their way, were indeed of tempers the most
opposite that could be imagined. As for
Otto, one might have said, that his whole
feelings were drawn from the darkest shades
of night that lay in the forest around them;
while Theobaldo’s, on the contrary, were
inspired and modified by the fragrance of
the blossoms, and the brightness of the stars.
The latter tried, by every means in his power,
to impart his own high spirits to his companion;
and when he found that such endeavours
were vain, began, in the melodious language
of his country, to sing one love-song
after another, which sounded beautifully amid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114"></span>the placid stillness of the night. Theobaldo
was a good musician, so that Otto’s meditations
were by no means disturbed by these
songs; for, as he could not understand the
words, it seemed to him almost as if one
of the numberless nightingales from the
neighbouring groves had determined to follow
him, and sing for him alone. He might
indeed interpret the language (or notes rather)
in any way that best suited the current of his
own emotions.</p>

<p>They came at last over a grassy eminence,
from which they beheld the large town of
Frankfort, with all its lights, on both sides of
the Mayne, outspread before them. Otto
halted there for a space, quite lost in wonder;
for, educated, as he had been, at a lonely castle
in the country, he had never before seen such
a town; and the great number of lighted
windows and lamps, though nothing more
than is visible every night, seemed to him like
some grand festal illumination. Theobaldo
amused himself for some time with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115"></span>surprise expressed by his companion, then said,
“Yes, Sir Otto, this is the far-famed free
town of Frankfort, and if you will enter
within its walls, and condescend to honour
my humble dwelling with your presence, I
shall perhaps be able to shew you scenes that
are yet more worthy of your approval and
admiration.”</p>

<p>Immediately thereafter, they rode past
several elegant villas and garden-houses on
the outside of the gates. For the most part
these dwellings made a brilliant appearance;
one heard the sounds of the harp, female
singers, and ringing of glasses; moreover,
the light came through handsome verandas,
bow-windows, and balconies, intertwined with
vines and jasmine, the sight of which added
effect to the sounds of convivial mirth within.
Sir Otto believed that he had already entered
the town, till at last, at Theobaldo’s command,
the massy wings of the gate were
opened, and they rode under the echoing
portico, as if into a great castle, to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116"></span>indeed Frankfort might be compared; and
if the citizens were proud (as Sir Hugh had
sometimes described them) the young knight
thought, when he came into the long lightedup
streets, that they had indeed good reason
to be so.</p>

<p>Just as Otto’s horse took fright at the
gleaming bow-windows of a large and handsome
building, Theobaldo said,—“Noble
sir, we are now arrived. Welcome to my
humble abode.” Immediately there hastened
from the palace many servants in elegant
dresses, who, on a signal from their master,
went to assist the knight; but he threw himself
lightly and carelessly from the saddle,
and as they were about to take his horse by
the reins, “Nay, good friends,” said he,
“that would prove no such easy undertaking;
for he will not suffer any attendance
but mine. I must myself lead him into the
stable, take off the saddle and bridle, and
give him his provender.” The glaring eyes
of the charger, and his unquiet pawing with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117"></span>his fore-hoof, bore witness to the truth of
what his rider had said. So the servants
lighted him to a stable, where there were already
many horses, which were all vehemently
startled by the entrance of the stranger
guest, stamping and neighing under the portico,
which Otto now brought among them.
He was indeed only withheld by his rider’s
serious commands from directly trying his
strength against some of his neighbours;
and when the servants busied themselves in
getting a halter to bind him fast, Otto
said to them,—“That alone would be of
little service, for he could easily break every
band; but if I bid him be quiet, he will obey
me.” Accordingly, he cried in a stern voice,—“Ruhig
Bursch!” whereupon the noble
animal stood like a lamb, and began to eat the
corn which his master shook out before him.</p>

<p>Thereafter Otto accompanied Theobaldo,
who had waited for him in the outer hall,
into the state-chambers above. Here, in
a lofty vaulted apartment, they found a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118"></span>numerous and brilliant assemblage, while at the
farther end of the room arrangements were
made for a kind of temporary theatre. The
floor was raised, and there appeared thereon,
in the back-ground, many figures in costly
dresses, who seemed about to play their parts
in some comedy. It was easy to perceive
that Theobaldo was the king of this festival;
for, of those who were least distinguished in
the company, all made room for him with
deep obeisance; while others, who were evidently
of high rank, ladies and gentlemen,
(the latter often with gold chains like senators,)
received as marks of special favour
his apologies, that he who was the master
of the feast should have arrived so late.
The performers in the back-ground of the
hall stood still, and were silent, waiting, as
it seemed, for their master’s signal, whether
they should proceed or give over, till Theobaldo,
having taken his place with his new
guest on a seat near the stage, kindly nodded
to them that the play should be continued.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119"></span></p>
<p>Their performance was a sort of allegorical
mystery, and the scene with which they were
then occupied exhibited a gorgeous figure
seated on a throne, representing the god of
wealth, with the name “Plutus” in gold letters
on his breast. Then there came all sorts
of characters, priests, courtiers, judges, poets,
minstrels, &amp;c., who paid their homage to
the god, entreating his protection. Thereupon
Plutus, from a great store of bags, supposed
to contain gold, gave more or less to
each applicant, and the gift was delivered
and received with some awkward rhymes, intending
to satirize all ranks. At length
there stepped forward a knight in complete
armour, who paid his court even more
humbly than the rest, and in a string of
verses, indicated that gold and silver were
the best balsam for wounds and bruises, concluding
with these rude lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Gold for blood, sir,—give enow;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Your battles shall be fought I trow!”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Plutus was ready to deliver his answer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120"></span>when, on hearing these last words, Otto started
up in great wrath, laid his hand vehemently
on his sword, and called out aloud, “That
base recreant disgraces the armour which he
wears, and I shall revenge on his own head
the falsehood which he has uttered, if he has
but courage to meet me on the field!”</p>

<p>Half laughing and half terrified, the whole
company fixed their attention on the young
angry champion. Theobaldo, however, who
was also incensed, put an end to the performance,
threatening the unfortunate representative
of knighthood, that he should never
again be suffered to enter within his doors.
He then turned courteously to Otto, and
begged that his guest would not impute the
blame to him, if those stupid players, because
they were in a merchant’s house, had absurdly
tried to gain favour by satirizing all other professions.
By this explanation the knight was
quite calmed, and on his part offered many
excuses for his rash conduct in thus disturbing
the company. Soon after, the whole party
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121"></span>adjourned to a magnificent banquet, which was
prepared for them in another apartment.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the brilliance of the
lights, the excellence of the viands, and profusion
of wine, Otto could not help reflecting
again on the hateful rhymes by which he
had been roused to that fit of anger. This
did not proceed, however, from any resentment
which he had conceived against his
courteous entertainer, nor against the company,
but he could not help feeling that it
was in consequence of his tragical encounter
with Sir Heerdegen that he had been
invited hither; and that he had as it were
received gold for blood; for whether his
reward were paid in the liquid gold of old
Johannisberg, or in solid metal, made, in
his estimation, no difference. Added to
this, the conversation did not please him.
He heard only endless debates about gain
and loss, principal and interest; and when
Theobaldo, sympathizing, as it seemed, with
his guest’s feelings, tried to turn the discourse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122"></span>to the crusades of King Richard, this only
led to a calculation, whether the Genoese or
the Venetians would gain most on that occasion.
Then, in the confusion of Otto’s
brain, it almost appeared as if the wine
that mantled in their cups were blood drawn
from the veins of Christian knights; that
the party knew this, and therefore drank
it with greater pleasure. Nay, it came over
him like a frightful dream, that Sir Heerdegen
of Lichtenried, with a hollow voice,
from his broken visor, addressed him:—“From
my heart’s blood thou now fill’st thy
luxurious cup, and while thou preparest for
thyself a rich bed of down, I am stretched on
the hard couch of pain, from whence, perchance,
I may never more arise!”</p>

<p>Otto could no longer bear this; all the
realities around him were lost in the creations
of his madness. So he quitted his seat, and
begged of Theobaldo that he might be allowed
to depart, as he must pass that night
at an auberge; for which resolution he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123"></span>tell him his reason on the following day. “I
do not require explanation,” answered Theobaldo,
“for I already know the cause of your
dissatisfaction. But, for Heaven’s sake, come
again to-morrow, otherwise I must think that
I too have become an object of your contempt!”
“On the honour and word of a knight,” said
Sir Otto, “I cherish for you only respect
and friendship, nor shall I fail to come to-morrow,
as you desire.” Thereupon they
embraced, and Otto, accompanied by one of
Theobaldo’s squires, led forth his horse, and
went to spend the night at a house of public
entertainment, to which he made his way
through the now dark streets, according to
directions that had been given to him.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="c_10">CHAPTER X.</h2></div>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto changed his armour, and the Merchant<br>
resolved to accompany him into the world.
</p>


<p>When Otto awoke, the morning light was
already beaming on his windows, and the confused
bustle of carriages and people in the
streets mingled strangely with his nightly
dreams. When he had shaken them off, he
dressed as quickly as possible, and ran to the
lattice; for he believed, from the noise, that
something extraordinary must have occurred.
In a short time, however, he became aware
that the disturbance, which appeared to him
so remarkable, was nothing more than what
must be caused by the daily goings-on of life
in a large town, of which no one took any
notice; or rather, it would have been a cause of
wonder and apprehension if the tumult had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125"></span>ceased. He bethought him also, that so many
large houses, most of which were equal in extent
to his father’s castle, must depend for their support
on a great number of inhabitants, among
whom there must exist many different feelings
and dispositions, pain and pleasure, falsehood
and sincerity, hatred and love, whence arose
the varied and discordant voices around him.
In the lonely fortress of Trautwangen, since
the date of its building, how much had been
suffered and enjoyed! But here in the town
many hundreds of forsaken Berthas might
weep, many wandering minstrels like Walter
tune their neglected harps, and many old
men like Sir Hugh mourn for the departure
of their beloved sons.</p>

<p>During these thoughts he was interrupted
by a servant of Theobaldo’s, who came, bearing
his armour and accoutrements, all brightly
polished, offering at the same time to assist
the knight in bracing them on. “You must
forgive me, noble sir,” said he, while Sir Otto
looked with satisfaction on his glittering mail,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126"></span>“if you should remark on the middle of the
cuirass, right over the heart, one spot; it
seems to be from blood which has lately
settled there; but, as it was neglected for
some hours, it has now turned into rust,
which, as long as the armour lasts, cannot be
effaced. But certainly, noble sir, this is not
my fault.” “No, good friend,” answered
Sir Otto; “it is, as thou sayst, no fault of
thine.” He thus repeated the squire’s words
in a slow mournful tone, fixing his eyes on
the cuirass; whereon he indeed perceived
plainly the blood of Sir Heerdegen of Lichtenried,
which must have dropped on him as
he was dressing his wounds. Henceforth he
could not bear the thoughts of wearing that
hauberk, and, instead of accepting the squire’s
services, sent him away with a complimentary
message to his master Theobaldo. “He had
already a servant who would assist in putting
on his armour, and who, though now absent,
would soon arrive.” But, when left alone, he
only walked up and down the room, and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127"></span>he came near the cuirass, started from it as if it
had been a spectre; or, when at last he forced
himself to touch it, he only tried every art,
which he had learned from his father and
other warriors, in order to efface the rust.
But the longer he laboured the more convinced
he became, that such efforts were
wholly in vain. “No!” said he, with a deep
sigh, “the stain will indeed remain there for
ever.” Then he strode up and down the
room, more vexed and melancholy than ever.</p>

<p>At length he overheard, in the next apartment,
loud expressions of discontent, and even
great wrath; then, fearful stamping on the
floor, and execrations. As the voice spoke
only of armour, greaves, corslet, and cuirass,
he soon learned that all this anger arose because
some one had got a coat of mail which
by no means fitted. Wishing to escape from
the conflict of his own feelings, Otto hastily
rose, and threw open the door, which led
into his neighbour’s room; whereupon a
knight, half cased in armour, stepped up to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"></span>him, and with equal impetuosity demanded
what he wanted. Both, however, stood silent
for a space, and gazing on each other; for
Otto directly recognised the former opponent
of Folko de Montfaucon, namely, the Count
Archimbald von Waldeck; while the latter
also seemed to remember the youthful witness
of that combat, and his overthrow. In a
short time they came to mutual explanations,
and Count Archimbald said, “I am not vain
enough to wish that you should keep me in
countenance, and also fall before the powerful
or fortunate arm of the French chevalier;
on the contrary, I should be heartily glad
if you could again recover, for the beautiful
Gabrielle, her favourite ring; and if, to say
the truth, there seems not much probability
of this, yet no one can tell what is in store for
him either of prosperous or evil fortune. You
have my sincere good wishes for your undertaking,
which may yet realize all your hopes.
For the present, observe, I pray you, how
the fates are tormenting me! In great wrath,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129"></span>at the events of that fatal evening, I had
rashly sworn that I would never again wear
my black and silver mail, with the eagle’s
head-piece; and, moreover, that I would ride
without armour, until I had even, thus defenceless,
won a complete suit as the prize
of a successful combat. In this undertaking
I have at last succeeded; but mark only how
pitiful must have been the limbs of my opponent!
I cannot force myself into the greaves
nor the armlets; the pigmy gloves are already
thrown out at the window, and as for the
corslet and cuirass, I have indeed drawn them
on, but, as you perceive, they will by no means
clasp together.” During these words, the
knight heaved and writhed as if he would
force the hauberk to expand, and in so doing,
tore asunder some of the plates with a loud
crash. Two squires who attended him drew
near to repair this misfortune, but he repulsed
them angrily. “It is all in vain,” said he,
“therefore give yourselves no farther trouble.
I have only to throw off these vile pigmy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130"></span>accoutrements, and for that purpose require no
assistance.” Thereupon he tore open the half-closed
buckles and straps, and took off the
corslet and cuirass, throwing them on the
ground with such violence, that the nails and
hooks started out upon the floor. He then
cast melancholy looks on his black and silver
armour, which lay in a corner, and which
Otto easily recognized by the eagle’s beak on
the visor. “When I wore these,” said he,
“I was yet a champion; now I am powerless,
and shall never again find a coat of
mail that will fit these limbs.” Otto had not
forgotten the horror with which he had just
before contemplated his own armour, and said,—“My
Lord Count, methinks we could now
easily help one another out of our distresses.
If you have sworn never to wear your harness,
I have in the next room a suit which I
would not willingly use again; and this for
reasons of which it is not fitting that I should
now speak farther than to assure you, that
they are not connected with shame or disgrace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131"></span>to the wearer.” “I should not expect any
less from you, young sir,” answered Sir Archimbald,
with a pleasant smile. “Well
then, let us make an exchange,” said Otto.
“Done, it is a bargain,” replied Sir Archimbald;
“I doubt not we shall be fitted; for
we are both framed like right old German
heroes.” The silver mail was immediately
brought into the room; and each being assisted
by a squire, they were soon equipt, standing,
as if transformed by magic, wondering at
each other. The now stern and wrathful
visage of Sir Archimbald contrasted strangely
with the mild light reflected on it by Otto’s
bright silver harness; while the youth’s blooming,
almost womanish features were surmounted
by the frightful helmet and visor in the
shape of an eagle’s head. At length they began
to stride, with thundering steps and threatening
gestures, through the room, to try how their
new accoutrements fitted; and both being
well satisfied, they shook hands, Archimbald
rejoicing in his heart that his black and silver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132"></span>mail, with the eagle’s head, would yet once
more come in the way of Sir Folko de Montfaucon.
“For,” said he, “you will at least
make him fight a hard battle, young knight of
Trautwangen! Of this I require no other
proof, than the hardness of your grasp even
now, and the noble warlike spirit which appears
in your whole demeanour.” They
now took leave of each other, like old and
tried friends. Archimbald, in order to mount
his horse, and Otto in order to fulfil his promise
to the young merchant.</p>

<p>The wealthy Theobaldo was now standing in
his great vaulted warehouse, with many clerks,
servants, and customers, around him, ruling
like a petty prince, even by signs and single
words, over all the business of the day, and
yet not disdaining to put his own hand to the
work in cases of necessity. Thus, on Otto’s
arrival, he was employed in measuring out
some pieces of very rich gold embroidered
cloth; on completing which, he perceived
the knight, without recognising him in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133"></span>black armour, for Otto had pulled down his
visor. Notwithstanding this, Theobaldo felt
attracted by him, like iron by the magnet;
for there was indeed a share of iron (if one
may so speak) in the courageous heart of the
merchant. “Have you any commands, noble
sir?” said he to the youth; “if so, please to
inform me, and you shall be served before all
other customers.” Hereupon Otto threw open
his visor, and the merchant started back
with astonishment and admiration. “Good
Heaven!” cried he, “how much nobler and
more dignified are your looks now than even
yesterday! and must I thus appear before
you with the pitiful measuring rod in my
hand?” Therewith he threw away the despised
implement with such force, that it struck
against a pillar, and broke into a hundred
pieces, though as it was made of ivory and
gold; the attendants thought it could never
have been their master’s design to destroy it in
such manner. They therefore ran and picked
up the fragments, anxiously informing him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134"></span>that it would be very possible to have it
again repaired, and made as good as ever.
The merchant, however, took no notice of
these words, but hastily led the knight up
stairs into his house.</p>

<p>On their entrance into a retired and richly
furnished chamber, Theobaldo took his guest
by both hands, bent over them with a deep
blush of anxiety and ardour on his countenance,
and said,—“For Heaven’s sake, Sir
Otto von Trautwangen, refuse not the earnest
entreaty which I am now about to make
to you. Allow me also to wear armour,
and as your friend, your servant and squire,
or in any way that you are pleased to appoint,
to go with you into the world, and share in
all your dangers.” Otto looked at him with
wonder, then reminded him of his rich merchandize,
his brilliant and luxurious house,
insisting that his stars had destined him to
play a very different part in the world from
that of a knight-errant. “Say not so,” answered
the merchant vehemently. “I am by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135"></span>birth a Milanese, and it has been proved
already on the shields of German warriors,
even against the attacks of emperors, that our
citizens are not ignorant of warfare. There
survives yet somewhat of the old Roman
spirit among us. Besides, you must not judge
the party at our last night’s banquet by their
conversation alone. You perceived too, that
I was dissatisfied and wearied therewith,
though more for your sake than my own,
because I perceived that you misunderstood
them, and was offended.” “Nay,” answered
Sir Otto, “I took no offence; but, as so
much was said of gain and loss, of goods and
prices, it appeared to my disordered fantasy
as if the festivous entertainment which I then
enjoyed, and the night’s lodging which had
been promised me, were also like goods which
I had purchased with the blood of the unfortunate
Sir Heerdegen. Thus I was obliged
to retire. I give you this explanation the
more freely, because I have now recovered
from the wild dreams by which I was then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136"></span>haunted, and against you and your friends
have not one word of just complaint.” “You
are in the right,” answered Theobaldo; “the
various characters of mankind in this world
may indeed be compared to the varied flowers,
plants, and trees of the forest, which all differ
from each other, and yet all contribute to one
purpose. Their conversation no doubt differs
from yours, even as their dresses contrast
with your glittering armour; yet, in time of
need, they are not found destitute of honour,
generosity, and courage. You are in the
right, therefore, not to despise these merchant
citizens, although I for my part have
resolved to desert them and try my fortune
with you.” “Nay, dear Theobaldo,” replied
Sir Otto, “allow me to dissuade you from this
design. You are older, and have far more experience
and judgment than I am possessed of.
How then can I become your leader and instructor,
or by what means could I compensate
to you the loss of all those advantages which
you enjoy here?” “Well,” answered Theobaldo,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137"></span>“if, as you say, I have more experience
and judgment, you may with the less
hesitation allow to me my own free choice in
this matter.” “Besides,” resumed Sir Otto,
“from the friendship I bear to you, I should
be deeply grieved if you meet with any
injury. But how can that be avoided, since
you have probably never yet been accustomed
to the use of the sword or lance?”
Theobaldo looked at him with a good-humoured
half-ironical smile, then turned
round, and opened the door into a neighbouring
cabinet, wherein was visible a great
collection of shirts of mail, helmets, crossbows,
targets, and battle-axes. “These are
but the accoutrements of simple horsemen,
not of knights,” said Theobaldo; “but such
weapons I am well able to wield and use to
good purpose.” Thereupon he took from the
wall a handsome cross-bow, bent it with great
skill and strength, and laid an arrow in the rest;
then, opening the window, “Mark,” said he,
“the knotted branch in yonder oak-tree!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138"></span>Scarcely allowing himself a moment to take
aim, he sent his arrow with such force and
unerring accuracy, that it not only struck the
branch, but penetrated so far into the tree,
that only the trembling feathers were now
visible. Thereafter Theobaldo took up a
heavy battle-axe, and exercised himself with
it against a strong shirt of mail, exhibiting
such power and rapidity of arm, that Otto
could not help expressing his admiration.
“Are you now willing that I should go with
you?” said the merchant, with a confident
smile. “Ay, truly,” answered the knight;
“and from my heart I can affirm, that you are
well able to maintain, by your deeds as a soldier,
all that you have before alleged in
words. Where in all the world could I find
a better companion? But, alas! Theobaldo,
since you are not of knightly birth, how can
we venture to speak of your wearing golden
spurs? and if you are never to become a
knight, why should you needlessly subject
yourself to the humiliation of being a squire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139"></span>to such a humble unpractised warrior as I
am?” At these words, a dark shade passed
for a moment over Theobaldo’s countenance;
but he answered firmly,—“Let us speak no
farther of the difference of ranks. I wear
arms, ride a good horse, and am content to
follow you. Young men of knightly birth
strive for golden spurs. Young citizens
aim but at the wreath of victory. When in
your society I have obtained skill and experience
in warfare, I may yet lead on the
banners of my native city, Milan, to the
battle-field, and then golden spurs will be
forgotten!” “I had no thought of offending
you,” said Otto, somewhat surprised;
but immediately thereafter the dark shade
passed away from Theobaldo’s features, and
his looks were again gay and smiling as the
vernal sky that shone above them. He now
accompanied the knight to a luxurious breakfast,
which was prepared in the banquet-hall.
Indeed the whole day was spent in feasting
and music; though as the merchant was often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140"></span>called away on matters of importance, on
which he seemed to bestow great attention,
Otto began almost to believe, that, as to
his riding out like a knight-errant, he had
only been in jest. Yet at night, when Theobaldo
led him to his apartment (for he had
been obliged to promise that he would pass
the night there) he found that this apprehension
was groundless. “To-morrow before
sunrise,” said the merchant, “Sir Knight
of Trautwangen, forget not that I shall be
ready to attend you. I have already appointed
a trust-worthy curator over my possessions
in this town, and made every needful
arrangement.”</p>

<p>In the morning, before daylight, Sir Otto
was in the stable, engaged in saddling and
bridling his charger; in which task he was
assisted by an active youth in a complete
horseman’s armour. As they did not speak,
it was not until the latter came out into the
morning twilight, and sprung lightly on the
back of a chesnut-coloured Polish horse, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141"></span>the knight recognised Theobaldo. Smiling
on each other, they shook hands like old and
tried friends, then trotted on merrily to the
town-gates, while the sun, bright and jocund,
as if to welcome the two happy youths, began
to shed his long slanting radiance over
the landscape.</p>

How Sir Heerdegen returned to the Castle of Trautwangen,<br>
and of the wonderful Lady Minnatrost.
</p>


<p>Thus Otto and his companion continued to
pursue their way, crossing ere long the
frontiers of the knight’s father-land, and
meeting with various adventures in the
kingdom of France, among people to
whose language they were yet little accustomed.
Meanwhile, how different was
the life now led by the inhabitants left in
the old castle of Trautwangen! A third
party had indeed broken on the lonely hours
of Sir Hugh and the forsaken Bertha, but
his presence only made the scene more
gloomy than ever. This was Sir Heerdegen
of Lichtenried, who, notwithstanding his
wounds, had hastened onwards to visit his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143"></span>sister, and by this untimely exertion, had
brought on himself a fearful illness. In a
chamber not far from the great hall was
placed the couch of the unfortunate Sir
Heerdegen, in order that Bertha might attend
him, and yet be near to the old knight.
It was indeed needful that he and Bertha
should console each other; for in the delirium
of his fever, the youth had unfortunately
betrayed all which he would in health have
so gladly concealed; they had learned from
whose hands, and on what grounds, he had
received his dangerous wounds. Thereafter,
Bertha often wept so bitterly, and blushed
so deeply, that her tears might be compared
to the morning dew, brightened by the red
gleams of the east. On the other hand, Sir
Hugh fixed his eyes on the ground in gloomy
meditation, drawing, from this first unhappy
combat of his son, the darkest anticipations
of the future. Now and then, however, his
confidence in the goodness and mercy of Providence
would return, and a smile would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144"></span>steal over his features, though he spoke no
words by which the by-standers could have
guessed at this change in his feelings; only
he repeated sometimes that rhyme of the
old minstrel, which Otto had remembered
during the mysterious night, when he watched
his armour in the chapel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Dark night precedes the morn,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">So grief may joyance bring,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And death leads through the wintry grave</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To life’s eternal spring.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Hugh dared not enter the apartment of
his nephew; for the latter, in the wildness of
his delirium, always addressed the old man as
if he had been Otto von Trautwangen, commanding
him in a stern angry voice to leave
the room, otherwise he would throw at his
head all the scorching firebrands that were
now heaped upon his own. At such times he
indeed grappled violently at the bandage
which was tied over his wounds; and his
uncle, with mournful aspect, and sighing
deeply, came back to the hall, passing by that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145"></span>heavy oak-pannelled door, at which, alas! the
blooming happy countenances of Bertha and
Otto never more presented themselves. However,
when the wounded youth had only his
beloved sister beside him, especially in the
night hours, when the room was illuminated
by a single lamp placed in a corner, he was
tranquil and happy, so that, now and then, he
could even tell her long stories; among which
she once heard from him the narrative which
here follows:—</p>

<p>“On the shores of the North Sea there lies
a country named East Friesland, where, even
at this day, there are endless dissensions between
the princes and their vassals; the former
insisting that every one should blindly
submit to their sovereign will and pleasure,
while the latter no less vehemently maintain,
that their opinions should be consulted on all
subjects. Thus, through the whole land,
there are constant insurrections and tumults,
even like those, dear Bertha, which now torment
the brain of your wounded brother.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"></span>Yet in East Friesland there is a wondrous
castle stationed on a rock, whence there
beams, far and wide, a pale tranquil light,
the reflection as it were of the moon and
stars, whose radiance falls ever brightly
and unbroken on these lofty towers. In
the castle dwells a female descendant of
that ancient race named the Druden. They
were powerful wizards and magicians; and
such too is this female descendant with
whom we claim relationship; for she is our
aunt. Her name is the Lady Minnatrost,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1">[1]</a> importing,
that by love she affords consolation to
unfortunate lovers; and all day long she
boils wonder-working flowers and roots in a
kettle, which is made of pure gold. I had one
evening lost my way, and drew up my horse’s
reins when opposite to her lofty castle, which
proudly diffuses its light over all that country,
which is elsewhere flat and level. Tired as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147"></span>then was, and in need of refreshment, I felt
as if some mysterious obstacle always lay in
my road when I wished to spur my horse up
the steep acclivity. The castle too was so
silent, and so wholly unknown to me, that I
felt an unwonted dread of approaching it.
Thus, while I stood still, and doubted what
course I ought to take, lo! there came riding
at a rapid pace, along the plain, a well-accoutred
knight, bearing in his arms a slender
female form, who clung to him at once,
lovingly and timidly. As they passed by
I heard her sing,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Spur, spur thy steed, Sir Frederick dear,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The silent Druda’s towers are near;”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>to which the knight answered,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“What need of Druda, dearest life?</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Already we are man and wife.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>“Just as these rhymes were uttered, there
sprung out from among the thickets a number
of armed men, who, as I perceived by their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148"></span>dresses, were of low rank. A tall powerful youth
rushed up, and, seizing the knight’s horse
by the reins, called aloud, ‘Villain, villain,
whither art thou bearing my sister,’—the rest,
meanwhile wielding great halberts, and other
weapons, made a circle round the lovers. The
knight, however, on the first attack, had drawn
his sword, and now said, ‘Not so fast, base
churl! She loves me, and I love her. What
business is it of thine, if thy chief is pleased
to demand thy sister? Knows’t thou not that
I am Sir Frederick von Edekon?’ ‘In a few
seconds more thou shalt be but his ghost,’
answered the youth, ‘if thou dost not instantly
give back this maiden to her family.’
Thereupon the knight struck him a blow
with his sword, and a furious battle commenced.
As I perceived very well that the
maiden wished to remain with her lover, I
assisted him, and attacked the countrymen
in a manner which they had little expected.
Notwithstanding their courageous resistance,
the victory would soon have been ours; but,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149"></span>in the midst of our conflict, Heaven knows
how it could happen, but we all heard the
sound of a lattice opened in the castle that
stood above us, and, for reasons inscrutable,
found ourselves irresistibly impelled to pause
in our encounter, and look upwards for
whatever should present itself at the window.
Then, behold, the full moon shone
calm and bright on the lattice, and we all
saw the figure of the Lady Minnatrost,
tall in stature, clad in a white garment, and
with her right hand held up threateningly
towards the stars. At this apparition a cold
shuddering vibrated through our frames.
We remained for a long while silent and
motionless, till at length she spoke, ‘Lift
not again your swords in vain and impious
contention! I know that there is one among
you who is my nephew, and is named Heerdegen
von Lichtenried. He is here a stranger,
but, nevertheless, he shall place that maiden
before him on his horse, and shall bring her
to me in my castle. The rest shall go peaceably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150"></span>home for this night; but in three days
let her bridegroom and brother come also to
me.’ All was done as she had commanded.
Though the maiden wept bitterly, though
the knight and her brother gnashed their
teeth with rage, yet no one felt inclined to
pass a night under the roof of that ghastly
white-robed Druda! But it seemed as if her
will were now irresistible, and every one must
submit in silence. Without saying a word,
therefore, the combatants laid down their
swords, and, in the same mood of humble
obedience, I brought the maiden to the
castle.</p>

<p>“What I found there, dearest Bertha, I am
not able to describe in many words, and truly,
where all is strange and supernatural, words
fail to afford any adequate impression. But
look on those pale rays of your nightly lamp
that now flicker around us; look at your own
pale and saint-like face in the mirror, and even
here you may behold a gleam,—the tenderest
and loveliest,—of that light which was shed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151"></span>all about the castle of the Lady Minnatrost.
I durst not enter her habitation; she commanded
me to wait under the portico. ‘It
will not be unpleasant to you,’ said she, ‘to
pass the night here, half sheltered, half in the
open air. There are no tempests to annoy
you, and if rain falls, it is but a mild dew
from heaven, which refreshes without injuring
the limberest flowers. Such too will
be your tears,’ added she, turning to the
maiden, ‘and, after transient showers, the
sunrise of joy will be brighter and lovelier.’
In truth, I perceived that the damsel immediately
ceased to weep, after she had looked
on the calm, thoughtful features of the
Druda, illumined as they now were by the
moonshine. Both then retired into the castle,
and soon thereafter I heard a delightful
harmony of harps and flutes sounding from
its chambers. The music was slow, soft, and
of exquisite modulation, fitted, as I could well
imagine, to lull the unhappy maiden to forgetfulness
and sleep. Thereafter the Lady
Minnatrost came to me in the portico, bringing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152"></span>with her a golden goblet filled with wine,
also a massive salver with exquisite viands.
She took her place near me, and related how
she was our mother’s sister, and how for
many years there had belonged to her family
a store of deep and miraculous knowledge,
whose mysteries were yet all sanctioned
by our holy religion; finally, how she believed
herself to have been chosen to reside
here for the guidance and instruction of a
wild disorderly people. These stories were
long and marvellous, lasting, indeed, through
the whole of that moonlight night. Sometimes
I listened with a kind of mysterious
dread, but for the most part my feelings
were calm and tranquil, so that I could almost
think that I was once more a child, that
my mother rocked me in her arms, and told
me fairy tales as she had done of yore. Towards
the dawn of day the Druda left me,
saying, ‘Thou wilt probably remain here,
in order to learn how these adventures will
end, and may stay without fear of any
danger.’ Thereafter I fell asleep calmly, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153"></span>if I had been under the protection of a
mother’s roof.</p>

<p>“On the following day, I perceived now and
then the Lady Minnatrost walking with that
lovelorn damsel on the castle ramparts,
among tall white flowers that grew there,
and from whose blossoms, as they waved in
the morning air, there exhaled the sweetest
odours. Often, however, the maiden wept
bitterly, and called aloud for Sir Frederick
von Edekon. At such time the Druda spoke
not; she offered neither consolations nor promises,
but only fixed on the weeping girl her
thoughtful eyes, whose light was always mild
and soothing as the moonbeams, or broke off
a blooming sprig from the white flowers that
grew there, and with it fanned her burning
cheeks. At last too she sung old simple
ballads, till the listener was calmed, and even
smiled with wondrous cheerfulness. Such
too was the conduct of the white-robed
lady every time when the damsel’s brother
and the knight appeared, and with threatening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154"></span>looks and angry words demanded
her release. The Druda only smiled, and
looked on them in silence; whereupon their
angry words died away on their lips like a
mournful sigh, or changed into humble and
patient entreaties. After they had thus come
three times, they were on the ninth day all
become mild, submissive, and pious. Then
the Lady Minnatrost gave them back the now
smiling damsel, who soon afterwards was led
to the altar, in peace and unanimity, betwixt
her brother and the knight. Thereafter they
all lived happily together; nor were there
ever dissensions any more betwixt that chief
and his vassals.</p>

<p>“Many other stories are told in that neighbourhood
of the consolation which the wonderful
lady of the castle has afforded to those
in distress, especially to victims of unfortunate
love; so that she well deserves the name that
is bestowed on her, since her aid has always
been afforded in the spirit of love and charity,
not in that of violence or constraint.”</p>

<p class="center">
How the Lady Bertha went with her brother in quest of the<br>
Lady Minnatrost.
</p>

<p>By degrees, as the knight spoke thus with
his sister, and told her more and more stories
of that wonderful lady, his own feelings, both
of mind and body, became soothed and tranquil.
He no longer raved in feverish delirium,
but asked calmly for his uncle; and
when Sir Hugh came into his apartment,
spoke respectfully and kindly, entreating forgiveness,
if his words before had been wild
and unbecoming. The old knight, therefore,
often sat by his couch, but this was not long
needful; for scarcely had the wounded youth
begun to obtain a victory over his illness, ere
he went gaily forth into the fields and forests
to enjoy the sports of the chase, and sat with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156"></span>Sir Hugh at the mid-day and evening banquet,
over full mantling goblets of old Hungarian
or Johannisberg.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bertha, whilst her brother
thus recovered his strength and spirits,
became every day more and more pale and
melancholy. It was easy to perceive, that
only her anxiety for Sir Heerdegen’s life, and
her wish to comfort the old knight, had
before prevented her from falling into this
mood of sadness. Now, however, the two
warriors sat together over their full brimming
wine-cups, enlivened often by the old minstrel
Walter, who came to entertain them with
his heroic ballads. Bertha meanwhile was left
amid the woods and meadows, like a poor
lonely flower, wearing out her life with
melancholy dreams, mournful songs, and deep-drawn
sighs, amid the solitude of nature.
Truly she would soon have faded quite away,
even like the fair Lisberta, or like the hermit
of the Finland frontiers, only that her brother
also knew these stories, and told them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157"></span>Bertha; so that she knew there had been
others in the world who had sufferings like
her own. Yet she clung to him always with
most confidence when he spoke to her of
the Lady Minnatrost, and was in heart
rejoiced to think that this pious Druda had
not been merely a phantom raised by the
feverish dreams of her brother, but that
in East Friesland there really lived a heroine
of that name, who was also her near relation.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all this, she became
always paler and more absorbed in her own
meditations, so that she scarcely ever spoke;
and when Sir Heerdegen questioned her,
she used to answer, “Alas! dear brother, it
will never be my lot to see in this life the wonderful
lady, of whose love and charity you
have said so much. But beyond the grave
are the realms and habitations of love, and it
is time methinks, that death, like a gentle
sleep, should close up this world from my
senses, that I might awake in that sanctuary.”</p>

<p>These and other words of the same tenour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158"></span>were faithfully repeated to Sir Hugh by the
Knight of Lichtenried, who added hereto, that
if Bertha were not soon conducted to the castle
of the Lady Minnatrost, she would in a few
months be departed to join her loving ancestors
in heaven. Sir Hugh then summoned
up all his resolution, directed that his niece
should be brought before him, and in a
solemn voice ordered that in a few days she
should be prepared to go with her brother to
the distant land of East Friesland, where was
situated the castle of her aunt, named the
Lady Minnatrost. Bertha looked doubtfully
and mournfully at the old man, whose heart
had already been so grieved by the departure
of his son. Thereupon Sir Hugh laughed
aloud; “The foolish little bird thinks, perhaps,
that such an old ruined tower must
fall to pieces if she no longer flutters around
it!” He laughed again, went into another
chamber, and shut the door; but when alone
the old knight wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Afterwards, however, he ordered speedy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159"></span>preparations to be made for their departure;
so that, on the morning of the second day, a
palfrey, with a packhorse, the war-steed of Sir
Heerdegen, and four squires, were ready in the
castle-court. Sir Hugh came down the wide
staircase with the brother and sister, humming
all the way an old song, remembered from the
days of his youth. He embraced them ere
they mounted, then forced them to ride away;
and thereafter went with the minstrel Walter
to the rampart, seated himself silently on the
grass, and gazed at the travellers as they
proceeded always farther and farther along
the plains, now bright with the dews and
ruddy sun-gleams of the morning. Thereupon
the minstrel called to mind how he had
before sat there with Bertha in the same
place, when the young Sir Otto was spurring
his light-brown charger across the meadow;
and, without reflection, led on by natural associations,
he began once more the first
verses of the song which he had chaunted on
that occasion. The words were as follows:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160"></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“A weak old man am I,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">No longer dare I roam!”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the venerable knight, in great wrath,
seized hold of him by the arm, and shook
him heartily. In a thundering voice too,
like the roaring of a lion, he called out,—“Would’st
thou mock me, then? I shall
hurl thee down from the rampart into the
valley beneath, unless thou confessest that
the old grey-haired warrior hath yet strength
in his limbs and courage in his heart!” The
minstrel was with these words dragged to
the very edge of the rampart; but, without
changing colour or countenance, he
looked the knight firmly in the face, saying,—“If
it be your pleasure to attack an
old man, who is no warrior, but a minstrel,
and at the same time your guest, do so in
God’s name. That is your affair, not mine,
and the whole adventure may soon be ended!”
Thereupon Sir Hugh trembled vehemently,
and let him go. “For Heaven’s sake forgive
me!” said he; “you know that evil spirits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161"></span>have formerly exercised their power over me
in this life; and now, when my solitary penance
was begun, methought that a strange man
had come hither to sing ballads, mocking me
in the impotence of mine old age. It was the
strange man that I wished to fling over the
rampart.” “That was forsooth a proper
mode of proving your penitence,” said the
minstrel. Sir Hugh was for some moments
silent and ashamed;—at length he said,—“I
know not, Master Walter, if I can invite
you any more to join me over a goblet of
wine in the castle.” “Wherefore should you
not?” answered the old poet; “we minstrels
were indeed unworthy of protection and
patronage, if we knew not how to bear with
the varying humours of irritable and yet noble
minds.” Thereupon he followed his venerable
host into the fortress.</p>

<p class="center">
How the Lady Bertha was received in the Druda’s castle.
</p>

<p>Heerdegen and Bertha had now travelled
for many days, and the nearer they approached
towards the shores of the North Sea,
the damsel was the more cheerful, and the
youth more discontented. When Bertha
questioned him why he was thus vexed, he
answered,—“It seems to me almost as if I
were now leading you into the cloister; for if
that wonderful lady has you once within her
walls, Heaven knows whether she will ever
allow you to come again among mankind; nor
indeed, so far as I can judge by your own disposition,
will you ever wish again to leave that
silent castle, with its flowers on the rampart,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163"></span>and its moonlight radiance!” “Well, dear
brother,” answered the damsel, “that would
only be the fulfilment of my own desires,
which, doubtless, you would not prevent.”
“It were a loss to the world,” answered
Heerdegen; “and I had gladly seen you led
to the altar.” “Nay,” said Bertha, “we shall
doubtless find at the pious lady’s castle all
that is fitting for religious duties, a chapel, a
cross, and an altar.” “It was not thus,”
said Heerdegen, “that I wished to be understood;”
then looked discontentedly at his
horse’s feet, while Bertha turned away,
blushing, and gazing at the long grass and
flowers that grew around them.</p>

<p>After such discourse, she thought to render
her brother more tranquil, by praising
the beauty of the land through which they
now past, the green grassy hills, winding
streams, and verdant woods. To which he
answered,—“In the bright days of midsummer
all this is indeed pleasant and delightful;
but let the winter once come on, with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164"></span>howling winds and deep snows, while the
lonely habitations of the poor inhabitants send
up their smoke amid the pathless wilderness,
more like funeral piles than pleasant
dwellings, then you would cease to praise the
country which you now so much admire.”
“But at the castle of the Lady Minnatrost
there are neither snow-storms nor howling
winds,” said Bertha. Whereupon Heerdegen
peevishly answered,—“Ay, ay, so it has
been said. I myself have never been there in
the winter!” Then he rode on in silence; and
the more gloomy he appeared, the more earnestly
did Bertha long to be with her wonderful
aunt, who might, by her magic spells,
restore the knight to serenity.</p>

<p>One day Sir Heerdegen seemed more than
ever lost in deep reflection, from which
Bertha concluded that they were now near
the end of their journey. Her heart heaved
and beat with her own visionary expectations,
while towards evening her brother, almost
with terror in his aspect, looked round for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165"></span>some house of entertainment for travellers;
but nothing was visible but some lonely moss-covered
cottages. He sent out both their
attendants to explore in different directions;
and as, after having stood still for some time,
he found that they did not return, he ordered
those who had charge of the packhorse to
wait there while he rode about with Bertha.
But in the winding paths of the wooded
country they soon lost their way altogether,
found no fitting house to rest in for the night,
nor could they even make their way back to
the spot where he had desired the servants to
wait for him. The stars were now shining
bright in heaven, and Sir Heerdegen suddenly
halted as they came to the foot of a steep
ascent. “Good Heavens!” cried he, “if I
mistake not, we are come earlier to our journey’s
end than I had expected or wished.
How gladly, dearest Bertha, would I have
still had you with me till the morning! Look
up towards the summit of the hill, and try
whether by star-light you can distinguish a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166"></span>fortress.” At that moment the full moon, that
was now rising, broke forth in refulgence from
the east, and immediately the windows of the
castle were illuminated in glittering radiance;
crosses too were seen gleaming on the towers
and ramparts; soft music came floating from
afar, through the woods, gently waved by the
night wind. Bertha stretched out her arms
towards the light, with looks of triumph and
rejoicing, while her brother struck his cuirass
with his iron-gloved right hand, heaving a
sigh of doubt and apprehension.</p>

<p>Then, among the stems of some tall birch-trees,
they saw approaching them a female
form, tall and white, even like the trees,
and with a green veil over her head and
shoulders. Bertha thought this must be the
Lady Minnatrost; and when the veil was
thrown back, and she beheld the mild gleam
of her tranquil eyes, in which shone the spirit
of innocence and peace, the damsel alighted
from her palfrey, and sunk down, kneeling on
the grass before the Druda. Sir Heerdegen too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167"></span>forgot all his doubts and discontent. He
dismounted, bowed respectfully, and wished
to speak of Bertha’s visit, but the lady said,—“It
is enough, all is already known to me;
therefore I came to meet the guests that were
to me so heartily welcome. This time you
also, Sir Heerdegen, shall go with us to the
castle.” Thereupon she gave a hand to each,
placing herself between them to lead them up
the mountain, chaunting all the way a song
of which the silvery tones alone, even without
words, were enough to inspire peace and
happiness in the heart of every listener.
They arrived in no long time at the fortress,
where Sir Heerdegen kindly, and without expressing
any low spirits or displeasure, took
leave of his sister. It seemed as if he had
never, during his whole life, known difficulties,
or been roused to anger. They conversed
all three kindly and confidentially with
each other, appointing certain days on which
he was to come to the castle, in order to visit
Bertha. Then he walked (courteously kissing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168"></span>his iron glove and waving his helmet) down
the mountain, while Bertha went with the
smiling Lady Minnatrost into the mansion.</p>

<p>The gate opened, and then closed immediately
behind them; whereupon Bertha perceived
with surprise, that they had to cross a
small lake of the purest water, wherein the
moon and stars were reflected in all their loveliness.
A bark came, self-impelled, floating
towards them, in which they took their places,
and were gently ferried across. Bertha perceived
immediately, on the ramparts and
towers, the waving and fragrance of the tall
white flowers of which her brother had spoken
with her when he lay on his sick-bed. Now
she understood for the first time the full force
of his descriptions, when she was sailing on
the tranquil waters of that lake, with the
odours of those white flowers bathing her temples
and floating around her. From the
building within came the sound of harps and
cymbals, as if in friendly salutation; and when
the two voyagers had disembarked, and begun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169"></span>to walk through the long vaulted halls, those
pleasant sounds became always louder and
more articulate. Every room was illuminated,
but with a mild pensive light; for it was from
the reflection of the full moon, by mirrors so
contrived, that her rays were multiplied and
cast without shadow on every object. At last,
entering into a great hall with Gothic arches,
Bertha perceived whence had arisen that
music with which her senses had before been
refreshed and delighted. This apartment
was filled with wonderful mechanism, such as
no artisan could imitate. Golden rings,
self-moved, turned round their endless circles,
and as they touched each other, produced
the most exquisite melody. These rings
also set in motion the cymbals, and awoke
the harp-strings, which were stretched, like
a magical net-work, between the pillars.
Bertha was now able to imagine how that
damsel must have been soothed into refreshing
sleep, as her brother had described;
she too, having seated herself on a soft couch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"></span>soon lost herself in pleasant dreams; from
which, if at times she half awoke, she beheld
and heard those magic rings circling around
her, and the tranquil eyes, with their moonlike
radiance, of the watchful Druda.</p>

How the Lady Bertha was left alone in the Druda’s castle.
</p>


<p>Henceforward Bertha’s life in the castle
was spent as if in the threshold between two
worlds, one while occupied with childish
plays, and at another with gleams of higher
wisdom, derived from sources mysterious and
far remote. As her brother rode up now
and then to the gates, she spoke with him
from the ramparts, told him of all the wonders
that she had beheld, and how happily
she now lived. He, on the other hand,
rejoiced, that her cheeks wore the rose of
health, contrasting with the white flowers by
which she was there surrounded; and so they
always parted from each other in hope and
confidence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172"></span></p>
<p>Among other amusements, Bertha was
especially delighted with a certain mirror,
which, surrounded by strange talismanic
characters, was placed against the wall of a
retired chamber. When the Druda, for the
first time, withdrew the dark red curtain by
which it was covered, she said to the damsel,—“There,
child, divert yourself for a space
with the varied imagery which you will behold
in that glass. For the present I have
serious duties to perform.” Bertha then
stood alone before the mirror, trembling and
doubtful what she was to expect to see there;
but in a few minutes a new world seemed
starting into life within its sphere; landscapes,
men and women, towns and castles.
At one time the scene presented a wide
sea, on which ships were sailing for purposes
of merchandise or warfare, now under
a bright smiling sky, now amid storms and
dark thunder-clouds. Then she beheld long
church aisles full of people assembled in
prayer, or great squares of a city, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173"></span>enclosed lists, and knights engaged in desperate
encounters. These last Bertha was unwilling
to look upon; for they forced her to reflect
on the combat between the Chevalier de
Montfaucon and Count Archimbald von
Waldeck, whence arose all her sufferings.
Again, however, the mirror changed the
scene to the interior of a magnificent castle,
where a great king was seated on a throne,
and around him were many knights and ladies.
Then there were visible Moorish towns, with
their strangely-attired inhabitants, in long
dresses, on the streets. Of all the pictures,
however, that by which Bertha was most interested
was a wild rocky country, answering to
the descriptions which she had oftentimes
heard of Norway and Sweden. On one of the
highest cliffs, there was an old moss-grown
watch-tower, from which, through a single
window, there gleamed a steady light, pale
indeed, like departing moonshine; and on this
object the damsel could have gazed for hours
together, believing, that in that lonely abode
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174"></span>she might yet find consolation for all her
misfortunes. These thoughts she often described
to the Lady Minnatrost, who answered
her,—“That solitary watch-tower, by which
your attention has been thus attracted, lies
far remote in the cold climate of the north.
I must very soon make a journey thither;
but, alas! you cannot go with me!” Such
discourse only made those northern realms to
the damsel more and more interesting; and
never was she so calm and contented in spirit,
as when the rocky landscape with the pale
beacon-light came before her in the mirror.</p>

<p>Late one evening the friendly Druda came
out with Bertha on one of the lofty watch-towers
of the castle, where over their heads
was only the clear azure of heaven, and
the night air was filled with fragrance from
the snow-white flowers. The Druda then
fixed her eyes on the starry sky; and, by her
looks and gestures, it seemed to the damsel
as if her mysterious companion not only saw
the stars, but listened to exquisite melody.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175"></span>At last Bertha broke the long pause, and
said,—“Dearest lady, you listen watchfully,
as if you heard the circling gold rings in
your great hall, and yet all is silent!” “Do
I not hear them?” said the Druda, with a
smile of rapture. “To you, indeed, my
dear child, all is silent. But even as the
golden circles sometimes revolve in the
hall beneath, so in the beaming boundless
chambers of heaven are ever moving those
blessed spheres which we call the stars, and
sound so beauteously, that all other music
compared with them is discord, even were it
the loveliest that has ever been heard on
earth. Only the chosen votary whose heart
and feelings are in unison with those sounds
may hear them; others must be content to
believe and wonder; or sometimes, for a transient
space, they are visited by such melody
in their dreams.”</p>

<p>The damsel now looked at her aunt with a
fixed and anxious gaze; for she had of late
felt more desire to learn the mysterious arts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176"></span>of which she had heard so much, than of that
awe with which they had before inspired her.
She was therefore now ready to beg that the
Lady Minnatrost would initiate her in the
true science of those wonders by which she
was surrounded. Perceiving her design,
however, the lady cast on her a look, at which
she recoiled and trembled. “Foolish child,”
said she, in a severe tone; “of what art thou
now dreaming? Think’st thou that, because
these mysteries have contributed to thy entertainment,
they are in truth no more than
a game which the young and unexperienced
may play at? The chosen votary, on whom
such gifts are conferred by Providence, must
bear with her lot as she best can, for such
knowledge is often a cause of fearful sufferings.
Think’st thou, that I have always
lived in this castle? that I have always been
thus lonely, and never borne my share in the
pleasures of the world? Alas! it is far otherwise.
I once led a happy life among my fellow-mortals;
but the science conferred on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177"></span>me disturbed my peace, though that was indeed
no fault of mine. Now I am called
Minnatrost, and truly, as the name imports, I
have consolation for the grief of others; but,
alas! none for my own sorrows.” Thereupon
the lady began to weep, and, as if wearied,
leaned her head on the damsel’s bosom, whose
heart was deeply moved; for she had before
only seen her wonderful aunt in the mood of
cheerfulness and serenity. Now she discovered
that the Druda had experienced,
like others, her share of joy and suffering in
this world; she embraced her fervently, and
weeping also, said,—“Dearest aunt, how
unspeakably I love you!” The Lady Minnatrost,
however, soon resumed her composure.
“If thou indeed lovest me so dearly,” said
she, in a kind though solemn tone, “this
must be proved by thy care, that for the
future we may live together. I must now
make a long journey, even as far as to that
old watch-tower in Sweden, which has afforded
you so much pleasure when it appeared in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178"></span>the mirror. It is true, that I travel more
quickly than other mortals, yet the journey
is long, the business important, and long
must be our separation. In the meanwhile,
then, live retired and peaceably, look not often
through the windows, and, if thou wilt be
guided by my counsels, walk seldom or never
on the ramparts. During this time thy brother
will not appear at the castle, for I have
already informed him by a messenger that he
must not come hither; yet thou shalt not
want for pastime: the mirror will unfold
its rarest and most varied scenery; the golden
rings, the harps and cymbals, will delight you
with their music; the lake reflect the pleasant
moonshine, and the flowers give out their
fragrance, even as if I were here present.
But, dearest child, remember that thou
should’st not with thine own hand withdraw
the curtain from the mirror, attempt not to
move the golden rings when they are still,
and never touch the flowers. When thou hast
need of aught, or hast formed any wish, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179"></span>sing a ballad to thy lute, or play on it a few
notes, and thy desires will be fulfilled.
Have patience, dear child, be obedient and
humble in spirit; then we shall live together,
and all will turn out well.”</p>

<p>With these words she kissed the astonished
damsel, and in silence returned to her chamber.
On the following morning Bertha sought all
through the castle for the Lady Minnatrost,
but in vain, for she was no where to be found.</p>

<p class="center">
How the Lady Bertha fled from the Druda’s castle.
</p>


<p>Bertha had spent several days of solitude
in calmness and peace. From the great
hall she was serenaded by delightful music;
the mirror had displayed all her favourite
landscapes; and, though she was without
any companion, and had the sole charge of
the castle, yet her duties were by invisible
hands rendered so light, that they seemed
like a mere game contrived for her entertainment.
Thus, one afternoon she stepped
into the bark, in order to enjoy for some time
the cool fragrant air on the water. The day
was so lovely, that even the light fleecy clouds
in heaven appeared to dance for joy as they
were driven along by the zephyrs; there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181"></span>also numberless singing birds that came flying
round the castle towers, playing and chasing
each other among the white flowers that grew
thereon. They seemed to her like ambassadors,
bearing joyful tidings from the world
which she had been forbid to look upon, and
yet insensibly the wish grew upon her, that
she might indulge in one fleeting glance from
out these lonely walls. “What harm,” said
she to herself, “could possibly come of this?
It is doubtful even whether I have rightly
understood the lady’s admonition. Merely to
look for a moment on that world, of which I
was born to be an inhabitant, cannot surely
have evil consequences.” Almost as soon as
the thought was formed had Bertha turned
the bark again towards the shore, and re-entered
the castle. Then, as her aunt’s instructions
not to look out from the windows
had been less strict than against walking
on the ramparts, she thought that she
proved her self-command and obedience, by
passing quickly through the inviting garden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182"></span>of snow-white flowers, and entering a chamber,
at the window of which she had often seen
her aunt when she was speaking with her
brother from the battlements. In this room
there was nothing mysterious, and immediately
Bertha drew open the lattice, with its
painted glass, and began to gaze out over the
wide landscape.</p>

<p>From hence she indeed beheld a beautiful
prospect across rich-blooming meadows and
valleys towards the sea, on which the sun
now shone with full refulgence and glory.
There too she saw a beautiful island, which
lay with its verdant woods like a green
emerald amid the blue waters. A strange
mood of mind now came over the lonely
damsel. She felt attracted towards that
island with an irresistible longing, and could
not help believing that Sir Otto von Trautwangen
dwelt thereon, that he had built
for himself a hermitage under the green
shade of the trees, where he had completely
forgot the attractions of the noble Gabrielle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183"></span>and waited anxiously for the reappearance
of his beloved Bertha. At first this was
like a dream, but every moment its influence
became more powerful, and had more of reality.
She thought that she could distinguish
blooming gardens, parterres, and winding-walks,
which Sir Otto had cultivated around
his hermitage; and soon afterwards she marked
a boat approaching the shore, floating about
on the sun-illumined waters, in which she
could clearly distinguish her brother’s figure.
These were his very gestures,—his form,—the
colour and fashion of his garments!
“Good Heaven!” said she, “if indeed he
should have found Otto in that island, if he
should have been reconciled to his former adversary,
and wish to bring me across?” Thereafter
it seemed as if Sir Heerdegen waved
a white handkerchief, making her signs; but,
when she had drawn off her veil to return the
signal, she was withheld by an inward terror,
and hastily closed the window. With deep
melancholy she now thought on the good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184"></span>kind Lady Minnatrost; how sad and affectionate
had been her behaviour on the night
of her departure, and she wept bitterly,
because she had been even once disobedient
to her injunctions; yet, so weak are we, poor
mortals, in resisting temptation, that she
could not, even now, divert her thoughts
from the island and the boat, and, by way
of defence against herself, she said many
times aloud, “Thank Heaven, I have not
even the keys of the castle-gate!” Suddenly
the recollection occurred to her, that she
knew very well where they lay, and her
anxiety increased every moment, for she knew
not where to seek for help and consolation.</p>

<p>Anxious to find any object that might
divert her attention, she ran to the chamber
wherein was stationed the wonderful mirror.
On the way she brushed, with her garments,
a chair on which she had laid her lute, and
immediately it sounded, as if her once favourite
companion addressed to her words of
admonition and reproach; for the Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185"></span>Minnatrost had commanded her to play on the
lute, if she wished for aid, or had any desire
to gratify. Bertha, however, was too much
agitated to attend to sounds so light and
gentle; she ran breathless into the chamber,
and though the glass was covered with a
red curtain, which hung over it in deep mysterious
folds, yet, in a mood of wild forgetfulness,
she drew it suddenly away.</p>

<p>Over the whole surface of the mirror
there was then a dark waving and heaving,
like that of a stormy sea, as if its creations,
rashly looked upon, ere they were perfect,
shunned the light, and, therefore, were contorted
in frightful indeterminate shapes.
Thereupon Bertha wished to draw the curtain
over it; but as she was about to touch it
with her trembling hand, the forms which it
presented began to whirl in circles with such
vehemence, that she was terrified, and remained
motionless. At last there came forward
the figure of a man, pale and agitated,
and with the expression of wild anger on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186"></span>features. Unwillingly Bertha recognised in
this figure her brother Heerdegen. On his
head was placed somewhat like golden vulture’s
wings, and she knew not whether he
wore a helmet in this fashion, or if it were
indeed a vulture, whose attacks had thus
made him pale and enraged. While she reflected
on this, a female figure, wounded and
bleeding, made its appearance, and looking
on it but for a moment, Bertha screamed
aloud, “Have mercy, Heaven!” for she
recognised that the features were her own.
Terrified by this phantom, and even by the
sound of her own voice, she rushed out of the
chamber into the hall, in which hung the
golden rings. They were now silent and
motionless, as if held by invisible bands, and
at this time, above all others, Bertha would
have rejoiced in the slightest sounds of their
former music; for it seemed to her disordered
fantasy, as if the fearful shapes in the mirror
had started out into real life; that they were
moving through the apartment which she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187"></span>left with rustling garments and sounding
steps. How glad would she have been,
therefore, if the magic rings, the harps, and
cymbals, had overpowered those fearful
sounds, and the terror by which her heart
was now oppressed! Then she, indeed, remembered
the lady’s instructions, that by a few
notes on her lute she was to obtain whatever
she wished for in this enchanted castle. But,
alas! her voice was rendered powerless by
fear, and in order to obtain her lute, she
must have passed again through the frightful
apartment with the mirror. Horror deprived
her of all self-possession; so that, as if supernaturally
compelled, she touched one of the
golden rings;—immediately they all began to
move and to sound aloud; but, alas! not in
harmonious music. Their tones were like an
awful mixture of thunder and tempestuous
winds, or hoarse roaring as of wild beasts,—then
there was the clashing of swords as in
battle, and at intervals arose lamentable moanings,
as of the wounded and dying. At length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188"></span>the rings began to turn in furious haste; the
noises were more and more hideous, accompanied
too by yells of unearthly fiendish
laughter; so that Bertha was attacked by
fearful giddiness, and could scarcely support
herself. There was then a loud knocking at
the door, which communicated with the
chamber of the mirror. Bertha thought she
could not refrain from calling out, “Who is
there?” And that she would then be answered
by her own voice,—that she would behold
her own form enter, pale, dishevelled, and
bleeding,—that the horrid spectre would
stretch out its arms to seize upon her! Half
delirious, she rushed out of the hall, ran along
the corridor down stairs, and through the
court, till she found herself on the banks of
the lake, which, instead of being serene and
still as before, now heaved and raged with
waves like those of a stormy sea! All was
indeed changed around her; most of the
white flowers had grown blood-red, and
waved downwards like flames from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189"></span>ramparts, as if threatening and angrily against
her. How was her terror augmented, however,
when, on gaining the opposite bank of
the lake, she remembered that she had not
brought the keys of the gate! Should she
now return to that scene of horrors? Such
attempt would have been vain, as she felt
that utter madness would ensue. So she ran
onward, calling aloud on her brother, though
she might have well known, that within these
walls he could not render her assistance.
But the gates stood wide open, while their
ponderous wings moved as if agitated by a
hurricane, threatening to close and crush to
death any one who would venture beyond the
portal. However, the damsel took courage,
and rushed forwards. Scarcely was she on
the other side, when the gates closed with a
horrible crash; so that, perceiving how narrowly
she had escaped with life, she fled, swift
as an arrow, down the hill, and when arrived
in the plain beneath, sunk down on the
ground, exhausted and motionless. She heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190"></span>on all sides the murmuring of voices, and
confused clashing of armour and weapons,
and on half recovering her self-possession,
perceived that she was carried in her brother’s
arms, and that he said, as if communing with
himself, “We must bring her into the boat,
and cross over to the island, for the people
here are mad with terror at the horrid sights
on the castle ramparts.” Then Bertha, remembering
the prospect which she had seen
from the window, faintly whispered, “Oh
yes! let us go to that beloved island!” But
thereafter she again closed her eyes, wearied
and insensible.</p>

<p class="center">
Of a fearful combat betwixt Sir Heerdegen and the Knight<br>
of the Sea.
</p>


<p>Having once more awoke, she found herself
reclining on the turf,—her brother kneeling
beside her, and anxiously employed for her
recovery. Still she heard the same wild
murmuring of voices and clang of weapons
from the main land, and then looking
at the boat which had brought them
across, “Thank Heaven,” said she, “that
we are now in the island!” “Ay, truly,”
said her brother, “we are safer here; for, on
account of the thundering noises and frightful
sights at the Druda’s castle, the people
have all risen up in arms, partly to assist the
lady, whom they supposed in danger, and
partly to attack each other, since the disturbance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192"></span>in her hitherto silent and peaceful abode
seems like a signal for the renewal of their
contentions. That is indeed no longer a fitting
habitation for a timid damsel; and we must
endeavour to remove from it as far as possible.”
“Wherefore then should we leave
this island?” said Bertha; “here surely we
might remain in peace and joy. Follow me,
for I already know whither we should go.”
With these words, she stept boldly onwards
into the green thickets, convinced that she
should find there the hermitage of her
lover, Sir Otto von Trautwangen, according
to the visionary prospect which she had
beheld from the window of the lady’s castle.
Her brother thought, that what she had now
said might be the result of secret information
received from the Lady Minnatrost, and went
silently after her into the woodland coverts.</p>

<p>There, however, they found no flowery
parterres, nor gravel walks, nor aught which
she had expected at her lover’s habitation.
Bertha, however, was not discouraged, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193"></span>persisted in her search. She was even
tempted to call aloud on Sir Otto by name,
only that she was afraid of rousing her
brother to anger. Meanwhile, the branches
of the trees became always more and more
densely interwoven; their roots always made
the damp ground more uneven; serpents,
too, and other reptiles, disturbed by the
unaccustomed tread of human visitors,
were visible, writhing or crawling among
the tall grass. At length the clear light
of the ocean waves appeared once more on
the other side of the island; and on reaching
the shore, Bertha only found a wild
country, where the evening sun was now
shedding his rays upon old Runick tombs
and monuments, and the wind rustled mournfully
among the luxuriant moss and tall
grass by which they were covered. Weeping
bitterly, the disappointed damsel sat
down on one of these old tomb-stones, and,
with a painful feeling of resignation, exclaimed,—“So
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194"></span>then, all that I was destined to
find on this island was but a grave!” The
more that her brother questioned and tried to
console her, the more her affliction increased.
She felt all the bitterness of disappointment
and shame at the self-confidence which she
had just before shewn.</p>

<p>Sir Heerdegen, perplexed and mortified,
began to pour forth reproaches on the mysterious
lady of the castle, by whose magic arts
he supposed that she had been thus led astray.
On the first mention of the Druda’s name, a
new source of regret and sorrow was opened
for the unfortunate Bertha. She called to
mind once more the solemn admonitions, the
affectionate embraces, the heart-drawn tears
of her aunt at their last interview, and the
hopes then expressed of the future happiness
that was in store for them. She became
quite overpowered by these melancholy reflections,
and her brother’s impatience increased
every moment. At length they heard near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195"></span>them the sound of a clear and melodious
female voice, which sung a few words, of
which the import was as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Blood-red berries, leaves so green,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Brew drink for heroes meet, I ween.”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Looking up, Bertha saw a tall female
figure walking about on the sea-shore, sometimes
stooping down as if to pluck flowers
from the turf, sometimes pulling leaves from
branches over her head, all which she threw
into a great golden cup under her arm. Over
the neck and shoulders of this stranger waved
luxuriant blond tresses; and when she bent
down her head, they fell also like a veil over her
features. She wore a richly-embroidered garment,
(such as betokened her to be of high
rank,) but carelessly girdled, and with the
skirts folded up, as if for a journey. From
a belt round her waist hung a large glittering
sword, and from her neck behind were suspended
a bow and quiver. She continued
her employment in collecting plants, all the
while singing a wild melody, to which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196"></span>brother and sister listened, forgetting for a
space their own sorrows; for the figure of the
stranger had irresistibly attracted their attention,
and her music too was such as they
had never before heard. Her songs alluded
throughout to some extraordinary drink,
which rendered warriors furious in battle, and
altogether invincible, as if they wore enchanted
armour. Every stanza, however, closed with
soft melancholy notes, whereby she cautioned
the stranger against drinking too freely from
the cup which possessed such power of inspiration.
Just as the mysterious stranger was
bending down to the grassy shore, Heerdegen
happened involuntary to exclaim,—“Good
Heavens, how beautiful must be her features!”
Whereupon she suddenly reared herself in her
full height, like a tall pine-tree, and the
beauty of her countenance, being fully revealed,
gleamed with a sun-like splendour through
that desolate wilderness. Her large blue eyes
flashed with anger, and in a stern threatening
tone, she said,—“You have disturbed me!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197"></span>What boots it now this mild auspicious evening?
What avails it that so many bright and
precious flowers are assembled?” With these
words she emptied the golden cup, so that
her collected treasures were scattered on the
turf. Sir Heerdegen wished to draw nearer
and beg her forgiveness; but immediately
she unsheathed her sword, and made him a
sign that he was to keep at a distance. Then
she stepped solemnly on to the water’s brink,
took her place in a boat which was there
waiting for her, and with the strength and
rapidity of a practised rower, made her way
out among the waves, soon afterwards disappearing
behind a wooded promontory. The
brother and sister looked after her with astonishment;
and as, after a pause, they were
about to express their thoughts, Bertha suddenly
started up, and cried out, “Look yonder,
dearest brother! What objects are those that
wave and rock over the woods? Methinks they
are like the masts of a great fleet.” Looking
in the direction to which she had pointed, Sir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198"></span>Heerdegen perceived not indeed ship-masts,
but the heads of enormous halberts, which
rose above the copsewood, and were moving
towards him. In a short time many of the
warriors, by whom these weapons were carried,
stepped out of the thickets. These were
gigantic figures cased in iron cuirasses, which
rung and rattled at every step, and bearing
great shields covered with brass on their left
shoulders. Sir Heerdegen started up, and
laid his hand on his sword; but, lo! from the
other side, there came out of the wood an
equal number of armed men! A handsome
youth, in a hauberk that shone like gold,
with a high towering helmet, surmounted
strangely by vulture’s wings, stepped forwards
from the troop, pointed with his spear
at the brother and sister, and said, “Take
them prisoners, and bear them on shipboard!”
“What right hast thou over us, who are
freeborn?” said Sir Heerdegen, drawing his
sword, and wielding it with desperate resolution.
“Walk behind me, Bertha,” said he,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199"></span>“and whoever dares first attack us, shall
with his life pay the forfeit of his insolence!”
Then all around there was a quivering of
javelins ready to be sent against the unfortunate
young people; but the leader in the
golden armour called out, “Down with your
arms! I will have them living!” Whereupon
the javelins were laid aside; but the broad
shields were ranked together like a wall of
brass, and an impenetrable circle was always
drawn closer and closer round the helpless
victims. “Fy on this abuse of over-strength!”
cried Sir Heerdegen; “if thou in the golden
harness hadst courage in thy heart, and wert
a knight as I am, this contest might be decided
in another way!” “Halt!” cried the
young leader, and the giants with their
brazen shields stood as if motionless. Thereafter
he came alone within the circle, placed
himself opposite to Sir Heerdegen, leaned on
the hilt of his long sword, and said, “Darest
thou then maintain that thou art a knight,
and yet wearest no armour?” “Did I then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200"></span>come forth prepared for battle?” inquired
Sir Heerdegen. “I was this evening engaged
in peaceable conversation with my
sister, and for what reason could I suppose
that we should be thus attacked?” “That
should have been provided for,” said the
stranger; “if you have withheld from me the
tributary dues which I have a right to demand,
then I take in lieu of them whatever
best pleases me, and bear it on board my
ships. Now it so happens, that my pleasure
is to take both of you along with me, although,
in your weatherbeaten doublet and
cap, you make an appearance very different
from that which your chiefs are wont to display.”
“In this land I am neither chief nor
vassal,” said Sir Heerdegen. “I am a
stranger knight; and as for gorgeous apparel,
on that head I give myself no concern.”
“In truth, that may be plainly enough
perceived,” said the leader with a scornful
smile; “and as for thy knighthood, who
knows whether thy words on that subject be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201"></span>true or false. Take them prisoners!” Thereupon
the circle of brazen shields began once
more to close together; but Sir Heerdegen
cried out, “Halt!” in such a thundering voice,
that the iron-cased giants stood motionless, as
if they had heard the commands of their own
leader. “I recognise you now for Normans,”
said Sir Heerdegen. “Your language,
figures, and dress, leave me no doubt on that
score. Normans should be valiant champions,
who love single combat, whether with the
lance or the sword, and every noble and
daring encounter. I, therefore, challenge
thee, thou leader of this band, to try thy skill
and strength with me in arms. Let the conqueror
decide what is to become of me and
of my sister.” “Ay, that indeed must be
listened to,” said the youth with the golden
armour. “Give room then, soldiers, and
make a fitting circle around us; for I now
perceive that we have to do with a true
knight. But there is first one question to be
answered, Canst thou wield our weapons, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202"></span>I have no others to offer thee?” “Dost thou
look on me as an inexperienced boy?” said
Sir Heerdegen. “A warrior who has spent
so much of his time in the wild regions of the
north as I have done, should methinks know
how to use arms as ponderous as any that
thou art likely to offer me. Give me then a
spear and a massive shield.” Thereupon the
leader commanded, that a fine coat of mail, a
helmet, and target, should immediately be
brought, also a number of the best javelins,
among which he left his opponent the free
choice. “As for swords,” said the stranger,
“I have not ordered them to be provided, as
I perceive that thou hast one by thy side,
and that which we have already worn and
proved, is among us warriors like an old
friend, in whom, at the hour of need, we can
best confide.”</p>

<p>Sir Heerdegen then began to arm himself
for battle, at which the stranger assisted,
saying, “Canst thou now perceive that I
am a true knight? At first I knew not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203"></span>well what were thy pretensions, nor if I had
one who was my equal in birth and in courage
before me. Since thou hast travelled in the
north, it must probably be known to thee,
that we knights of the sea, not only can maintain
our rights on the battle-field, but can
also shew towards our opponents forbearance
and courtesy.” “I know it well,” answered
Sir Heerdegen, “and, confiding in your honour,
I challenged thee to single combat. But,
before all other considerations, tell me now,
Sir Knight, hast thou been sent hither by the
beautiful damsel, with the golden cup and the
sword, as her avenger, because I disturbed
her when she was collecting leaves, berries,
and flowers?” “I know not even,” said the
sea-knight, “of what damsel thou speakest;—except
that beautiful trembling form there,
whom thou callest thy sister, I know not
of any fair damsel, far or near. Thou
shouldst, therefore, explain more clearly what
adventure thy question alludes to.” Sir
Heerdegen complied; and no sooner had he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204"></span>finished his description of the wonderful
figure that he had seen on the sea-shore,
than the Norman warrior turned round to
some of his companions, who were nearest
him, and said, “Think only! Gerda has been
here, and this but half an hour ago. In these
woods she has been collecting plants for her
magic spells. What may this portend?” The
men thus questioned, shook their heads discontentedly
and in silence. When at length
they seemed about to speak, their answer
was delayed; for a young soldier came up to
them hastily, and said, “To what purpose
this questioning and consultation? He who
intends to fight during the last rays of sunset
let him make haste, and not confuse his
brain with such doubts. If he remains alive,
he will have time enough afterwards for consideration;
and should he fall, he will no
more be disquieted by his curiosity.” So
then, as Sir Heerdegen was completely
armed, and had also chosen a shield and
javelin among many that were offered to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205"></span>him, the two champions stepped into the
ring, which, according to northern custom,
had been measured out for them, and enclosed
with branches of oak and hazel. A
hoary-headed warrior led each of the combatants
to his place, grasped his hand at
parting, saying, “Now do your duty!” after
which they were left alone looking at each
other.</p>

<p>With their spears elevated, and their
shields held for protection over their hearts,
the knights began slowly and with measured
steps to pace round the circle, each watching
his opportunity to make an attack on the
other. Bertha indeed remarked, with great
terror, that her brother was quite unaccustomed
to the use of such weapons,—that
he moved tottering and awkwardly under
the weight of the gigantic shield, and tried
laboriously to balance the ponderous javelin;
while, on the contrary, the sea-knight played
with his as if it had been a mere toy in his
right hand. Courage, however, and a quiet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206"></span>enjoyment of the battle, gleamed equally in
the eyes of both, and if the looks which they
darted at each other could have turned into
javelins, they must have both been pierced to
the heart. Sometimes one or other would
brandish his spear in such manner, that the
lookers-on felt convinced that he would now
hurl it at his opponent; but this was only intended
to force the latter into a hasty attack,
or into some incautious movement of his
shield. Both resumed again their solemn
course round the circle, keeping watch
mutually on every gesture. At last, Sir
Heerdegen’s spear came suddenly singing
through the air; whereupon the knight of
the vulture’s wings turned round his gleaming
shield like a revolving moon, received
the blow right in the middle of his target,
and threw back the missile against his adversary.
Almost in the same moment his
own weapon took flight, and struck with such
violence through the border of Sir Heerdegen’s
shield, that he was unable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207"></span>withstand the shock, but fell under his target,
and the spear at the same time entering the
ground, he could not immediately disengage
himself. On the other hand, the sea-knight
leapt across like a tiger on his prey, first grasping
him by the throat, then confining his arms
with one hand, while with the other he seized
the hilt of his sword, pulled it out of the
sheath, and hurled it away far beyond the
limits of the circle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bertha beheld with horror her
brother thus prostrate on the ground, and saw
the vulture’s wings on the sea-knight’s helmet,
shadowing his countenance that was now pale
with rage; she thought of the horrid vision
that she had seen in the mirror, and screamed
out, “Vulture, vulture! have mercy on the
noble prey that thou hast captured!” Then
the sea-knight smiled kindly on her, and said,—“I
shall do him no injury!” He bent again
over Sir Heerdegen, saying,—“Thou art
defenceless, wilt thou resign thyself? If
so, be assured thou art in the hands of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208"></span>honourable conqueror.” Heerdegen hung
down his head with an expression of bitter
regret and shame. The Norman then let him
go, and went smiling to Bertha. “I trust,”
said he, “that neither of you will regret the
necessity you are now under of making a
voyage with me for some time through the
salt seas. I have honourably taken you
prisoners; and, with regard to the damsel,
the difference methinks is no more, than if
she had two brothers instead of one. This
newly-acquired brother is the elder of the
two, or at least passes for such; and therefore
it is right that you should follow his
commands, and proceed in any path wherein
he leads the way.” Thereupon he cried
aloud,—“Let the boat be drawn up on the
beach. Set sail in the ships! We must
travel many miles yet by star-light!”</p>

<p>Already, ere the sun had vanished over the
mountains, the brother and sister had embarked
in the state-vessel of the sea-knight, and
floated away. The fleet consisted of but three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209"></span>ships, rapid of motion and strangely rigged.
Bertha was forced to stand on the deck, and
wept bitterly when the shores gradually
vanished from her view,—when the evening
fogs gathered on the land, and spread themselves
out, as if, with longing arms, to
embrace her. It was like a friendly salutation
from the good-hearted, kind Lady
Minnatrost. “Gladly would I go back to
her,” said Bertha; “oh how gladly! But I
shall never return again!” At that moment,
a snow-white wood-pigeon flew around her,
and cooed aloud; but the land vanished quite
away in the obscurity of the night, and, as it
were, melted into the waves.</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto von Trautwangen and the merchant<br>
Theobaldo fared in France.
</p>


<p>Some time after these events happened on the
shores of the north sea, Sir Otto von Trautwangen
and his friend Theobaldo were one
day seated together on the turf beneath the
luxuriant shade of a forest in France; the sun
was high in the cloudless heaven, and his
rays, without scorching, made a fine play of
light and shade as they descended through
the leafy covert. Their horses meanwhile
grazed tranquilly in a neighbouring glade;
for, notwithstanding the fiery temper of Sir
Otto’s charger, they had made acquaintance
during their long journey; so that the chestnut-coloured
Pole led as quiet a life with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211"></span>companion as he could desire. Sir Otto
seemed lost in thought. He leaned backwards
against the trunk of a tree, gazing
up to the cloudless azure of heaven; so,
while he was thus abstracted, Theobaldo
took up a mandoline, which he always
carried with him on his journey, and sang
to its notes a few stanzas in praise of travelling
and constant change of scene. “Hold,
hold!” said Sir Otto, awakening from his
reverie; “I cannot join in that ballad.”
“Who desired that you should do so?” said
Theobaldo, smiling. “Sing another. Few
people can bear to repeat the same notes over
and over, far less to hear them repeated; on
which account there are so many poets and
musicians.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I have no wish to sing,” said Otto.
“My heart is oppressed with a longing which
music cannot gratify. Tell me, Theobaldo,
is it not wholly inexplicable, that two such
distinguished characters as Sir Folko de
Montfaucon and his sister Gabrielle, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212"></span>whose names all France rings, should thus
evade all our endeavours to discover them?”</p>

<p>“They are indeed like figures reflected from
many mirrors,—like sounds repeated by manifold
echoes,” answered Theobaldo. “The
very rumours that we have heard of them
render our senses confused, and defeat all
our attempts. They are, in truth, become
like phantoms from the ancient world of
wonders and chivalry, of which every one
relates whatever seems most incredible, and
thinks that, under the auspices of such names,
he has a right to demand belief for that
which is the work of his own invention.
They are idolized during their lifetime; and
for this very reason, are, like other idols,
no more in reality to be discovered.”</p>

<p>“You wish that I should laugh,” said Sir
Otto; “but give me the mandoline. Rather
than this I shall sing.”</p>

<p>“Mark you now,” said Theobaldo; “this
is indeed what I desired. Sing, I pray you;
for music may, in truth, be impersonized as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213"></span>the purest and kindest angel, who is permitted
by Providence to visit and console unhappy
mortals.”</p>

<p>Otto then touched the lute, and sung to its
accompaniment an address to a little bird that
was just then fluttering above him:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">“Sweet bird, that thus on rapid wing</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Ascend’st to realms above,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Oh! could’st thou point to me the path</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That leads unto my love!</div>
<div class="verse indent0">But, ah! thy course is wandering too;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">So thou perchance art crost</div>
<div class="verse indent0">By fruitless longing, even as I,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And thy true love hast lost!”</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>“It is strange,” said Theobaldo, “when,
in this foreign land, you speak your native
tongue, vehemently indeed, and with passion,
it seems as if the very woods, flowers, and
fountains, were amazed at such harsh and unwonted
sounds. But when you begin to sing,
all is again tranquil, happy, and harmonious;
for music is indeed a universal language.
Mark, I pray you, what grand adventure is
announced as your reward by the stranger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214"></span>who just now makes his appearance from the
thickets!”</p>

<p>Lifting up his eyes, Otto indeed saw that
a young man, handsomely attired, and mounted
on a white horse, just then came riding
out of the wood. He wore a plaited green
dress, like that of a minstrel, and over it
a magnificent gold chain, by which his harp
was suspended from his neck. All the
while he continued to play thereupon; for
his horse was so quiet and sensible, that of
his own accord he turned away from the
down-hanging branches, so that his rider
might not be interrupted by them in his
employment. Coming up near to Sir Otto
and the merchant Theobaldo, he halted, and
said,—“Was it then your voices which I
just now heard sound so harmoniously through
the forest?” When Otto courteously answered
in the affirmative, the stranger dismounted,
saying,—“Permit me then to have the pleasure
of joining for a while in your amusements.”
Thereupon he took the bridle from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215"></span>his horse, and allowed him to graze at liberty
in the glades of the forest. At the same
moment, Otto’s war-steed came up snorting
and neighing, prepared for a combat with his
new neighbour; from which the latter shrunk
back affrighted, and, as if seeking protection,
trotted away to his master. Then Sir Otto
spoke aloud some words of severe admonition
to his charger; whereupon he betook himself
quietly to the society of the chesnut Pole;
and the minstrel’s horse regaining courage,
went curvetting and caprioling back to the
pasture.</p>

<p>“We are, perhaps, all three going the
same road,” said the minstrel, “and I trust
it may be so. Wherever I now see a
knight cased in armour, I cannot but suppose
that he is travelling, or means to
travel, into the Holy Land,” “Alas! it is not
so with me,” answered Sir Otto blushing;
“earnestly as I would wish to go thither.
A solemn vow which I have made drives
me onwards evermore towards the west,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216"></span>notwithstanding the ardent longings of my
soul towards the warm suns of the oriental
climes.” “It grieves me heartily to hear
this,” said the minstrel; “it would have
been so pleasant to travel in your society.
But as the matter now stands, you are in
the right. A vow made is a sacred pledge
which must be redeemed; and that knight
would indeed be unworthy of his rank,
who could forget this duty even for the sake
of journeying into Palestine. For the present,
however, will you not sing again?” “I know
not,” answered Sir Otto; “but, in truth,
were I to sing, both words and notes would
be mournful; for what you have just now
said of the Holy Land has made too deep
an impression on my heart;—much rather
would I hear music from you.” “Nay,”
said the stranger, “I know not aught of
which I can chaunt but those eastern climes,
of which the very name has already made
you sad. However, if you are willing to
listen, I am prepared.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217"></span></p>
<p>Thereupon he commenced a long and
beautiful ballad, of which every stanza was
fashioned in praise of the crusaders, and, above
all, of King Richard Cœur de Lion. Otto’s
cheeks glowed, and he would have gladly left
every other pursuit in this world, in order to
go with the wonderful minstrel after the banners
of King Richard to the east. He was
just about to inquire whether the stranger
knew if Sir Folko de Montfaucon were also
among the crusaders; for if every separate
contest between the champions of this age
might be deferred, and they could all join
together in this enterprise against the Saracens,
it would assuredly prove the most glorious
and successful war that had ever been
known in the world. But ere he had time
to propose that question, there came a troop
of armed men from the thickets, who spoke
very respectfully with the minstrel; whereupon
he ordered them again to put the bridle
on his white horse, and immediately afterwards,
with a courteous salutation, rode away.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218"></span>One of his attendants lingered, however, and
Sir Otto had time to ask him what was the
name and rank of his master. “He is,”
said the squire, “the renowned Master
Blondel, the best minstrel in all England,
and the bosom-friend of King Richard; on
which account he is to accompany our army
to Palestine. We are ordered by the king
to attend him, that he may not be attacked
and suffer injury, when, as now, he leaves
the straight road, in order to make excursions
hither and thither, as minstrels and poets
are wont to do.” Thereupon he mounted his
horse, and rode gaily on to overtake his comrades,
whose voices were heard from afar, joining
the minstrel in a choral song, which resounded
merrily through the forest. “Seems
it not,” said Sir Otto, “as if all the best enjoyments
and noblest duties of this life were
destined always to come under our notice, only
to mock and torment us, because they are now
wholly out of our own reach? Or, as your
looks now seem to indicate your dissent from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219"></span>what I have said, it will be better that I
speak for myself alone. Is not this adventure
of to-day like the contrivance of some wicked
magician, who specially wishes that I should
feel, as it were within my grasp, all that
appears to me most estimable and desirable,
only to be reminded more painfully of the
chains by which I am bound, and which I
dare not strive to break asunder?”</p>

<p>“In truth,” said Theobaldo, “I might
have more reason than you to complain of
this matter; for, if you have bound yourself
by rash vows, I know not of any such which
I have ever sworn. Yet I remain here,
though Heaven knows how gladly I would
have followed this noble minstrel on his way
to Palestine!” “Leave me then for ever,
Theobaldo,” said Sir Otto. “I have already
undergone so many painful separations, that
I may well feel accustomed thereto.”</p>

<p>Theobaldo gazed on him kindly, and said
in a faltering voice,—“No, God forbid that
I should forsake you. But desist from such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220"></span>lamentations, and once more lift up your eyes.
Mark, I pray you, how the light fleecy clouds,
the verdant branches of the forest, and the
soaring larks, play betwixt us and the bright
expanse of heaven. Methinks from a sky so
beauteous and smiling must descend balm and
refreshment for all the sorrows of this world.”
Otto looked up and said,—“Thou art in the
right; and, in truth, nothing can better serve
to counteract useless grief and repining, than
to look on that glorious vault, with its moving
clouds and boundless depths of azure, which
is now so bright above us!”</p>

<p>For some time the two youths lay outstretched
on the turf, with their eyes fixed on
the sky, when, lo! there came sailing through
the air, right above them, a most beautiful
falcon, at such a height that he seemed to
them to be even above the sun, for the rays of
golden light came under his wings and body.
Rejoiced at this sight, Otto started up, and
called and whistled like a true-bred falconer
to the bird, which, however, would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221"></span>come down to him. It was indeed easy to
perceive that the hawk understood his signals,
lowering its flight, for a certain space, and
wheeling in circles round the knight. Thereafter,
on a signal audibly made to him from
another quarter of the forest, he clapped his
wings, and resolutely made his way thither,
swift as an arrow, over the trees. It was
plain that he had now heard the voice of his
proper master. “I am glad that he is gone,”
said Theobaldo; “there is nothing which
is to me more intolerable than a bird of this
kind, thief and rogue as he is, with his crooked
hook-bill, his glaring eyes, and long robberlike
claws! What pleasure could you find in
making him signals?” “After your manner,”
said Sir Otto, “every animal or bird might
be described as a monster; but I love all such
creatures, and more especially the falcon,
who is so wise and so faithful.” “Wise!”
answered Theobaldo; “the devil himself has
also wisdom; and if you call it fidelity to
seize on every victim that falls within his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222"></span>power with his crooked talons, the devil too
might boast of that virtue.” “You have
never then rode out on a hawking excursion?”
said Sir Otto. “It is among the
prejudices of knightly rank,” answered Theobaldo,
“to look on such things as a source of
enjoyment.” “Nay, say not so,” replied Sir
Otto; “such pastime is, on the contrary,
like a twofold life. Above us are the winged
hunters of the air; while beneath we have
fleet horses, whirling us around the plains and
meadows, while the free winds of heaven are
whistling through our dishevelled hair, and
we are cheered by the jocund shouts of the
sportsmen. At length the falcon, like a
magician, wheels in circles round his devoted
prey, hovering and gleaming over him, till
at last he comes down, and—and”——</p>

<p>At this moment Theobaldo’s bow sounded
with a loud reverberation; and Otto, confused
and disturbed in his discourse, looked round,
till he saw the noble bird descending rapidly,
vainly fluttering to support himself, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223"></span>an arrow through one of his wings, over that
side of the wood to which he had directed his
flight when he left them. “Who commanded
thee to injure the bird which I loved so
dearly?” said the young knight, with his eyes
darkly flashing. “I knew not surely that it
was your falcon,” said Theobaldo; “and if,
according to your own words, you love all such
creatures, you should rejoice that the arrow
which I have now shot has rescued some poor
timid songster, which had concealed itself in
the thickets of the forest.” “Thou art not
appointed to be a judge in the wide realms
of the eagle,” said Otto, discontentedly.
“It may be so,” said Theobaldo; “nor, methinks,
art thou more than any other mortal
privileged to be a hunter therein.”</p>

<p>In this dispute, however, the young men
were soon disturbed by the presence of a
third party.</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto met again with the Knight of Montfaucon.
</p>


<p>Mounted on a fine silver-grey horse, in a
magnificent hunter’s dress, with a bugle-horn
at his side, a young man of handsome features
and graceful demeanour made his appearance
before them. At the same moment, when
Otto saw the bleeding falcon supported on
the breast of the stranger, the latter observed
the cross-bow in the hands of Theobaldo, and
considering him as but a squire, he turned an
angry glance on the knight, saying,—“If it
pleases you, sir, to allow your attendants to
hunt in my forests, you indeed impute to me no
more hospitality and civility towards strangers,
that I am willing to shew. But, nevertheless,
I must earnestly request, that, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225"></span>future, you will content yourself with humbler
game, and spare so noble a bird as this
which your squire has now wounded.” Thereupon
he tenderly stroked the head and back
of the poor stricken falcon, with many kind
and caressing words, and without attending
to Sir Otto’s apologies, which, in truth,
were but confusedly delivered; for he was
himself greatly irritated by Theobaldo’s
strange conduct. The latter, however, had
now become more obstinate than ever. He
went up with a look of defiance to the
stranger sportsman, and said,—“It was I
alone, without being commanded, or receiving
permission from any one, who took aim
at your falcon; and I only, therefore, am to
be spoken with on that matter.” “Stand
back, Theobaldo,” said Sir Otto; “thou
seem’st not aware of the guilt thou hast
brought on thine own shoulders, in thus having
infringed the laws of hunting and of
knighthood, by taking aim at a prey so noble.”
“Nay, I know it all full well,” answered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226"></span>Theobaldo. “You princes and knights
have divided this world into special portions
for your own private advantage; and as to
the rights freely bestowed by Providence on
other men, it is said, that they never must
exercise them. Mark you, sirs, it is <i>said</i>
so; but it follows not that the rules you have
laid down will always be observed. That
independence which Milan has maintained as
a free town, every Milanese will also support
in his own proper person, in despite of king
or emperor, count or duke. In proof of these
words, I shall now shoot a few more birds.”
And, with these words, he again stretched his
cross-bow. “You have, in truth, chosen a
strange-minded squire for your attendant,
Sir Knight,” observed the stranger. But
thereupon Sir Otto, vehemently incensed,
and feeling the spirit of knighthood insulted
and outraged within him, suddenly tore the
cross-bow out of Theobaldo’s hands, broke it
into pieces in a moment, stampt on it with his
feet, and then scattered the fragments about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227"></span>the meadow. “This conduct translated into
audible words,” said Theobaldo, “means no
doubt a last adieu!” And as the knight
turned from him with disdainful glances, he
went gloomily to his Polish steed, and began
to adjust the saddle and bridle. Otto’s war-horse
perceiving this, came also trotting up,
with kind and joyous looks; but Theobaldo
repulsed him peevishly, saying, “Ay, ay,
thou would’st yet bear me company, but thy
master wills it not, and, therefore, thou too
may go thine own way.” Otto, hearing this
new insult, called to his charger, drew the
saddle-girths closer, and mounted; after
which he readily accepted the stranger’s invitation,
that he should accompany him to
a neighbouring castle, in order that, amid
a numerous party of brother knights, he
might forget all vexation at the strange
event which had brought about their
meeting. Theobaldo was also mounted, and
rode slowly away, while Sir Otto and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228"></span>stranger took an opposite direction. The
two horses neighed aloud, and wished to rejoin
each other; but their riders still spurred
them on, although they could not help turning
round with looks of regret and melancholy.</p>

<p>Sir Otto had proceeded a considerable distance,
following the stranger, when they
heard the sound of a horse in rapid trot behind
them, and on looking back they saw
that it was Theobaldo, who pulled up the
reins immediately, as soon as he was observed,
and with a degree of humility which
was to him unwonted, said, in the German
language, and in a low tone, “Sir Knight,
methinks I have here been in the wrong,
and gladly would I still atone for my error,
if it please you that I should again join you
on your journey.” Sir Otto immediately
stretched out his arms towards him; whereupon
Theobaldo galloped up, and as the
two friends shook hands together, the Polish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229"></span>steed and the light-brown war-horse neighed
merrily to each other, as if they fully understood
what was now going forward.</p>

<p>As they all three rode onwards, the
noble falconer expressed great joy at this
reconciliation, insisting that knights should
willingly overlook many faults in squires
who were so faithful and attached; for on
such fidelity the safety even of kingdoms
and the relationship between monarchs many
times depended. Thereafter he began to tell
many marvellous stories of his wounded falcon,
and of other such birds,—how they had
been known to live till they were more than
an hundred years old, having been found
bearing golden collars round their necks, with
the names thereon of princes long since dead.
Such falcons then flew about over land and
sea, till they had discovered a master equal
in generosity, rank, and valour, to him that
was departed. Theobaldo hereupon acknowledged,
that all the opinions which he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230"></span>before uttered were rashly adopted, and
expressed deep regret for his conduct of that
morning.</p>

<p>Ere this time, however, Sir Otto, notwithstanding
the change of dress and demeanour,
had clearly perceived that the hunter of the
French forests was no other than the renowned
Sir Folko de Montfaucon; while the latter
by no means recognised, in the proud haughty
knight, in his black and silver armour, the
young inexperienced and talkative squire
whom he had formerly met on the banks
of the Danube. That armour indeed, with
the formidable eagle’s visor, was not unknown
to him; but Otto’s young blooming
countenance and light hair contrasted so
strangely with those accoutrements, that Sir
Folko could not form any distinct recollection.
In his mind all was like a dream,
which, on awaking, we vainly strive to renew,
and which in a short space is wholly forgotten.</p>

<p class="center">
How the Knights feasted in the Castle of Sir Folko de<br>
Montfaucon.
</p>


<p>In Sir Folko’s castle were now seated at
the banquet table many brave champions
from different nations, also various other
guests,—painters, minstrels, musicians, and
poets, among whom Theobaldo soon discovered
some of his lively countrymen.
Especially there was one named the Count
Alessandro Vinciguerra, with whom he began
to converse in a manner so witty and
cheerful that their discourse afforded amusement
to the whole company. Sir Otto meanwhile
remained thoughtful and silent, so that,
after the first admiration excited by his noble
form and graceful demeanour had subsided,
he was scarcely noticed by the party. As the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232"></span>wine-cups, mantling with the richest juice of
Medoc and Burgundy, circled round the
festive board, it occurred to the warriors, that,
for better pastime, every one should relate,
from the experiences of his life, some remarkable
story. Among so many valiant knights,
and other distinguished characters as were
here assembled, materials could not be wanting
for such narratives. All, however, insisted
that their noble host should set an example
to his guests,—to which he replied,
“I am aware that the excuses which I would
gladly offer would not relieve me from the
duties which I owe to the noble friends who
are now around me. What I have to relate
is indeed but of little importance; but I am
like a gardener, from whom a festal wreath
is demanded, and who, if he possesses not
roses and jasmine, must be content with
daisies and <i>forget-me-not</i>.</p>

<p>“It must be known,” continued he, “to
several who are here present, that our family
of Montfaucon derives its origin from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233"></span>Norwegian ancestors, and that in the mountains
of that wild country we have at this day
many noble relations. From thence my
predecessors came, as conquering invaders
into France,—arrived with great forces within
that district which is now called Normandy,
and with them brought, among other
strange stories, the legend which I am now to
repeat to you. In Norway there dwelt an
ancient and far-famed hero, who had an
amiable daughter, well known by the name
of the beautiful Sigrid. She was talked of
and praised all over that northern country,
and therefore had many loving suitors.
Besides her beauty, she was also distinguished
for her superiority in all female accomplishments,
having a deep knowledge of
magic and necromancy, to which pursuits the
young ladies of that land are particularly addicted.
Especially she had found means to
prepare a certain drink, which, if used in
moderation, inspired the warrior with unheard-of
strength and courage; nay, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234"></span>said, that he was thereby rendered even impenetrable
by the weapons of his adversary.
Many other women of Norway have been in
possession of the same charm, and one of our
relations at this day is in the habit of exercising
that wonderful art.</p>

<p>“So it happened, that once on a time the
old hero said to his daughter, ‘Pretty Sigrid,
leave your household cares for one day and go
forth into the woods,—pluck there the red
berries and green leaves that you wot of, for
to-morrow I shall need your aid. I have a
hard battle before me.’ ‘With whom then,
father, do you mean to fight?’ said the fair
Sigrid. ‘With the young Hakon Swendson,’
answered the old warrior, ‘who in his ambition
will wing his flight above me through
all the regions of the north, if I do not take
care in time to clip his wings. Besides, you
know that he is sprung from a race, betwixt
whom and us there is an old and deadly
feud.’ So the beautiful Sigrid went out towards
sunset into the dusky woods, alone and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235"></span>unprotected, according to the laws of her
mysterious science.</p>

<p>“Up and down the rocky cliffs, along the
banks of the woodland river, through many
a dim valley, and on the brink of many a
fearful precipice, the fair damsel pursued her
way, and by the time she had collected all
her roots, leaves, and berries, she found that
the night-shadows had already gathered
around her, and that she was alone in a district
of the forest which she had till now
never beheld. Her whole attention had been
fixed on her plants and flowers, and she had
never thought of the stars, that had shone
out one by one above her, and now, though
they glittered so brightly, yet she was quite
unable by their light to discover her road
homewards. While she thus stood meditative,
and doubtful what course to pursue, she
heard a great crashing and rustling through
the woods, and, behold! a frightful black bear,
rearing himself on his hind-legs, broke out as
if to devour her, or strangle her in his horrid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236"></span>embraces. Just as she had given herself up
for lost, a javelin came hissing through the
air over her head, and in the next moment
she saw the bear struck through the heart,
fall writhing on the ground, so that, in the
next moment, he rolled over a neighbouring
precipice.</p>

<p>“Thereafter a handsome young warrior
made his appearance from the recesses of the
forest, and respectfully offered to attend to
her own home the damsel, whom his interference
had thus rescued. The fair Sigrid,
however, wept bitterly; for in her terror she
had lost all her roots, berries, and leaves; so
that, according to the laws of magic, she
must begin the labour of collecting them
anew,—though the evening was far advanced,
and the country around her wholly new and
mysterious. ‘Search then, and pluck as
many more as it pleases you,’ said the young
knight. ‘I know, moreover, that at such
times one must be alone and undisturbed.
Therefore I shall walk round thee, fair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237"></span>stranger, making a wide circle, so that no one
shall speak with thee, nor approach too
nearly,—and ere the dawn of day I shall
lead you home to your father’s castle. Search
then, pretty maid, and fear not aught that
can befall you in these woods.’ With these
words the young knight vanished again amid
the forest thickets; the fair Sigrid continued
her employment as he had enjoined, and if, in
that lonely unknown place, terror now and
then assailed her, she felt herself immediately
refreshed and encouraged, when she heard the
rattling of the knight’s golden armour through
the distant green coppice.</p>

<p>“At length she had collected another store
like that which had been lost; and thereupon
it occurred to her how much better it would
be to boil them immediately in a golden
vessel which she had with her, so that she
might at once carry home with her the precious
drink which the old knight had desired
her to prepare. Directly after her first and
slightest signal, her protector was close at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238"></span>hand, and scarcely had she made her wishes
known to him, ere he began to gather dry
branches and brushwood, from which in a
moment arose bright flames, casting their
light far amid the darkness of the night.
But the boiling of her magical plants required
a long time, and when it was nearly
ended, the damsel began to weep bitterly;
for she was now so wearied that she
was quite unable to undertake her long
journey homewards. Hereupon the knight
said, ‘Fairest of maidens, you may here rest
securely. I shall watch over you while you
sleep, and awake you at the proper hour.’—Then
he spread out his mantle on the
ground,—collected also a great quantity of
soft moss, making for her a warm and pleasant
couch, and while she looked at it shyly
and timidly, he had already vanished away
into the deepest shades.</p>

<p>“The morning red was already bright in the
east, when she was awoke, terrified by the
distant sounds of martial horns and trumpets;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239"></span>but the young hero again stood near her, and
said, ‘You must now make all possible haste
to reach your home, for the horns that sound
yonder from a distance are the signals of
Hakon Swendson, that now summon your
father to the battle-field. Take up your
golden cup then and follow me.’</p>

<p>“Thereafter, he led the maiden through
many winding and secret paths of the forest,
till she arrived at her father’s castle. Before
taking leave of him there she wished to know
the champion’s name to whom she had been
so much indebted. ‘I am Hakon Swendson,’
answered he, ‘and I know right well
that you are named the beautiful Sigrida,
daughter of the renowned old hero who resides
in this castle. I know too, that the
drink which you have this morning prepared
is intended to work my destruction. But I
have long been your ardent lover, beautiful
Sigrid, and that ancient and deadly feud
between our houses has killed all my hopes.
Therefore I shall now gladly die by your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240"></span>father’s sword, and wish that the drink which
you have brewed from these magical herbs
may render him, as you designed, invincible!’</p>

<p>“Although Hakon Swendson intended after
these words instantly to return to the forest,
the fair Sigrid insisted that he should accompany
her into the castle. There she related
to her father all that had happened to her in
the foregoing night, and with such eloquence,
that the two warriors forgot all their former
wrath against each other. They mutually
threw aside their battle-array, and thereafter
Hakon Swendson and the fair Sigrid were
happily united in marriage.”</p>

<p>The company were well pleased with this
story. The contrast, afforded by the noble
and generous affections which it exemplified,
to the wild and fierce characters of the
northern knights, were compared, by a great
master in the art of painting, (who was among
the guests,) to the effect of a rainbow stretched
across a dark threatening thundercloud;
while the Italian Count preferred the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241"></span>similitude of a rose, which, though not valued
amid the blooming gardens of his native
country, would yet, amid the chill mountains
of the north, be prized as a great treasure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several of the party had turned
their attention on a man of very tall stature,
with a dark sunburnt visage; he was a
Spaniard, by name Don Hernandez; and
they earnestly requested that he would relate
to them some legend from his own romantic
and wonderful country, especially somewhat
of the long and fearful conflicts between the
Christians and Moors. Thereupon he took
up a lute, and began to sing a wild Spanish
ballad, unfolding the tragical fortunes of the
beautiful Donna Clara, and her lover, Don
Gayferos. The first stanzas began in a gay
tone, describing how he had persuaded her to
leave her father’s palace, and take a moonlight
walk with him through the lonely forest.</p>

</div></div>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244"></span></div>
<p>Thus began the Spaniard’s story. Then
he changed the music and measure to a strain
somewhat sad and solemn, describing how,
on the following night, Don Gayferos once
more brought the Lady Clara, by the notes of
a well-known serenade, to the window, and
how she conjured him to say who he was;
above all, whether he were a Spaniard or Moor,
an Infidel or Christian. To this at length he
answers, that he is no Christian, but a
Moorish king, who loves her ardently; who
has great treasures and numberless soldiers;
who would place her with him on his throne,
and entertain her in all regal magnificence,
at his palace of Alhambra, and in the flower-gardens
of Grenada. She leaves her room,
and comes angrily forward on a terrace-walk
of the castle, intending to reproach him;
but he joins her there, and scarcely has she
pronounced a few harsh words ere she falls
fainting into his arms. Thereafter he places
her before him on his horse, and rides rapidly
away through the dark shades of the forest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245"></span></p>
<p>The Spaniard now changed his music once
more into slow melancholy notes, like those of
a church anthem or dirge. He described
how, at the dawn of day, when the ruddy
gleams of the east were on the landscape, the
beautiful Donna Clara knelt on the turf
beside the lifeless frame of her Moorish lover,
who had been attacked in the forest, and
killed by two of her own brothers. With
dishevelled hair, and no longer disguising her
attachment, she weeps over his pale remains.
Looking up to the bright sky, she acknowledges,
that even as the stars rise and set, and
as the eagle hovers up and down, all in this
world is variable and inconstant, only her
affections are unchangeable. Therefore her
brothers built for her, in after times, a lonely
hermitage, with a chapel and an altar, where
she spends her life in weeping and in prayers
for the soul of her departed lover.</p>

<p>The sound of the harp died away in slow
vibrations, and the listeners gazed on each
other in silent melancholy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246"></span></p>
<p>Don Hernandez himself was the first to
break the silence. With graceful and
courteous demeanour, “No doubt,” said he,
“I should both accuse and condemn myself,
noble champions and gentlemen, for
having thus with my mournful songs disturbed
your merriment, had it not been that
you desired to hear a legend from my native
land. In my country, it is true, the people
are serious and solemn of mood; for where
there are such contentions between Moors and
Christians, one’s thoughts must often turn on
melancholy events,—often, for example, on
death.”</p>

<p>“Your story, (song rather I should say,)
requires no such apology,” said the Knight of
Montfaucon. “Can you believe that we also
do not entwine dark-coloured flowers in our
festal garlands? God be praised, Frenchmen
are not yet depraved into such levity, that
we should despise the solemn character of
the Castilian heroes: besides, who is there
among the present company, who would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247"></span>not gladly drink from those deep fountains
of warlike energy and poetic imagination,
which have their source in the rich
warm peninsula of the Pyrenean mountains?”</p>

<p>“You are pleased to speak kindly of us,”
said Don Hernandez; “nor, in some respects,
are we unworthy of your praise.
However, be that as it may, too many dark
flowers must spoil the beauty of the wreath.
A bright lily, or rose, must now and then be
intwined therein; and to such a flower, if I
mistake not, may be compared the story
which now seems hovering on the lips of the
Count de Vinciguerra.”</p>

<p>“Spaniards and Italians should doubtless
assist each other,” replied the Count; “and,
since you desire it, I shall willingly commence
my story:—</p>

<p>“In the fine town of Naples, which, both
on account of its situation and magnificent
buildings, cannot be too much praised, there
lived, some time since, a brave, far-famed,
but already grey-headed warrior, named
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248"></span>Signor Dimetri. After a life spent in toil and
tumult, he wished to enjoy his old age in
luxurious tranquillity, and therefore collected
from different countries all possible rarities and
treasures, his house being filled with the finest
paintings, statues, and tapestry; nor was a
cellar of the most costly wines neglected;
but the rarest of all his possessions was
a most beautiful young wife, descended from
one of the most noble and wealthy families
in Italy. With her, no doubt, he brought
a good share of disquiet and anxiety into his
palace; for, notwithstanding the modesty, the
mild and correct demeanour of the Signora,
yet the old hero was but too conscious of his
grey hairs and want of personal attractions;
so that he had but little respite from the
jealous fantasies by which he was tormented.</p>

<p>“If, in consequence of his marriage, he was
thus disquieted, another inhabitant of Naples
was yet more so. This was the handsome
and accomplished Signor Donatello, a young
nobleman universally admired in the Neapolitan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249"></span>circles, who had chanced to behold
Signora Portia at early mass, (at which time
alone she was allowed to go abroad), and
whose whole thoughts, and even dreams, had,
since that meeting, been engrossed by her
graceful and enchanting figure. Thenceforward
he endeavoured by every means in his
power to draw her attention to himself, resolving,
if he failed in this object, that he
would die for her sake. He did not proceed,
however, like those foolish young men, who
send love-embassies by tattling messengers;
who ride or walk up and down daily before
their mistress’s windows, or send her costly presents;
thus endangering her domestic peace
by rousing the attention of a jealous husband.
Such lovers have themselves to blame, if they
lose all share in those affections which they
are so anxious to gain; but Signor Donatello,
on the contrary, behaved with the
utmost prudence and foresight, taking care,
no doubt, that Madonna Portia should notice
his passion, which even a single look was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250"></span>sufficient to convey; but in such manner, that
she might be convinced her security and
peace were to him infinitely more dear than
the gratification of his own wishes.</p>

<p>“So it happened at last, that she herself
contrived the means of expressing her mutual
affection, and the gratitude she felt
for his prudence and consideration. She
found a trusty messenger to convey several
letters; and all that Donatello had next to
arrange was but to obtain free entrance as a
friend into the house of his beautiful inamorata.
For the future, then, he took advantage
of every occasion to shew the
utmost attention and politeness to the old
Signor Dimetri; and yet so wisely did he
behave, that it was impossible to suspect him
of any particular motives. All seemed but the
effect of accident; yet he had one attribute,
which, though it had aided him more than
all the rest with the fair Portia, yet proved
the greatest possible hindrance to his designs
on her husband. This was his extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251"></span>grace and beauty of person, without which,
being so lively and agreeable a companion, he
would doubtless have been invited long since
into Dimetri’s house; but though he had
given scores of magnificent banquets, to
which the old gentleman was invited, yet
the latter, being determined to avoid all
risks, kept his doors closed, with the utmost
obstinacy, against his courteous entertainer.
In such banquets the young lover had
already spent a considerable share of his fortune,
yet never arrived a single step nearer
the object of his wishes. At length he fixed
his attention on a plan, which he had before
often thought of, though it was then more
like a dream than reality. This was, that he
should contrive to rescue Signor Dimetri from
some great apparent danger, by which exploit
he might infallibly secure his future confidence
and favour. Accordingly he made an
agreement with some hired bravoes, who were
to attack the old hero unawares in a retired
place. As soon, therefore, as Dimetri fell into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252"></span>the snare, Signor Donatello was to rush
out against the assassins, who, after a short
pretended resistance, would give over,
and take to flight. The plot was admirably
carried through. Dimetri was fully persuaded
that his life had been saved by Donatello,
and expressed his gratitude with an air of the
utmost gravity and earnestness. But then,
his doors remained just as firmly locked as
ever; nay, since that adventure, his temper
seemed more peevish and capricious than it
had been before.</p>

<p>“In truth, the old warrior was unable to
disguise from himself, that in regard to his own
person, years, disposition, and manners, he
was by no means fitted to gain or retain the
affections of a young beauty like Madonna
Portia. On the other hand, he strove to encourage
himself by reflecting on his own heroic
achievements, and all that poets have written
on the love and respect cherished by ladies
for warlike valour and renown. Therefore he
did not fail to relate often the history of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253"></span>own exploits in the most brilliant colours
to his young wife; and, moreover, to place
books in her way, in which the same adventures
were fairly recorded. It seemed to him,
however, as if she read these volumes without
any more lively interest than she would
have felt for the wonders told of Hannibal,
Scipio, or any other hero, who had been
mouldering for centuries in the dust. Consequently
he would, notwithstanding the
weakness of his health, have tried to refresh
his withering laurels by some new campaign,
had it not been that his excessive jealousy
would by no means permit him to remain
long absent from his own house. Sometimes,
indeed, he made young spirited horses be
paraded at his castle, and mounted them in
his wife’s presence, or shot at marks with a
cross-bow, which no one but himself could
have bent. Yet he could not help feeling,
that he no longer shone in such exercises as
he had done in his youthful days; while, as to
the anxiety which Madonna Portia expressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254"></span>for him, it was much more like that of a
daughter for the safety of a weak old father,
than of a wife dreading the loss of a beloved
and too venturous husband. How much then
must that inglorious combat with the assassins,
and his rescue out of their hands by
the interference of a handsome youth like
Donatello, have wounded the old warrior’s
pride! From that day he gradually endeavoured
to break off the acquaintance; and as
to inviting the young man to his house, that
was now wholly out of the question.</p>

<p>“After so many disappointments, Donatello
at length lost all patience. With Signor Dimetri
he still kept up an appearance of civility
and friendship; but towards every one
else his temper and behaviour became quite
intolerable, as if, being miserable himself, he
was resolved that all the world should be so
in order to bear him company. Thus it came
to pass, that he, who had been universally
admired and sought after in Naples, was
now shunned and hated even by his most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255"></span>intimate friends; so that two or three
young men, whom he had provoked by
his scornful manners, and also crossed in
some favourite scheme, resolved to waylay
him in the night, and if not to commit
murder, yet at least to wound and beat
him in such manner, that he would be
forced to conduct himself differently for the
future. Accordingly he fell one evening into
the snare that was laid for him; for, as he
could not refrain from walking always after
dark near the house of his beloved Madonna
Portia, it was easy for them to find means
of putting their plans into execution. Notwithstanding
that he made a brave defence,
yet, having been taken unawares, he was unable
to stand against the number of his assailants,
and soon received two severe wounds.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the old warrior heard the clashing
of arms and loud voices on the street;
and being determined not to lose such an opportunity
of playing the part of an Orlando
before his beautiful lady, he girded on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256"></span>belt, and brandishing his great battle-sword,
rushed out of the house. Perhaps, being thus
prepared and resolute, he proved a powerful
assailant, or perhaps mere terror at such a
frightful figure got the better of Donatello’s
youthful adversaries. Suffice it to say, they
fled immediately, and he was set at liberty.
Thereupon the triumphant victor forgot all at
once his former doubts and fears. He directly
brought in his rescued friend as a trophy
into the presence of Signora Portia, insisting,
moreover, that a room should be provided
for him, and that she should herself undertake
the cure of his wounds. As Donatello
was far too prudent, in Signor Dimetri’s presence,
to speak on any other subject but the
wonderful prowess and courage of his deliverer,
describing how he had by his single arm put to
flight a whole troop of banditti, all suspicions
were lulled to sleep. Moreover, he continued
to talk with such eloquence of the old hero’s
former exploits, and numberless adventures
by sea and land, that, after his recovery, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257"></span>lived still as an intimate and chosen friend in
Dimetri’s palace. The latter found him
oftentimes alone with his wife; but then he
was always speaking or reading of the same
heroic achievements, to which the lady now
seemed to listen with the greatest attention.</p>

<p>“From this story we may learn, that all
our best-laid plans to gain the confidence of
another may prove unsuccessful, and that it
is not always by conferring favours that one
can excite his good-will. On the other hand,
as soon as his own vanity is inlisted on our
side, we have no farther trouble, but the
game of itself will be won.”</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto challenged the Knight of Montfaucon.
</p>


<p>Many opinions were immediately offered on
this story of the old warrior and young lover.
Some praised the prudence and reserve of
Donatello; others extolled the quick-sightedness
of Signora Portia, for having understood
the wishes and motives of such a silent lover;
while it was agreed on all sides that the persons
in the drama were to be looked on as
equally fortunate, Signor Dimetri not excepted,
since he, like the rest, had obtained at
last the object which he had so long wished for.</p>

<p>During this discourse, the kind and hospitable
Sir Folko de Montfaucon was looking
eagerly round the table, watching whether
his guests were well supplied with wine and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259"></span>satisfied with their entertainment. It now
seemed to him as if Sir Otto von Trautwangen
sat lost in thoughts, which, from the expression
of his features, could not be either cheerful
or agreeable. Wishing to rouse him
from this trance, Sir Folko observed, “My
noble guest from Germany has heard all the
remarks which have been made on the Count’s
narrative, but has not himself uttered one word.
May it please you, sir, to say which of these
characters seems to you the most praiseworthy
and enviable? Whether do you like
best the young lady or the knight?”</p>

<p>With his eyes darkly gleaming, and in a
deep severe tone, which contrasted strangely
with the mirthful levity of the party, Sir
Otto replied, “I am indeed unable to perceive
how the most ingenious listener could
find aught to approve in the character or
conduct of such a knight or lady. If you
had inquired of me which of the two was the
more base, abominable, devilish, and depraved,
I might indeed have more readily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260"></span>provided myself with an answer, although
even then the choice would have been difficult.
Fy on it! That renowned warrior had raised
up a vain coquette to a situation such as she
never deserved, had shared with her his
house and fortune, placed his honour and
happiness in her hands, hoping that the late
evening of his life might still be cheered
by gleams of confidence, fidelity, and love!
Then, lo! the wretched creature forfeits
all the reward and praise which she might
have obtained for virtue and dignified demeanour,
by encouraging a libertine paramour!
Shame, shame! That idle and despicable
young fellow, who, for himself, would
never have won any wreath of fame, had
succeeded in gaining the friendly notice and
society of a renowned hero, at which any
generous and honest heart would have been
proud and rejoiced; and this friendship he
only uses for his own base purposes, in order
to lay his snares with more effect. Then
he hires, forsooth, bravoes and assassins;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261"></span>wherefore should he not as well have tried
poison? At last the brave old man performs
that exploit in earnest, of which he had made
a base and cowardly pretence; uses, perhaps
for the last time, his already honoured
and victorious sword in the service of that
deceitful poltron, who, instead of sinking into
the earth with shame——but forgive me,
noble sir, I have not temper nor patience to
speak farther, and have already dwelt too
long on a subject so hateful!”</p>

<p>Every one in the banquet-hall was now
silent, and on every cheek glowed a deep blush
of self-reproach, from which even the count
Alessandro de Vinciguerra was not exempted.
He said, however,—“This noble stranger
has judged the characters of my story rather
too severely. In the light in which he has
placed them, they may indeed deserve all the
censure which he has so freely bestowed; but
in our glowing climate beyond the Alps, the
inhabitants, both men and women, are, by
nature, differently framed and disposed from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262"></span>the quiet people of his cold native land;
and, methinks, the same moderation and virtue
cannot be demanded of us.” “This
were to affirm then,” said Sir Otto, “that
right and wrong depended on the nearness or
distance of the sun; but I well know, that the
inhabitants beyond the Alps would as unwillingly
incur the risk of eternal malediction as
those of any other country; and that the
road which your story instructs us to travel
leads but to the realms of the devil there
cannot be any doubt.”</p>

<p>The simple and child-like energy, the tranquil
consciousness of right, which were visible
on Sir Otto’s countenance when he spoke
these words, reminded one of the angels’
heads carved in marble by the old devout
artists of Germany or Italy. An involuntary
emotion of awe, an influence, breathed as it
were from the regions of eternal life, was felt
through all the party there assembled; so that
even the proud and gay Count de Vinciguerra
could not lift his eyes from the ground. Don
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263"></span>Hernandez meanwhile had risen from his
chair, and gone round, unperceived, behind
Sir Otto. He touched him on the shoulder,
and, looking back, the youth saw the kindly
countenance and dark eyes of the Castilian
gleaming on him with an expression of
triumph and approbation.</p>

<p>After a long silence, the Chevalier de
Montfaucon also rose, and addressed himself
to the German youth: “Sir Knight,” said
he, “you have indeed made us all heartily
ashamed, and therefore merit our gratitude
and praise; for the very tones of your voice
sounded on our ears like the silvery music of
a chapel-bell, warning us to self-reproval, to
humility, and devotion. Accept, therefore,
my sincerest thanks, and believe me, that I
rejoice in possessing, even for a short space,
such a jewel and mirror of knighthood within
my castle.” Thereupon he made to Sir Otto
a low and solemn obeisance. All the knights
and other guests rose at the same time, and
followed his example.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264"></span></p>
<p>Sir Otto was confused, and blushed deeply.
“Noble sirs,” said he, “I believe that you
pay this homage to Heaven only, to whose
mandates I have chanced to direct your attention.
Were it otherwise, a humble and inexperienced
youth, such as I am, would indeed
ill deserve such honour.”</p>

<p>“Valiant stranger,” answered the Knight
of Montfaucon, “we are unwilling to allow
that you should speak of yourself so unjustly.
May we beg to know your name, and, if it so
please you, to hear the story of your past
life?”</p>

<p>“Should I ever have a story worth relating,”
answered Sir Otto, “and what the
story may be, will depend on your renowned
and victorious arm, Sir Knight of Montfaucon.
Can you still remember the young
squire on the banks of the Danube, who was
present during that eventful evening, when
you so gloriously overcame the powerful
Count Archimbald of Waldeck? I wear now
the golden spurs; nor have the three strokes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265"></span>of a knightly sword on my shoulders, nor
a moonlight watch, been forgotten.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well, Sir Knight,” answered the
Chevalier; “and you are now perchance in
quest of Gabrielle’s ring?” With a courteous
bow, Sir Otto replied in the affirmative.
“I am then at your command,” answered Sir
Folko; and, turning to the company, he
added, “This brave young knight has indeed
not related any adventure for your entertainment;
but, to compensate for his silence, you
may be eye-witnesses of one to-morrow, if you
will do me the honour to accompany me to
another of my castles in Normandy, where he
will engage with me in the lists, and whither
I shall invite also the beautiful Gabrielle de
Portamour to behold our encounter.” Thereafter
he explained to them how he had before
now met with Sir Otto near the fortress of
Trautwangen, and contended there with the
Count Archimbald von Waldeck for the ring.
Also, how the castle to which he would invite
the Lady Gabrielle was the principal mansion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266"></span>on those territories of which the ring gave
the exclusive right of possession; so that she
would doubtless not fail to honour them with
her company. All the guests now present
accepted the invitation; and Sir Otto, with
downcast eyes, thanked them for their great
courtesy, in as much as they would condescend
to behold how a youth, hitherto so
humble and unpractised in arms, was to
be admitted to the honour of a combat with
the renowned Sir Folko de Montfaucon.
Every heart was prepossessed in his favour;
and even the Count Alessandro de Vinciguerra
embraced him cordially, saying,
“Truly, since the fates were resolved, that,
for the chastisement of my sinful levity, I
should be visited by a severe moralist and
stern preacher, there could not have been
found one in all the world to whom I should
have listened so willingly as to him who is
now among us.”</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto heard from the Chevalier de Montfaucon, a<br>
Story of the Ring.
</p>


<p>With the first sun-rays of the following
morning, all those valiant knights and other
guests had arisen, and departed on their way
to Normandy. It was a pleasure to look on
them as they proceeded on their journey, now
half lost amid the shadowy copsewoods, then
breaking out again along the bright green
meadows; poets and painters, renowned in
their several arts, mingling in groupes, with
warriors and their squires in bright-gleaming
armour, attended too by sumpter-horses in
rich coverings fringed with gold and silver.
Among the most brilliant figures was that
of the Count Alessandro de Vinciguerra,
wearing a great cloak embroidered with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268"></span>arms of his family, which waved and fluttered
in the wind. His garments, too, glittered
in the sunlight, and feathers of all colours
in a vast plume surmounted his barett.
He had laid aside his coat of mail, wearing
only a travelling dress, and riding on a stately
mule, richly caparisoned, with no other
weapons but a sword and a small glancing
buckler, both of which hung from his
blue velvet saddle. Not far distant, however,
was a squire, who led by the golden
reins his war-steed, prancing and snorting,
and there was also a sumpter-horse, bearing
his massive armour, surmounted by the close
head-piece, with nodding plumes of heron’s
feathers, all arranged as if it had been to
make up a subject for the painter. The
brave Chevalier de Montfaucon and the
young Knight of Trautwangen rode for the
most part together, deeply engrossed in their
discourse, and always feeling more and more
friendship for each other. In like manner,
also, Sir Otto’s light-brown steed and De
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269"></span>Montfaucon’s silver-grey seemed to acquire
mutual good-will and attachment, notwithstanding
the hatred which the former used to
entertain towards all strangers. Of the conversation
which passed between the knights
it may be allowed us here to divulge what
follows:—</p>

<p>“I had at length almost despaired of finding
you in France,” said Sir Otto. “At the
holy sepulchre rather, I thought we should
meet one day, or perhaps on the road thither.
For are not all the noblest hearts in Europe
now attracted to that sacred monument, which,
environed and profaned by Saracens with
their heathenish abominations, draws, like an
irresistible magnet, the processions of pilgrims
and warriors from all quarters to effect its
liberation? Your heart too, my noble adversary,
doubtless beats in unison with these
devout feelings. Wherefore then do I not
behold the cross on your shoulders?”</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Sir Folko, “it is
not for the holy war only that soldiers are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270"></span>required. Our king demands the services of
his barons for the protection of our own
blooming land. He indeed is himself gone to
the crusades, and for that reason has enjoined
me and others of my rank to remain at home,
in order to guard the terrestrial paradise of
France until his return from Palestine. The
Moors of Spain are here not so far remote
that we can feel in security, nor are we divided
from them by any arm of the sea. If
the valiant champions of Castile do their utmost
to keep off those assailants, we too must
lend our aid to that brave nation, or appear
even in our own estimation like abject cowards.
I think, in the next place, to ride into Spain,
in company with the valiant Don Hernandez,
and perhaps also with you, provided I should
fall, and yet survive our combat; for in that
event you are doubtless aware that you become
a vassal of France.” Otto looked at him inquiringly,
and the chevalier continued:—“I
thought you must have known that the beautiful
Gabrielle has promised to bestow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271"></span>herself, as well as all her possessions, on the
knight who is so fortunate as to win back
her ring. How your eyes now gleam with
hope and anticipated triumph!” In truth, Sir
Otto’s whole mind was lighted up by a joy
such as he had never before felt; and yet,
when he had time for reflection, he could
not help being more than ever agitated by
doubts, whether he should win the victory,—or
(so overpowering was his emotion) whether
he should even live to see the day when he might
try his fortune in a combat so glorious. Sir
Folko meanwhile seemed delighted by the
mood of mind into which he had brought his
companion; and then, after a space, he looked
on him with a changed and melancholy aspect,
perchance, because he remembered that Sir
Otto’s courage and joy of heart might lead
him on to destruction, dealt out by that arm
which had already sent so many adversaries
to the grave. Thereafter both of them endeavoured,
by a change of discourse, to forget
mutually, that they were shortly to engage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272"></span>with each other in a mortal combat. Among
various questions, Sir Otto inquired of De
Montfaucon, what he had actually learned of
the Magic Ring’s wonderful history and virtues;
whereupon the chevalier answered him
as follows:—</p>

<p>“The ring is an inheritance derived from
my stepfather, a renowned and valiant hero,
by name Sir Huguenin, and who was held
in high honour at our king’s court. Although
he had come as a stranger into the land,
some said from the East, and others from the
North, yet he had obtained, as a reward for
his brave exploits, great feudal territories;
over which his right of disposal was so unlimited,
that he could leave them to whomsoever
he pleased, whether lady or knight.
Appearing with great splendour at all the
court-festivals, he had fallen in love with a
beautiful damsel, descended from one of the
first houses in France; they were regularly
betrothed, and, among other gifts, he had
promised her a wonderful ring, possessed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273"></span>many magical virtues, which it was said that
he had brought with him from distant realms
of the North. This ring was also to serve his
bride for a pledge, that the feudal tenures in
France were to be hers; and it was affirmed,
that the lady had even appeared with it on
her finger at grand festivals; yet it always
returned again into the possession of Sir
Huguenin.</p>

<p>“About that time he travelled into Normandy,
in order to survey his beautiful
estates, some of which lay close to our
family mansion, where my mother was living
in seclusion, zealously occupied in the education
of her son, so that he might become a
brave knight, not unworthy of the name of
Montfaucon. In her retirement, however,
she was often disturbed, on account of her extraordinary
and all-surpassing beauty, by the
visits of numberless admirers, whose presence
was in her estimation always troublesome and
unwelcome. I can yet well recollect, how the
brilliant Sir Huguenin came for the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274"></span>time on horseback to our castle,—how my
whole heart was won, by his fine figure and
courteous demeanour, as he spoke with my
mother; for I was then a boy ten years of
age, and could well distinguish the difference
between him and our other neighbours. If
since then I have been fortunate enough to
win the smiles of many noble ladies, I must
say that I owe that distinction to the lessons
and example which I received from Sir
Huguenin, though I have never equalled that
model of all noble and warlike accomplishments
which was then set before me. On
my mother too his appearance and conduct
made a deep impression; while he, on the
other hand, was so struck with her unrivalled
beauty, that the thoughts of a marriage with
any one else became insupportable. Henceforth
his first care was to make himself free
from his former engagements, and though
the relations of the damsel to whom he had
been betrothed were vehemently enraged, yet
such was the terror they entertained of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275"></span>renowned Sir Huguenin, more especially because
he was the king’s chosen favourite, that
the transaction was carried through without
a murmur. The knight retained possession
of his ring, and it was not till long after her
marriage that my mother knew of the vows
that for her sake had thus been broken.</p>

<p>“Willingly and confidently, therefore, had
the beautiful widow resigned her person and
fortune; and what was yet nearer and dearer
to her heart,—the education of her son,—into
the hands of the far-famed Sir Huguenin.
In what degree he might have valued the
possessions thus bestowed on him I know not;
for the season of love, with its sunbeams and
roses, was for them of brief duration. For a
space of about two years, within which time
my step-sister, Blanchefleur, a living picture
of her beautiful mother, came into the world,
Sir Huguenin lived in our castle; then he
went out across the seas, and never more
returned. For his fame, and his soul’s sake,
we hope that a sudden and honourable death
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276"></span>had somewhere overtaken him. My mother
never heard of him again; and the more that
her happiness had been increased during the
short time of their union, the more resolutely
she now devoted herself to penance and seclusion.
For a few years grief preyed unceasingly
on her frame; and at length, with
a smile of melancholy resignation, she sank
into the now welcome grave.</p>

<p>“As to that other duty, the care of my
youthful education, which she had confided to
him, it was, in truth, amply fulfilled. Grave,
yet affectionate,—dignified, yet kind, like a
guiding pillar of light, his image, even at this
hour, always moves before me. Through
the day he spoke with me indeed but little,
but afforded me the most admirable example
in the use of arms, in hunting, and in horsemanship.
In the evenings he became eloquent,
and proudly related to me many wondrous
legends of the olden times. Little or no
admonishment accompanied these stories; but
they were told in such manner, that every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277"></span>glorious adventure came before my sight with
all the force of reality, and my heart was
filled with irresistible longing to obtain the
brilliant honours of knighthood. This desire
became the more passionate, when I reflected,
that he, from whose lips I heard all those
marvellous tales was himself a renowned
hero, whose invincible arm had doubtless performed
achievements equal to those which
he described of others. Without boasting, I
may truly say, that through those two years
I proved myself no undeserving scholar; on
which account he treated me with great kindness;
and on the night before his departure,
he led me into his chamber, shut the door,
and said,—‘Folko, I am now going hence
on a campaign;—how long I shall remain
absent, Heaven knows,—perhaps it may be
for ever! In your eyes I can already read
the request that you would prefer, for my
permission that you should accompany me
to the battle-field; but that may not be;
you must continue here to be the protector
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278"></span>of your mother and the little Blanchefleur;
for although you are now only in your thirteenth
summer, yet, both from your prudence
and skill in the use of arms, you might be
counted full six years older. It shall be your
duty, therefore, to protect your sister in the
undisturbed possession of a wonderful ring,
which I shall now leave in her hands;
but of which, as I am well aware, many
claimants will henceforth appear, wishing to
deprive her of that valuable gift. But mark
you, young lion of Montfaucon, let them not
succeed in such attempts; and be it your care
also, that, when at last you are both grown to
man and woman’s estate, the Lady Blanchefleur
shall bear the name of your house; for
mine, though it is renowned and honourable,
is yet less known here, and sounds strange to
the inhabitants of Normandy. Wilt thou
now promise to remember these injunctions?’
Proudly, and rejoiced in heart, I agreed to all
that he desired; and, with God’s help, have
been true to my word, even to the present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279"></span>day. The damsel, who had been betrothed
formerly to Sir Huguenin, married afterwards
the Knight of Portamour, and became
the mother of Gabrielle. Thereafter the
beautiful Gabrielle, who, in early youth, was
left an orphan, heard from her guardians
many stories of the Magic Ring, and how
it should by right have been in her possession,
in as much as her mother, in her dying
moments, had called for it, as for some dear
and precious gift, which, by solemn vows, had
become hers. Thence arose the many conflicts
for this mysterious gem. Perhaps, if it
is the will of Heaven, and you are fortunate,
these disputes may, to-day or to-morrow, be
brought to an end; for, behold the towers of
the Norman castle, to which I have invited my
beautiful adversary, are now visible over the
trees!”</p>

How the Knights arrived at the Castle of Sir Folko de<br>
Montfaucon.
</p>


<p>Amid a green forest, below the heights of the
castle, the party had made a halt under the
verdant canopy of the beech-trees, in order to
enjoy in quiet the cool pleasant air of an
autumnal evening, while a courier went before
in order to announce the coming of
his master and the numerous party of noble
guests at the fortress. But scarcely had
they dismounted, and begun to pass round
the wine-cup, replenished from the sumpter-horses,
when the courier returned hastily,
announcing, that the Lady Gabrielle de
Portamour had already arrived; and, at
her desire, the Lady Blanchefleur de Montfaucon
had commanded, that an evening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281"></span>banquet should be provided under the green
shades of the forest; also, that a procession,
led by the two noble damsels, was now descending
from the castle. In truth, the
knights already saw through the trees the
gleam of armour and weapons, the gold and
silver vessels for the banquet, and the bright
embroidery of festal garments. The Knight
of Montfaucon now turned to Don Hernandez
and the Count de Vinciguerra,
begging, that for a short interval they would
take their places in the van of the party, in
order to receive the ladies; “for,” added he,
“it is proper that we two combatants should
make our appearance before the beautiful
Gabrielle, in a guise more fitting than that
which our rapid journey and this sudden
visit has for the moment left within our
power.” With these words he went along
with Sir Otto into a dense thicket of the
valley, whither they were followed by Theobaldo
and another squire.</p>

<p>Earnestly, and in great haste, the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282"></span>young champions prepared for their martial
toilette. Their cuirasses and greaves
were carefully rubbed and burnished, the
leather straps drawn tighter, and the ends
plaited up; their helmet-plumes arranged,
and their sashes taken off, in order that they
might be cleared from dust, and replaced in a
fashion more becoming. At the moment
when both were adjusting their helmets, Sir
Folko looked steadfastly at his young adversary.
“Now,” said he, “when you draw
down your eagle’s visor, I can explain to
myself clearly the dim recollections, which
were awoke by the black armour inlaid with
silver. Is it not in truth the same coat of mail
that was heretofore worn by Count
Archimbald von Waldeck?” Sir Otto having
answered in the affirmative, he continued,
“I shall at some time or another beg of
you to relate to me how one so young as
you are,—but a mere spring-blossom of
knighthood,—could have cased himself in
armour such as this. On the other hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283"></span>I shall describe to you the many strange
dreams by which I have been visited, of
desperate conflicts with a black and white
eagle, which methought always flew across
the Rhine from Germany hither; that it sat
upon my head, and, with its powerful hooked
bill, plucked at a wreath of flowers which was
wound around my temples. When I awoke
from this dream, I used to say to myself,
‘Thou thinkest doubtless of battles that may
yet take place with the valiant Sir Archimbald
von Waldeck. But this may not be.
He is bound by the conditions of our former
encounter, and may never more claim this
ring; yet the eagle is once more prepared for
battle before me!’ Come then, brave young
Knight of Trautwangen. The ladies await
us.” Thereupon the two warriors went together,
hand in hand, to join the noble
company.</p>

<p>Amid that circle of fair damsels, valiant
champions, and skilful artists, Gabrielle’s
beauty shone so pre-eminent, that Sir Otto,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284"></span>conscious as he was of the decisive combat
and glorious prize that awaited him, was dazzled,
and fixed his eyes humbly on the
ground. Sir Folko, on the other hand, went
up to the lady, and said, “Never, methinks,
should I forgive my own seeming discourtesy,
in thus arriving later than a guest so noble and
so lovely, were it not that it is yet undetermined
which will at last be the guest, and
which the stranger in these domains. If it
so please you, this brave young German is
now ready to fix on the conditions of our
combat.”</p>

<p>Gabrielle threw an inquiring look on Sir
Otto. It seemed as if she doubted if his
youth and inexperience admitted of such an
encounter; then again, by the changed expression
of her features, one could read the
return of confidence, as if one so young and
simple-hearted were sent like a guardian
angel for her defence. “Are you not the
youth,” said she, “with whom I once spoke
on the banks of the Danube?” “Truly I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285"></span>the same,” replied Sir Otto in a low voice;
“and now stand here in order to redeem the
pledge which I then called Heaven to witness.”
Gabrielle looked on him kindly, yet
it seemed as if she once more began to doubt
and hesitate. The Knight of Montfaucon again
interposed, saying, “Lady, will you then
choose this noble youth for your champion?
It is not my custom to propose an encounter
with a young and powerless adversary, but
with this knight I should willingly enter the
lists.” Thereafter the Lady Gabrielle gracefully
pulled off her glove from her snow-white
hand, and tied it firmly to Sir Otto’s
sash. “Thus,” said she, “on your sword
I bind my hopes and the just rights of my
inheritance!” then, in a low, half-audible
tone, she added, “and Gabrielle will be
the reward of the victor.” He thought
of returning some answer, when near him
he heard the murmuring tones of another
voice, low, and yet ardent, like the
melodious cooing of a turtle-dove. Looking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286"></span>up he beheld a form of the most exquisite
grace leaning over the shoulder of Sir Folko,
a form in which, from the descriptions which
he had heard, he immediately recognised the
Lady Blanchefleur; so that he could now well
believe all that the knight had narrated to
him of his mother’s matchless and imperishable
beauty. In spite of death and the grave
the same charms were thus renewed once
more, living and smiling on the world.
Blanchefleur now bent her head humbly
towards Gabrielle, and whispered,—“I have
but one dearly-loved brother, and must he thus,
even to the very end of his life, be engaged
in strife and contention, all for the sake of
that trifling ring? Shall I never be enabled to
call him with certainty my own? Rather,
noble lady, let the present battle be decisive,
so that the question may be for ever set at
rest; and, if my brother falls, then the ring is
yours. On the contrary, should your champion
be unfortunate, let all pretensions to the
ring be given up on your part; only let this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287"></span>contest be final. Pray you, listen to this request,
for you have too much generosity to wish
that this unequal contest should be kept up any
longer!” It was obvious to the by-standers,
that Gabrielle now underwent a conflict with
her own emotions. At last she looked up
kindly, and said,—“Let it be so!” Then,
turning to Sir Otto of Trautwangen, she
added, with a mixture of fear and dignity
of manner, “Sir Knight, my whole weal and
woe are intrusted in your hands; and on
your valour and generosity I have the fullest
reliance.” “May we not then directly enter
the lists, even within this very hour?” inquired
Sir Otto anxiously, and with the
fervour of inspiration. “Not so,” said
Gabrielle gravely; “I have not forgotten the
armour which you now wear; and perhaps it
may be destined to make good on this occasion
the disgrace which it sustained in the
former encounter; or, perhaps, by new misfortune,
to complete the measure of my distresses.
But as on that fatal night I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288"></span>anxious and impatient for the combat, for
the present, I am, on the contrary, determined
to practise self-control. To-morrow,
therefore, you shall enter the lists at mid-day,
in the great square of the castle. Till that
hour, let us speak no more of the disputes
which have led to this meeting; but rather
(if it be allowed me to make one more request)
let the time be spent in unrestrained
mirth and jollity.”</p>

<p>Sir Folko made a low obeisance, and in a
few minutes contrived that his party were all
elegantly and luxuriously placed beneath the
green arcades of the beech-wood. Thereafter
sparkling wine and the richest viands were
handed round among the guests. This led to
much gay and convivial talk; at length also
to songs and music, to which various individuals
contributed, every one as he was best
able. Of a sudden, an earnest request was
suggested, and passed from one to another,
that the Lady Blanchefleur would sing the
tragical fortunes of Heloise and Abelard, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289"></span>some of the noble masters of minstrelsy, who
were there present. For this purpose she
sought out a young man from her brother’s
train, who was named Master Aleard, and
thereafter they began together a ballad, in
alternate parts, on the story of these unfortunate
lovers, and sang so sweet and mournfully,
that when they had concluded, tears
gleamed in many a beautiful eye, and even
the boldest warriors were moved. Otto felt
the sounds reverberate even to his inmost
heart; it seemed to him almost as if the whole
ballad had been made upon his own fortunes,
little as such a melancholy legend was suited
to his present condition; and he could not help
repeating to himself, in a low voice, some of
the concluding stanzas. Meanwhile Sir Folko
de Montfaucon looked gloomily on the
ground, with an expression contrasting
strangely with his usual demeanour. At last
he cast a stern angry glance at the Lady
Blanchefleur, who was then speaking earnestly
with the minstrel Aleard; whereupon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290"></span>she arose, and came hastily to her brother,
taking her place beside him, which she did
not quit again through the evening. As if
now well satisfied with her conduct, Sir Folko
devoted almost his whole attention to her,
contriving a thousand agreeable stories for
her entertainment. It seemed, however, now
and then, as if tears glittered in the beautiful
mild eyes of the damsel; and the young
Master Aleard retired, thoughtful and disconsolate
into the deep thickets of the forest.
The cool evening now settled on the woods.
From the ground, densely strewed with fallen
beech-leaves, there arose damp vapours, and
the party at length quitted their places, and
proceeded, keeping time to mirthful music,
up the castle hill. During their march, it
was a pleasure to see how the light of their
torches and lamps gleamed along the rocky
paths through the shades of the now descending
night.</p>

<p class="center">
How Sir Otto vanquished the Knight of Montfaucon.
</p>


<p>On the morning of the following day, at an
early hour, there arose great tumult and
bustle in the spacious court of the castle,
which was covered with green turf, and
planted on all sides with rows of tall lime-trees.
There were posts driven into the
ground, and rails laid upon them, as a grating,
which should keep the by-standers at a
proper distance, and this grating was also
hung with embroidered drapery. Within
the lists there were brought carts full of
dry white sand, which the squires spread
carefully over the turf, so that both man
and horse might have firmer footing thereon,
than the slippery grass would have afforded.
Meanwhile, Don Hernandez and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292"></span>the Count de Vinciguerra were seen hastening
hither and thither, giving orders, and attending
to all the preparations; for, on the preceding
evening, it had been agreed that they
were to act as umpires and seconds at the
combat. After mature deliberation, they laid
down the exact dimensions for the lists, and
tried how both champions might be placed
with equal advantages of wind and sunlight.
For the ladies they had erected a grand stage
among the branches of the lime-trees; so that,
sitting therein, they were at once shaded and
protected, yet at the same time had a free
view of the battle-field. A multitude of
spectators had already collected, waiting with
impatience for the knights and ladies, who
were to play the principal parts at this tragic
festival.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de Montfaucon and the
Knight of Trautwangen meanwhile donned
their armour in separate chambers. In the
service of the latter, his friend Theobaldo was
this day more zealous than ever, evincing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293"></span>degree of anxiety and tenderness which was
to him quite unusual. From the eagle-helmet
down to the golden spurs, he examined
minutely every plate, belt, and buckle, now
drawing them tight, now loosening them
again, and yet never found his arrangements
good enough for his master and friend. Sir
Otto looked at him kindly, and said, “How
is this, Theobaldo? You seem as melancholy
and anxious, as if you were arming me for the
last time!” “That may indeed be so,” answered
the merchant; “sad feelings and sad
words often turn into true prophecies!”
Then, deeply moved, he bent his head over
the knight’s yet unarmed right hand.</p>

<p>The door now opened suddenly, and in his
armour of blue and gold, gleaming like the
vault of heaven in a starry night, appeared
at it Sir Folko de Montfaucon. He wore
his golden helmet with the visor still open
and a squire followed bearing his great battle-sword.
“Dear brother,” said he to Sir Otto,
“we have spent the time like good friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294"></span>together up to this day, and interchanged
many kind looks. Now, however, it may
come to pass, that after we have drawn down
our visors, we shall never behold each other
again. Therefore have I come to you at
this time, that I may once more heartily embrace
you; and that, ere our meeting in the
lists, we may pray together in the chapel before
the altar.” Therewith he spread his
arms, into which Sir Otto threw himself, and
the two champions embraced with such fervour,
as if the warmth of their friendship
could have melted the cold iron with which
they were covered. Then a trumpet sounded
from the court, and they broke asunder
suddenly. “It is the first signal,” said Sir
Folko. “My noble adversary will now, if
it so please him, gird on my sword, and I shall
render him the like service.” This was accordingly
done; and, as the massive glittering
weapons were adjusted, they related on both
sides by whom these swords had been presented
to them, Sir Folko’s being the gift of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295"></span>stepfather, Sir Huguenin, and that of Sir
Otto, as we have already told, being received
from his father, Sir Hugh von Trautwangen.
Thereafter they went arm in arm down to the
chapel, where they kneeled together, one on
each side of the altar, and remained there in
silent prayer, until the trumpets sounded
another signal. Then rising up, they looked
once more with great kindness on each other,
drew down their visors, and came forth into
the castle-court, which was now brightly illumined
by the sunbeams.</p>

<p>The ladies were already seated in their
balcony, amid the foliage of the lime-trees;
and Sir Folko said to his companion, “In
those northern realms, from which our family
is sprung, we have an old legend touching the
golden apples of immortality. Brother, do
you mark them yonder, among the branches,
above us?” These words he had intended
to be playful and light-hearted; but uttered,
as they were, from behind the cold
motionless visor, unaided by a smile or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296"></span>lively glance, hollow too and suppressed in
tone, they sounded rather like a mournful
forewarning of death. The knights now
shook hands before the assembled spectators,
and went severally to mount their horses.
As Sir Folko, on the left of the balcony, approached
his silver-grey charger, his noble
falcon, which had now almost recovered from
the wound inflicted by Theobaldo, flew down
from a window of the castle, and took his
place on the knight’s helmet, which he would
not leave till he was taken thence by his
master’s hand. The latter then stroked him
kindly on the neck, and, pulling down the
hood over the faithful creature’s eyes, gave
him in charge to one of his squires, who
carried him away. A deep-sounding murmur
then arose through the multitude; by
some it was interpreted as a sure anticipation
of victory for Sir Folko; while others thought
that the poor bird wished to take his last
farewell, and that his master would of necessity
die. Then, for the third time, the herald
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297"></span>sounded his trumpet; all voices were hushed;
and now, mounted on their war-steeds, the
two champions came from opposite sides into
their proper places.</p>

<p>Thereafter, underneath the balcony where
the ladies sat, arose Don Hernandez, in magnificent
armour, with his visor open; he called
aloud, “Be it known to all knights and ladies,
also to others of whatsoever degree, who are
here present, that my friend, the Count
Alessandro de Vinciguerra, who is now beside
me, holds in his hands a gold casket, with the
ring, which is to be the prize of this combat.
The champions have the free right of contending
with lances and with swords, on
horseback, or on foot. Whosoever of the
twain shall be able courteously to approach
the Count of Vinciguerra, take the casket
from his hands, bring it to the Lady
Gabrielle in the balcony, and place the ring
on her finger, without interruption from his
adversary, shall be looked upon as the victor,
and all contentions for this cause are from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298"></span>henceforth at an end. Noble champions, are
these conditions understood and approved?”</p>

<p>Both knights thereupon inclined their heads,
with their long waving plumes, in token of
consent; and Hernandez, with grave dignity,
took his place again beside the Count. A
deep stillness prevailed through the assembly,
yet it lasted but for a moment; for there was
heard from all sides a great flourish of trumpets;
the spectators all trembled, and both
knights urged forward their foaming highspirited
horses. In the middle of the battle-field,
they struck together with such a
frightful clash, that the noise even overpowered
that of the trumpets, and, like
two gigantic statues, the silver-grey and
the light-brown charger stood opposite to
each other, both on their hind-legs, and pawing
in the air with their fore-hoofs, in order
to regain their equipoise after that terrible
shock, by which the lances on both sides had
been shivered in pieces, and strewed over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299"></span>battle-ground. The riders sat firmly, both
leaning forwards, and spurring their horses;
but, after a brief space of uncertain motion,
both of them, being unable to regain their proper
position, fell backwards with a great crash
upon the sand.</p>

<p>A cry of horror now sounded from the
balcony, and was echoed by all the spectators.
But ere the cry had ceased, and before
the horses had risen from the ground, both
knights had disengaged themselves, and ran
with swords drawn towards the place where
the Count Alessandro de Vinciguerra was
stationed with the ring. Each perceiving,
however, that his opponent was ready to prevent
him from obtaining it, they stood looking
for a space at each other, then grasped
their swords firmly, and went, with measured
steps, back to the place where they had fallen,
and where their shields yet lay upon the
ground. At the same moment each had
seized on his glittering targe; while their
horses, having now raised themselves up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300"></span>watchfully followed every movement. It
was mournful, however, to behold how Sir
Folko’s silver-grey charger, severely wounded
on the shoulder, struggled vainly with his
lameness; snorting and neighing as he had
done at the commencement of the battle,
and thus proving, that though his activity
were lost, he retained yet all his courage
and attachment. Observing this, Sir Otto,
who would by no means take advantage
of his adversary, said, with a look of compassion
for the poor steed,—“Noble Sir, shall
we not rather desire our horses to be led
away?” With a courteous and thankful salutation,
Sir Folko replied,—“Be it according
to your pleasure. Your conduct here is indeed
such as from the beginning I had expected
of you.” So the horses were led out
of the lists.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the knights, with their
raised shields and gleaming swords, come up
against each other; scarcely had their first
blows sounded on their armour, when, behold!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301"></span>Sir Otto’s light-brown steed, which, in spite of
their utmost efforts, had broken from the
squires, sprung over the rails, and would
have immediately attacked his master’s opponent.
Sir Otto, however, seized him by the
bridle, and led him back to the gateway of
the lists, giving him again in charge to the
squires, while, with threatening gestures and
a stern voice, he commanded him to stand
quiet; so that the noble steed remained motionless,
nor did the by-standers even require
the reins to hold him.</p>

<p>On Sir Otto’s return, the Chevalier de
Montfaucon made him a kind and courteous
salutation with his sword; then raised it
for a vehement attack, and the frightful combat
began anew. Ere long, the blows on
both sides fell thick as hail, till oftentimes
the combatants stood with their shields pressed
together, watching their opportunity to
strike, and then again flew suddenly asunder.
At length Sir Folko’s sword descended, with
the rapidity of lightning, on his opponent’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302"></span>left arm, in such manner, that his shield was
cleft in twain, and one half fell rattling on the
ground. “Hold, hold!” cried the chevalier;
and Sir Otto lowered his weapon, which he
had just then upraised, asking, at the same
time,—“Are you wounded, brother? otherwise
there is no need of a pause.” “Not so;
your shield is wanting,” said Sir Folko,
“while mine is yet uninjured; on which
account I shall lay it aside; for the conditions
of an honourable combat require that our
means of defence and attack should, on both
sides, be the same.” Thereupon he made a
sign that his squire should draw near, and
gave him his blue and gold shield; but Sir
Otto interfered, and would by no means
allow that it should be carried away. Sir
Folko then said, in a grave determined tone,—“Sir
Knight, young as you now are in years
and experience, methinks you must, for this
once, bear with a lesson from me. I have
worn armour some twelve years longer than
you have done, and I know perchance as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303"></span>well as another what is or is not fitting.
Since I have respectfully and thankfully
accepted from you the favour, that when my
horse was wounded, yours should be led out
of the lists, methinks it is not too much to
expect that you should receive some like
grace at the hands of Sir Folko de Montfaucon.”
“You are in the right, my noble brother,”
answered Sir Otto; “I bow to the
judgment of one who is indeed a mirror and
pattern of knighthood.” With these words,
he made a humble obeisance, and an attendant
squire bore away the bright-gleaming
shield. Thereafter the battle was renewed
with fresh spirit and vigour; but had not
continued long, ere one of Sir Otto’s blows
came with such force on the left arm of the
chevalier, that the weapon made its way between
the corslet and cuirass; whereupon a
stream of blood followed the wound. Sir
Folko began to totter, with difficulty supporting
himself on his sword, and ere the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304"></span>Knight of Trautwangen could catch him in
his arms, fell to the ground. Then Sir Otto
kneeled down beside him, after such manner,
that the by-standers at first believed he too
was wounded, and could not support himself;
but ere long they perceived that he was
busily employed in loosening the helmet,
corslet, and cuirass, of his fallen adversary.
Blanchefleur soon hastened from the balcony
to assist in the same services, knelt on the
other side beside her brother, and wept bitterly.
Otto perceiving this, looked at her
kindly. “God be praised,” said he, “your
brother yet lives; and the wound, though on
the left side, has not reached his heart!” At
this moment Sir Folko opened his eyes, and
the Lady Blanchefleur held her hand across
to his opponent, with a smile of thanks for the
kind words that he had spoken. Having respectfully
kissed the beautiful hand thus offered
him, Sir Otto at length arose, and went to the
Count de Vinciguerra to receive the casket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305"></span>with the ring. Thereafter, when he made
his appearance under the green leaves of the
balcony,—when Gabrielle, with a sweet smile,
came forward to meet him,—when the trumpets
flourished, and all the people called out
“Long live Sir Otto von Trautwangen!”
the knight, as if lost in a fairy dream, knelt
down, and in this attitude he placed the ring
on the snow-white finger of the Lady Gabrielle;
while, at the same moment, the too
happy youth felt a soft kiss breathed on his
forehead.</p>

<p class="center">
How Theobaldo departed, and a messenger announced the<br>
coming of the sea-monarch, Arinbiorn.
</p>


<p>Sir Otto had retired to his chamber,
that he might lay aside his armour,
and array himself in a garb suited to the
brilliant festival of his betrothment, after
which the Lady Gabrielle would make her
public appearance as his bride. His apartment
was ere long crowded by squires of
high and low degree, who were sent by the
damsel to attend him, bearing rich presents
of gold chains, rings, plumes of variegated
feathers, and other adornments. In the confusion
of his triumph and happiness, which
seemed, as it were, reflected by the glittering
apparel and cheerful looks of all around him,
he did not think of Theobaldo’s absence, till
he found himself alone at the entrance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307"></span>another chamber, in which the Lady Gabrielle
had appointed him to meet her, in order that
they might walk from thence together into the
magnificent banquet-hall. With his heart
full of the delights which were so richly
poured out around him, he could willingly
have had some confidential friend with whom
he could share his emotions, and was lost in
surprise at Theobaldo’s long absence. At
length the merchant made his appearance;
but dressed so strangely, and in such gay and
varied colours, that Sir Otto scarcely knew
him at his first entrance. Perceiving this,
“You are in the right,” said Theobaldo;
“I am, indeed, changed in my outward
garb; but in this world all is changeable.
Look here, for example, whether you could
recognise the knight of the black and silver
armour in the figure which is now before
you.” With these words he had placed Sir
Otto before a great mirror; wherein, for the
first time, he beheld his own person arrayed
in a style of such glittering magnificence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308"></span>that he blushed and was confounded. His
blooming youthful countenance was half lost
in the folds of a rich embroidered ruff;—under
a green barret cap, clustered his golden
hair, richly perfumed, and shining almost
as brightly as the magnificent <i>agratte</i> which
held together the waving plumes of his head-gear.
Moreover, he had a white velvet
doublet, of which the slashes were adorned
with green and gold; it was fitted tight to
his shape; and round his waist was a golden
sword-belt; while from his shoulders hung,
in graceful folds, a short green mantle, trimmed
with ermine and pearls. “Well,” said
Theobaldo, with somewhat of irony in his
smile, “that is, methinks, no dress fitted
for a pilgrimage into the Holy Land.” “As
little could’st thou say,” answered Sir Otto,
“that the dress which thou now wearest is
that of a crusader.” “Pardon me, noble
sir,” said Theobaldo; “mine is still a travelling
garb; and though, indeed, I shall
take a circuitous route, I shall yet wear this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309"></span>mantle on my voyage into the Holy Land.
I now bear the colours of the Count de
Vinciguerra, which, as you know, are, according
to Italian fashion, somewhat over
gay and motley, and with him I shall in a
few minutes set out on our journey homewards
to my native land, where, at Naples, I
shall take shipping for Palestine, in order to
fight there under the banners of King Richard
Cœur de Lion.” “What then have I
done to offend you?” said Sir Otto; “and
wherefore would you thus wound my heart,
that was even now so happy and buoyant?”
“You have by no means offended me,”
answered Theobaldo; “but you already
know that I love the sports of the battle-field,
and am discontented with the luxuries
of a peaceful home. Therefore you spoke
but the truth, when you said this morning,
that I was attending you perhaps for the last
time. Not only the love of warlike adventure,
but other feelings, also draw me from
hence. I would wish once more to kneel on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310"></span>that church-yard mound, with its sheltering
flowers, wherein Lisberta sleeps. Heaven
knows wherefore, as a child, I was so often
led thither; but it now seems to me as if my
life’s best treasures were buried there, and
I must by times revisit the spot. But,
noble Sir, touching what you have just now
said, of wounding your heart in the midst of
its rejoicing, you should rather be thankful to
me if I have indeed done so; for if trees
are too flourishing and luxuriant, are not
wounds cut into their bark? Or have you
forgot the story of Polycrates, who, in order
to reconcile himself with fortune, threw his
ring into the water? Let me then in like
manner be your ring; and Heaven grant that
no fish may be on the watch in order to bring
me again into your possession!” “But wherefore,”
said Sir Otto, “should you be in such
vehement haste?” “It is the Count de Vinciguerra’s
fault,” said Theobaldo; “I have
promised that I shall travel when and whither
he is pleased to appoint.” “And so then the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311"></span>Count——,” said Otto, doubtfully. “Ay,”
resumed Theobaldo, “he is, in truth, not
altogether satisfied with you, being unable
to forget the severe lessons which he
received from one so young and inexperienced,
when he related the story of Master
Donatello. For, in confidence, he has since
unfolded to me, that he himself was the hero
of that adventure; so that he cannot well
bear to look upon you now as the chief in
this festival; and was indeed ready to sink
into the earth with vexation, when he was
obliged to deliver up to you the casket with
the ring. I could laugh still to think of his
looks at that moment; and in this humour,
noble Sir, it is best that I should take my departure.
Sad thoughts should not at such
times be uttered.”—Otto replied mournfully,
“You have then forgotten how you were
once moved by the thoughts of parting, after
you had wounded the falcon in the forest?”
“Ay truly, because we should then have
separated in anger,” said Theobaldo; “now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312"></span>however, there is perfect friendship betwixt
us, and I leave you with your beautiful
bride, and surrounded by all possible blessings.
So fare you well.” With these words
he nodded kindly, and straightway left the
room. After a few moments, Sir Otto, having
gone thoughtfully to the window, saw the
two Italians, in their motley glittering dresses,
already riding down the steep descent that
led from the castle.</p>

<p>The young German knight continued
to gaze after them with surprise and melancholy,
till he felt a light touch on his shoulder,
and, turning round, beheld Gabrielle
in all the splendour of dress and dazzling
beauty. If the damsel had already appeared
lovely and attractive in her distress on the
battle-field, yet now, as a smiling triumphant
bride, she was yet more angelic, and indeed
surpassed herself. The coronet of jewels that
adorned her hair, and the graceful folds of
her costly attire, were but foils to the matchless
charms of her features, and her every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313"></span>gesture. And in all this pomp and magnificence
she yet bowed humbly to Sir Otto,
and said,—“Why then is the Knight of
Trautwangen so discontented and thoughtful?
Is Gabrielle’s hand no adequate compensation
for the departure of two fantastic comrades
like those who have just left us? Come,
our guests are waiting; clear up those clouded
looks, and lead me to the banquet-hall.”
When Gabrielle pronounced the words, “our
guests,” Sir Otto seemed for the first
time suddenly awake to the full measure
of his good fortunes. He kissed the damsel’s
hand, which was courteously offered him;
he kissed also her rosy lips; for a kind look
said to him that this was not forbidden;—then,
full of delight and triumph, such as he
had never before known, he led her, leaning
on his arm, into the brilliant hall, which was
already filled with company.</p>

<p>All the noble guests who were there assembled
made room and bowed respectfully;
the hautboys and flutes played a cheering
march; flower-wreaths were thrown lavishly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314"></span>on the heads of the happy and blushing
pair. Having arrived at the upper end
of the table, Gabrielle pointed out to her
betrothed husband the noble Chevalier de
Montfaucon, who lay there upon a sofa, attended
and supported by his sister Blanchefleur.
“I well knew,” said she, “that there
was no sight which would be to you more
welcome than that of your valiant adversary
now so much recovered, and able to join in
the festivities of our circle.” “This, indeed,
I had not expected,” said Sir Otto; “yet I
might have been well aware, that for your
powers, beautiful enchantress, nothing could
be too difficult.” “Hush, hush, speak not
of my enchantments,” said Gabrielle; “my
best influence is derived from the Ring, of
which your valour has again won for me
the possession.” Meanwhile Sir Folko, with
the help of Blanchefleur, had raised himself
on the couch. Pale indeed in complexion,
but smiling kindly, he proffered his
right hand to the victorious Knight of Trautwangen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315"></span>which the latter took with as much
emotion as if it had been that of a kind-hearted
elder brother, and could scarcely refrain
from pressing it to his lips. The whole
party now sat down to table, and thereafter
every one admired the fine figure of De
Montfaucon, as he lay there in his light-blue
mantle embroidered with gold; while
his falcon, wounded like himself, sat on his
pillow, sipping now and then out of the
knight’s golden cup. “I am treated here
like a sick child,” said Sir Folko, “who,
wherever he goes, must have his toys along
with him.” There were minstrels in attendance,
who compared the knight to the
wounded Adonis, of whom we read in the
ancient fables; and every one allowed, that,
from his graceful figure, as well as heroic
courage, he might well have been the
favourite of the goddess Cytherea.</p>

<p>While they were now all happily seated
round the table, fragrant with the richest
viands and rarest wines, there was heard at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316"></span>the gate a loud and terrific blast from a warhorn,
or trumpet. In a few moments thereafter,
a gigantic man, completely equipt in a
heavy rattling coat of mail, with a great
towering halbert in his hand, made his appearance
in the hall, looked round inquiringly
for some time at the astonished party,
and then with a courteous bow drew near to
the Chevalier de Montfaucon. “Noble sir,”
said he, “I have been sent hither by the great
sea-monarch, Arinbiorn, your friend and
cousin. He is now waiting before your
gates, and has travelled thus far into the
land for the sole purpose of visiting you.
He now wishes to learn, whether it may be
your will and pleasure to receive him at this
time within your castle, along with some
noble damsels and giants by whom he is accompanied.
Be it known to you also, that
one of these damsels is in conduct and character
somewhat mysterious.” “If I had
still the right of commanding here,” answered
Sir Folko, “the wound by which I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317"></span>now suffer would scarcely prevent me from
coming to the gate, to welcome your royal
master. Yet now,”——Gabrielle here interrupted
him, kindly counterfeiting a tone of
anger: “Noble Chevalier,” said she, “if
you should not here conduct yourself as the
lord and owner of the mansion, it follows,
that we and our guests must immediately
take our departure.”—“That indeed must
be listened to,” said Sir Folko, turning to
the stranger: “Go then, and tell the king
that he and all his train are heartily
welcome. I too shall come forth to receive
him.”—Hereupon he endeavoured to rise from
his couch; but, reading fear and anxiety in
the beautiful eyes of Blanchefleur, the gigantic
messenger interposed. “In the name
of King Arinbiorn,” said he, “I forbid you
to leave this apartment. Though indeed a
powerful champion might not die of such
exertion, yet it is enough that the beautiful
damsel beside you would feel terror for your
sake,—and a valiant knight should never inflict
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318"></span>pain on a female heart. Therefore, so truly
as I know and respect my royal master’s will,
so earnestly do I beg that you will remain
here. He will come to you forthwith.”
Then he shook the knight’s right hand
heartily, like an old friend, and with a courtly
salutation retired. “The sea-monarch, Arinbiorn,”
said Sir Folko, “is a brave Norman,
who now represents that family tree, from
which, in old times, the branch to which I
myself belong was divided, and removed from
Norway’s frozen hills to plant itself in these
fertile fields under the warm sun of France.
The ties of relationship have ever since then
been acknowledged as unbroken betwixt us,
and our friendship has been proved in many
stern and warlike encounters against mutual
foes, wherein the sea-monarch has rendered
us no little service. This title has been
given to such of the northern heroes as
have perchance few or no possessions on
shore, but who in their fleet vessels, accompanied
by brave and faithful soldiers, sail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319"></span>about through all quarters of the world, from
the distant icebergs of the north to the brilliant
city of Constantinople, or even to the
shores of Asia and Africa, with their mines
of gold. In truth, there are scarcely any
mariners that know their way so well, and
where, on account of their great excellence in
the arts of warfare, they can exercise unlimited
power.”</p>

<p>Sir Folko might have narrated still farther,
and the party listened to him willingly; but
they already heard the steps of the wonderful
stranger on the staircase, and the eyes of
every one were fixed on the portal.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
