<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">ell</span> your father to go to hell. Try it. It’s a rotten
hard thing to do, even if he deserves it. Merrill Landon
did. He was an out-and-out bastard, but like most of the
breed, he didn’t know it. He said he was a good father:
sensible, firm, and just. He said everything he did was
for Laura’s own good. He took her opposition for a sign
that he was right, and the more she opposed him, the
righter he swore he was.
</p>

<p>
But he was a bastard. Laura could have told you that.
But she couldn’t tell <em>him</em>, because he was her father. That
was why she ran out on him. Left him high, dry, and
sputtering in his plush Chicago apartment with only his
job to console him. And never told him where she went.
Never told him why.
</p>

<p>
Never told him of the angry agony of her nights, spent
torching for a love gone wrong. Never mentioned his
straight-laced bitter version of fatherly affection that
hurt her more than his fits of temper. He never kissed
her. He never touched her. He only told her, “No, Laura,”
and “You’re wrong, as usual,” and “Can’t you do it right
for once?”
</p>

<p>
She had taken it all her life, but it was the worst the
year after she left school. It was a year of confinement
in luxury, of tightly controlled resentment, of soul-searching.
And one rainy night when he was out at a press dinner,
she packed a small bag and went to Union Station.
<a class="pagenum" title="6" id="page-6"></a>
She bought a ticket to New York City. She could never
be free from herself, but she could be free from her
father, and at the moment that mattered the most.
</p>

<p>
So she rode out of the big city, wet and cold with its
January gloss, and left behind Merrill Landon, her father.
The man in her life. The only man in her life. The only
man she ever seriously tried to love.
</p>

<p>
All she wanted from New York was a job, a place to
live, a friend or two. As long as she won them herself,
without her father’s help, she would be happy. Much happier
than when she had been surrounded with comfortable
leather chairs, sheathed in sleek fine clothes, smelling
like an expensive rose.
</p>

<p>
In school Laura had studied journalism. She did it to
avoid a showdown with Merrill Landon. He had always
taken it for granted that she would follow his profession,
just as if she were a doting son anxious to imitate a successful
father. She accepted his tyranny quietly, but with a
corrosive resentment that he was unaware of. There were
times when she hated him so actively for making a slave
of her that he saw it and said, “Laura, for Chrissake,
don’t pout at me! Snap out of it. Act your age.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was more afraid of loving Landon than leaving
him. She was afraid the yearning in her would flare someday
when he gave her one of his rare smiles. When he
said, “Klein says you’re learning fast. Good girl.” And her
knees went weak. But he saved her by quickly adding
with embarrassed sarcasm, “But you messed up the water
tower assignment. Jesus, I can never count on you, can I?”
</p>

<p>
When things became intolerable she left him at last with
no showdown at all. She had considered going in to tell
him about it. Walking into the library where he was
working, where she was expressly forbidden to go in the
evenings, and saying, “Father, I’m leaving you. I’m going
to New York. I can’t stand it here anymore.”
</p>

<p>
He would have been brilliantly sarcastic. He would have
described her to herself in terms so exaggerated that she
would see herself as a grotesque mistake of nature, a freak
in a fun-house mirror. He was not above such abuse.
He had done it to her a few times before. Once, when she
was very young and hadn’t learned to tiptoe around his
temper yet, and once when she quit school.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="7" id="page-7"></a>
Not all his threats and tantrums could send her back
to school, however. There was a ghost lurking there that
Laura could never face, that Landon knew nothing about.
He was forced to let her stay at home, but he committed
her to journalism at once, and made her work on his
paper with one of his assistants.
</p>

<p>
Even Laura was surprised when she was able to resist
him about returning to school. She wouldn’t have thought
she could stick it out. Especially when he roared at her,
“Why? Why! Why! Why! Answer me, you stubborn little
bitch!” And smashed an ashtray at her feet.
</p>

<p>
She did not, <em>could</em> not, tell him why. It took all her
courage to admit it even to herself. She simply said, “I
won’t go back, Father.”
</p>

<p>
“Why!”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?” It was menacing this time.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t go back.”
</p>

<p>
In the end he swore at her and hurt her with the same
ugly irrelevant argument he always used when she resisted
him. “You know why you’re alive today, don’t you?
Because I saved you! I dragged you out of the water and
let your mother drown. And your brother. I could only
save one, and it was <em>you</em> I saved! God, what a mistake.
My son. My wife!” And he would turn away, groaning.
</p>

<p>
“You weren’t trying to save <em>me</em>, Father,” she said once.
“You just grabbed the nearest one and swam for shore.
You screamed at Mother to save Rod and then you
dragged me to shore. It’s a miracle you saved even me.
You see, I remember it too. I remember it very well.”
</p>

<p>
He turned a pale furious face to her. “You dare to tell
me what <em>you</em> remember? You silly little white-faced girl?
You don’t remember anything? Don’t tell me what you
remember!”
</p>

<p>
So she chose a night when he was out and left him
without a word, at the start of an unfriendly January,
and came to New York. Her first thought was to try to
get work on one of the giant dailies. With her experience,
surely they could find something for her. But then she
realized her father was too well known in journalism circles.
She hated the thoughts of his finding her. He had
struck her more than once, and his anger with her sometimes
<a class="pagenum" title="8" id="page-8"></a>
reached such heights that she trembled in terror,
expecting him to brutalize her. But it never went that far.
</p>

<p>
No, newspapers were out. Magazines were out. It would
have to be something completely divorced from the world
of journalism. She studied the want-ads for weeks. She
tried to land a job as receptionist with a foreign airline,
but her French was too poor.
</p>

<p>
Then, after about two weeks, she found a small ad for
a replacement secretary to a prominent radiologist,
someone with experience preferred. It appealed to her,
without her exactly knowing why. She didn’t really suppose
she had much of a chance of getting it and it was
silly to try. Who wanted a temporary job? Most girls
were supposed to want security. But Laura wasn’t like
most girls. She was like damn few girls, in fact. She was
a loner: strange, dream-ridden, mildly neurotic, curiously
interesting, like somebody who has a secret.
</p>

<p>
The next morning she was in the office of Dr. Hollingsworth,
talking to his secretary. The secretary, a tremendously
tall girl with big bones, a friendly face, and a
sort of uncomfortable femininity, liked her right away.
</p>

<p>
“I’m Jean Bergman,” she said. “Come on in and sit
down. Dr. Hollingsworth isn’t here yet; he gets in at nine.”
</p>

<p>
Laura introduced herself and said she’d like to have the
job. She was a hard worker. Jean was disposed to believe
her, on a hunch. It was one of those lucky breaks.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve talked to some other girls,” she said, “but nobody
seems to have had any experience. The girls with training
want permanent jobs. So I guess I’ll just have to find a
bright beginner.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at her. She spoke as if it was settled. “The
job will last till June first, Laura,” Jean went on.
“I’ll be gone two months. We’ll spend the time till then
teaching you the routine. Sarah will be coming in in a
minute—she’s the other secretary. There’ll be plenty for
the three of us.” She paused, eying Laura critically. “Well?
Do you think you’d like a crack at it?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I would.” Laura felt her heart lighten.
</p>

<p>
“Okay.” Jean smiled. “I’m a trusting soul. You strike
me as the efficient type. Of course, I’ll have to introduce
you to Dr. Hollingsworth. You understand. Now don’t let
me down, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="9" id="page-9"></a>
“I won’t. Thanks, Jean.”
</p>

<p>
“You might make yourself indispensable, you know,”
Jean said. “I mean, they really need three girls around
here. If they like you well enough—well, maybe they’ll
keep you on in June. It’s just a chance; don’t count on
it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt really worthwhile for the first time since she
left home. She had never considered turning back, but
there had been moments when the barren want-ads discouraged
her and the wet biting weather dragged her
spirits down. Now, the sun was shining through the rain.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It turned out to be a fine office to work in. Doctors
have a crazy sense of humor and they are often tolerant.
Dr. Hollingsworth was small and quiet, quite dignified
but tender-hearted. He had two young assistants, Dr.
Carstens and Dr. Hagstrom. They were both fresh from
medical school—pleasant young men. Carstens was married,
but with a wildly roving eye. Every female patient
fascinated him, even if he saw no more than her lungs.
Hagstrom had a permanent girl friend named Rosie with
whom he conducted endless conversations on the phone.
Both were devoted to Dr. Hollingsworth and considered
themselves lucky to be with him.
</p>

<p>
Laura fell into the routine rapidly. She was much slower
than the other girls at translating the mumbo-jumbo on
the dictaphone at first. She spent nearly half the time
looking up terms in the medical dictionary and the
rest beating the typewriter.
</p>

<p>
The problem of finding a place to live before the hotel
bills broke her was urgent. She discovered in a hurry, like
most newcomers to New York, that it was a real struggle
to find a decent apartment at a decent price. She asked
Jean about it.
</p>

<p>
“I’m stuck,” she said. “Where do people <em>live</em> in this
town?”
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter with me?” Jean said. “I should have
asked you if you had a place. I know a girl who’s looking
for a roommate. The one she had just got hitched. I’ll
call her.”
</p>

<p>
Later she told Laura, “I talked to her. She says a couple
of gals have already asked her, but to call if you want to.
<a class="pagenum" title="10" id="page-10"></a>
She hasn’t made up her mind yet. She’s a doll, you’ll
like her. Here’s her number.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s her name?”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie Proffitt. <em>Mrs.</em> Proffitt.” She laughed at Laura’s
consternation. “She’s divorced,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura called at once.
</p>

<p>
“I’m at West End and a hundred and first,” Marcie
said when Laura got her. Her voice was low and appealing.
Laura hoped she looked like she sounded. “The penthouse,”
Marcie said. “It’s not locked. You have to walk
up the last flight.”
</p>

<p>
“A penthouse?” Laura said, taken aback. “Jean said—”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not as fancy as it sounds,” Marcie laughed. “In
fact it’s falling apart. That’s how I can afford it. But it
has a wonderful view. Come over tonight. I’ll give you
some dinner. I may be late, though, so I’ll leave a key
for you under the doormat.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Marcie, I’d like to.” Laura wondered, when
she hung up, if Marcie’s hospitality was always so impulsive.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was dark and getting windy when Laura got off the
subway at 99th Street. She walked the two blocks up
Broadway to 101st, holding her coat collar close around
her throat.
</p>

<p>
The apartment building was a block off Broadway, up
a hill at the corner of West End Avenue. It had been a
chic address once, some years ago, when West End was an
exclusive neighborhood. But it was deteriorating now,
quietly, almost inconspicuously, slipping into the hands of
ordinary people—families with lots of kids and not much
money, students, working girls. And the <em>haut monde</em> was
quietly slipping out and heading for the other side of
town.
</p>

<p>
Laura entered the vestibule. It looked like the reception
hall in a medieval fort. The only light came from a small
bare bulb on a desk in one corner. The whole hall was
full of heavy shadows.
</p>

<p>
Laura found the elevator tucked into a corner and
pressed the button. She swung slowly around on her heels
to look at the hall while she waited. It gave her the
shivers.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="11" id="page-11"></a>
She climbed into the elevator with misgivings. It looked
well used and little cleaned. There was a paper sticker
plastered on the wall above the button panel saying that
it had passed inspection until June of that year. Laura
looked it up and down and wondered if it would last till
June. She reached the twelfth and last floor and walked
out into a hall. To the right of the elevator she found a
pair of swinging doors, and beyond them a steel staircase.
She climbed the stairs, her heels ringing, and found herself
in a short dark hall with two doors in it: one to the
penthouse, one to the roof. Laura went out on the roof
for a look.
</p>

<p>
She walked over the red tiling toward a stone griffin
carved on the railing and looked over it to the city. Below
her, around her on all sides, sparkled New York. It
honked and shouted down there, it murmured and
sighed, it blinked and glittered like a gorgeous whore
waiting to be conquered. Laura breathed deep and smiled
secretly at it. She could live with a dank front hall and
patched up elevator for a view like this.
</p>

<p>
It was ten minutes before she went into the dark corridor
again and found the penthouse door. She rang twice
and when there was no answer she fumbled in the darkness
for the key under the mat and unlocked the door. It
opened into an unlit living room. Laura went in, shut the
door behind her and stumbled around looking for a light
switch. She knocked something off a table and heard it
break before she discovered a lamp in a far corner and
pulled the cord.
</p>

<p>
The room was small and furnished with bamboo furniture—a
couch, an easy chair, a round cocktail table.
There was a console radio against one wall, and books
were lying around on the floor and furniture. There were
a couple of loaded ashtrays and one lay shattered on the
floor—Laura’s fault.
</p>

<p>
Laura found the switch in the kitchen. It was long and
narrow, painted a garish yellow. Beyond that was the bedroom,
with two beds and two dressers jammed into it,
and some shoes and underwear scattered around. It was
bright blue, with two big windows opening onto the roof.
The bathroom was enormous, almost as big as the bedroom,
and the same noisy yellow as the kitchen. All the
<a class="pagenum" title="12" id="page-12"></a>
pipes were exposed and the plumbing looked as if it were
full of bugs.
</p>

<p>
Laura walked back into the living room and sat down
stiffly. She began to have serious misgivings. This was no
place for a civilized girl to live. Surely in this tremendous
city there was an apartment for a girl that didn’t have
an astronomical rent. And where she could eat in private
out of cans.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door burst open and Marcie came in.
And Laura forgot her discomfort.
</p>

<p>
Marcie smiled. “I’m Marcie. Hi.”
</p>

<p>
Laura cursed the shyness that tied knots in her tongue.
</p>

<p>
“How do you like this crazy little palace?” Marcie said,
gesturing grandly around her.
</p>

<p>
“It’s very nice.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed, and Laura was struck with the sweet
perfection of her features. Her lips were full and finely
balanced; her nose was of medium length and dainty.
Hair with true gold hue that no peroxide can imitate
framed her face and hung nearly to her shoulders. She had
the lucky black lashes and eyebrows that sometimes happen
to blondes, and high color in her cheeks. She was, in
short, a lovely looking girl. Laura smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a hole,” said Marcie. “Don’t be polite. The rent is
one thirty a month.”
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped.
</p>

<p>
“I know. It sounds awful. But that’s only sixty-five
apiece. And it includes maid service—so-called. The maid
doesn’t pick up a damn thing. Did you see the rest of the
place?”
</p>

<p>
Laura nodded.
</p>

<p>
“Discouraged?”
</p>

<p>
“A little.” Laura followed Marcie awkwardly into the
kitchen.
</p>

<p>
“You’d better know the worst right off,” Marcie went
on. “Three other girls have called wanting to share this
place with me.” Laura’s incredulous face made her laugh.
“It’s not that the place is irresistible,” she explained.
“It’s just that apartments are hard to get in this town. Sit
down, Laura.” Laura obeyed her, finding a chair at the
kitchen table while Marcie fussed at the stove. “Have you
been here long?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="13" id="page-13"></a>
“Three weeks.”
</p>

<p>
“Where did you come from?”
</p>

<p>
“Chicago.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, <em>that</em> place. I was there once with Burr. He was
my husband.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” Laura said softly, almost sympathetically, as if
Marcie had announced his demise.
</p>

<p>
“Well, don’t put on a long face,” Marcie said with a sudden
laugh. “He’s divorced, not dead. It was final last November.”
Her face became serious again and she gave Laura
a plate of vegetables and hamburger. “He’s very nice to
know,” Marcie mused. “But hell to live with. Laura, do
you cook?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t boil water.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I can do that much.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie lapsed into silence then, her burst of charming
vitality spent. She ate quietly, as if unaware of Laura’s presence,
gazing at the table cloth and forking her food up
mechanically. She had withdrawn suddenly and soundlessly
into a private corner where fatigue and secret
thoughts absorbed her.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt more awkward than ever. She was afraid to interrupt
Marcie’s reverie, but like all shy people she was
convinced that if you can just keep the other person talking
everything will be all right. It was an urge she couldn’t
resist. After a few false starts she said, “Have you been in
New York long, Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
Marcie looked at her, mildly surprised to find her still
there. “Yes. Since we were married.” She spoke absently,
turning to her plate.
</p>

<p>
“When was that?”
</p>

<p>
“Three years ago.” She came suddenly back to the present.
“Laura, did you ever love a man and hate him at
the same time?”
</p>

<p>
Laura was nonplussed. This was more than she counted
on. “Well—I don’t know exactly.” She wasn’t sure if she
had ever loved Merrill Landon. She knew well enough
how she hated him.
</p>

<p>
“I shouldn’t throw my problems in your face like that,
before you get your dinner down,” Marcie smiled. She
reached out and gave Laura’s arm a pat that made Laura
jump a little. “It’s just that that damn character proposed
<a class="pagenum" title="14" id="page-14"></a>
to me again today. I don’t know what to do with him. I
thought maybe you could give me some advice. Have you
ever been married?”
</p>

<p>
“Me? No,” said Laura emphatically, as if it were a
slightly lewd suggestion. “Who is ‘that character’?”
</p>

<p>
“Burr. My ex-husband.”
</p>

<p>
“He wants to marry you again?” It seemed unnatural
to Laura. If the marriage were legally over, physically
over, emotionally over, why beat the carcass?
</p>

<p>
“Yes. The fool.” Marcie smiled ruefully. “He’s a very
persuasive fool, though.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie was one of those people with the rare gift of intimacy.
You knew her a few minutes, an hour, a couple
of days, and you discovered to your surprise that you felt
close to her. It wasn’t the personal revelations she couldn’t
help making, as much as it was her look, her questions
that asked for Laura’s help. Laura felt curiously like an
expert on marital affairs, and it was so ridiculous that
she smiled.
</p>

<p>
“What’s funny?” Marcie asked.
</p>

<p>
“You make me feel like Miss Lonelyhearts or something,”
Laura said.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed. “You don’t have to give me advice,
Laura, just because I ask for it. I guess you can’t anyway
if you’re single. But just for the hell of it, what would you
do if a decent honorable sort of ex-husband chased you
like a demon and swore he’d kill you if you went out with
anybody else?”
</p>

<p>
“I’d send him to a clinic.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie shook her head. “He’s healthy. If I didn’t know
we’d quarrel twenty-four hours a day, I’d marry him tomorrow.”
She sighed. “I almost said yes to him today.
What’s the matter with me? I’m not a dope. Or am I?”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t look like one,” Laura said uncomfortably.
</p>

<p>
“Poor Laura!” Marcie laughed. “I’m embarrassing you to
tears. You make a good listening post. Come on, finish
your hamburger. It didn’t kill me.”
</p>

<p>
When they cleared up the dishes, Marcie turned on the
tap in the sink. A thin hesitant stream of water was called
up after some pitiful groaning from the pipes. Marcie
kicked a pipe under the sink.
</p>

<p>
“It’s enough to drive you wild!” she exclaimed. “Some
<a class="pagenum" title="15" id="page-15"></a>
nights you have to wait around till the cows come home
before there’s enough to wash anything in. Oh, here it
comes!”
</p>

<p>
With a scream the pipes vomited steaming water. Marcie
looked at Laura and the little smile on her face widened.
Suddenly they were laughing hilariously. Laura felt the
laughter soothing and tickling her tight muscles, making
her relax.
</p>

<p>
“It hates me,” Marcie said to the sink, grasping the
faucets and rattling them furiously. The stream came to an
abrupt halt. She turned to Laura again. “Do you think
you can stand it?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I think I can.” Laura knew now why she wanted to
move in, but she was ready to ignore the reason. She
would bury it, forget it. It had no place in her world
any more. She would say to herself, and half believe, that
she was moving in simply because apartments were hard
to find; because she could pay the rent on this one; because
she and Marcie were congenial. Period. “What’s
your job like?” she asked Marcie casually.
</p>

<p>
“I’m supposed to be a typist-receptionist,” Marcie said.
“But I could never type very well. Mr. Marquardt doesn’t
care, though. He just told me to make a good impression
on his customers and don’t chew gum on the job. I told
him that would be a cinch, and he said, ‘You’re hired.’”
She laughed. “He’s nuts. But it’s a great job. I just sit
around most of the day.”
</p>

<p>
<em>With a face like that, I’m not surprised</em>, Laura thought.
It gave her a bad feeling. Laura worked hard, she tried
hard at anything she did. It was part of her nature. Either
you did a thing the whole way or you didn’t do it at all.
It was part of Merrill Landon’s code that had rubbed off
on her. It made her a little jealous to hear this lovely girl
brushing idly over a comfortable job that asked almost
nothing of her. Marcie would not have understood Laura’s
feelings at all.
</p>

<p>
“You’ll get along fine with Burr,” Marcie said, drying
her hands on a towel. “He’s always reading something.
Those are his books in there.” She waved a hand toward
the living room. “He brings them over in hopes that I’ll
improve my mind.” She made a face and Laura smiled
at her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="16" id="page-16"></a>
“Does he come over a lot?” Laura asked.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but don’t worry. He’s harmless. He talks like Hamlet
sometimes—gloomy, I mean—but he’s nice to dogs and
children. He has a parakeet, too. I always think a man
who has a parakeet can’t be very vicious. Besides, I lived
with him for two years, and the worst he ever did to
me was spank me one time. We shouted at each other
constantly, but we didn’t hit each other.”
</p>

<p>
“Sounds restful,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed and went into the bedroom. “See if you
think you’ll have enough room in here,” she called to
Laura, who followed her slowly. “It’s pretty crowded, but
the bathroom makes up for it. We could fence it off and
make an extra room of it if we wanted to.”
</p>

<p>
Laura sat down on one of the beds. “I like it fine,
Marcie,” she said. “I’d like to move in. If you think we’d
get along.” She looked at her lap, confused. She never
said these things right. Marcie laughed good-naturedly
and flopped on the bed beside Laura, on her stomach.
Laura had to twist around to see her. “Oh, I can get
along with anybody,” she said. “Even you. I’ll bet you’re
terribly hard to get along with.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t think so. I mean—” She never knew when she
was being teased until she had put on a solemn face and
felt like an ass. “I’m impossible,” she said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
“That settles it!” Marcie exclaimed, sitting up with the
pillow crushed against her bosom.
</p>

Chapter Two
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hey</span> got along unusually well together, as the weeks
passed into months. April came, and Jean left on her
European tour. Laura and Sarah were alone in the office
with the doctors, and Laura worked with a will to make
up for what she still had to learn. With each day, each
fact acquired and skill polished, the job meant more to
her.
</p>

<p>
At home, there were no scenes or suspicions, such as female
roommates have a talent for. Laura was quiet, shyly
friendly, thoughtful. Marcie gave her a cram course in
cooking, saw an occasional movie with her, and asked her
how to spell things. Most of her free time was spent with
Burr.
</p>

<p>
Laura liked Marcie very much. She tried to keep it that
way. She was relieved, as time went on, that her friendship
didn’t get complicated by stronger feelings.
</p>

<p>
<em>I like Marcie, and that’s all</em>, she mused to herself one
time. It gave her a certain satisfaction that most women
would not have understood.
</p>

<p>
As for Marcie, she was somewhat amused with Laura;
with her modesty, which seemed so old-fashioned; with
her shyness; with her books. But she felt a real affection
for her. Laura wasn’t much for gossip, but she always listened
to Marcie’s compulsive confessions. She was gentle
and sympathetic. Her ideas were different, and Marcie
listened to her with respect.
</p>

<p>
Laura wasn’t pretty, but at certain angles, with certain
expressions, she was striking and even memorable. Not
everyone saw this quality; not everyone took the trouble
to study her features. But they made a curious appeal to
those who did. Her face was long and slim, and her coloring
pale. But her eyes were deep and cornflower blue. If
Marcie had studied them she might have seen more worldly
wisdom than she dreamed of in her bookish roommate.
</p>

<p>
Laura had a good grasp on what it meant to be a
woman; on what it meant to live deeply, completely, even
<a class="pagenum" title="18" id="page-18"></a>
when it didn’t last; on what it meant to be a loser. And
everyone must lose at least once before he can understand
what it is to win.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Burr had come over the night after Laura moved in. He
was of medium height but powerfully built, with a pleasant
face. His brown hair was crew cut, his brown eyes
sparkled zealously, like those of a man with a mission.
His mission, apparently, was Marcie. He seemed to adore
her; it was so plain, in fact, that it made you wonder if it
was real.
</p>

<p>
He walked into the kitchen where Laura and Marcie were
finishing the dishes, grabbed Marcie without a word to
Laura—he didn’t even seem to see her—and kissed her passionately.
Laura self-consciously wiped a dish, put it on
the cupboard shelf, and started to back out of the room.
</p>

<p>
“Burr! You could have said hello!” Marcie gasped when
he released her. “Laura, don’t go. This is—” But he
kissed her again. This time when he let go she was mad.
It was beautiful to see. Laura was exhilarated with the
force of it. Marcie, who was always full of laughter, was
walloping Burr with a wet dishcloth and calling him,
“You bastard!” Her eyes flashed, and she swiped at his
face with long meticulously pointed nails. Laura headed
for the bedroom, but Marcie turned and caught her.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” she said, pulling Laura back. “I want you to
see what I married. I want you to tell me if I wasn’t
smart to get a divorce. Look at him.”
</p>

<p>
Burr, his face damp with dishwater, was gently exploring
a nail-inflicted wound with one finger.
</p>

<p>
Laura tried to back out, but Burr saw her then and
smiled. “Hello, Laura,” he said. “You’ll have to forgive
my charming wife. She’s very emotional.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not your wife!” Marcie flared.
</p>

<p>
Laura couldn’t help thinking it was all a joke. They
both seemed to be enjoying it too much.
</p>

<p>
Burr ignored Marcie. “You’ve probably never seen this
side of her,” he remarked to Laura. “I used to get it once
or twice a day, like medicine. Finally drove me to divorce.”
Marcie threw a towel at him and he smiled pleasantly at
Laura. “But don’t let it bother you. You’ll never have to
marry her, so you’ll avoid the problem.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="19" id="page-19"></a>
There was a stormy pause. “Have some coffee?” Laura
said suddenly to Burr.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll fix him a highball,” Marcie sighed. “He hates coffee.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t hate it. Why do you exaggerate, honey?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, you drink that horrible Postum crap, like all the
grandfathers.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not crap. It’s a hell of a lot better for you than
coffee, I can tell you that.”
</p>

<p>
“Then why don’t you live on it, darling?”
</p>

<p>
“If I wanted sarcasm tonight, I would have gone over
to Chita’s.”
</p>

<p>
“That whore!”
</p>

<p>
“I—I think I’ll turn in,” Laura said softly and hurried
toward the door.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be silly!” Marcie looked at her, chagrined. “You
haven’t said two words to Burr.”
</p>

<p>
“She couldn’t say two words, honey. You’ve been talking
too fast. I couldn’t either, for that matter.” He went
over to Laura and led her by the hand to a chair. “Let’s
talk about you,” he said. “Sit down.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt ridiculous, but she obeyed him.
</p>

<p>
“Where’re you from?” he demanded.
</p>

<p>
“She’s from Chicago.” Marcie handed him his drink and
perched on the drainboard of the sink.
</p>

<p>
“Say something from Chicago, Laura.” He grinned at
her.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged and laughed, embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
“What does your old man do?”
</p>

<p>
Laura was startled to think of him. He had been out of
her mind in the bustle of moving in with Marcie. “He’s a
writer—a newspaperman,” she said. She looked so uncomfortable
that Burr let it drop.
</p>

<p>
After a slight quiet he said, “What do you think of
my girl?”
</p>

<p>
“Burr, please!” Marcie exclaimed, but he waved at her
to shut up.
</p>

<p>
“You know you won’t be rooming with her for long,
don’t you?” He smiled at Laura, and it looked like a
warning sort of smile. It made Laura faintly queasy, as
if she had already done something wrong.
</p>

<p>
Laura hated to compliment a woman. It was always
<a class="pagenum" title="20" id="page-20"></a>
hypocritical because she could never tell the truth without
blushing. The more she admired a girl, the harder it was
to talk about her. She began to blush. “She’s a very nice
girl,” she said hesitantly.
</p>

<p>
“Say it like you mean it!” Burr said. “She’s a wonderful
girl. Even if she is a shrew.”
</p>

<p>
“Damn! Stop humiliating us, Burr. You aren’t funny.”
</p>

<p>
Burr stared at Laura, until she had to say something. “We
get along just fine,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Sure. The first two days.” He laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
“Burr!” Marcie exploded. “She’s a girl, not an ornery
bastard male like you.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I hope you two will be ecstatically happy,” he
said, and downed his drink.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t be talked about like this!” Marcie said. She
dropped down from the drainboard and started out of the
room, but Burr caught her around the waist. He was sitting
next to Laura, and he buried his face in Marcie’s
stomach. Marcie tried to grasp his short hair and push
him back. Laura felt the old revulsion rising in her. Burr
was doing nothing very shocking or immoral. He was just
embracing the girl he loved, the girl who had been his
wife. Laura knew that intellectually but her spirit retreated
from the sight, repulsed.
</p>

<p>
“You know something, Laura?” Burr turned his head
to look at her, still pressed against Marcie. “She acts
like a damn virgin with me. She acts like she didn’t
have any idea what it’s all about. Like we’d never
been married at all, and I’d never—well, never mind
what I did. She won’t let me do it anymore.”
</p>

<p>
“Burr, you’re really repulsive,” Marcie said, shaking
her head at him.
</p>

<p>
“Am I?” He smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
“You know you are. Laura doesn’t want to hear about
that. Do you Laura?”
</p>

<p>
“I think I’d better get to bed,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“That’s a good girl,” Burr said approvingly. “Always
knows when to cut out. Laura, we’re going to get
along fine.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t go, Laura!” Marcie ordered her.
</p>

<p>
Laura, halfway to the bedroom, stopped.
</p>

<p>
“Scram!” said Burr. As she shut the door behind her
he added, “Sweet dreams, Laura. You’re a doll.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="21" id="page-21"></a>
Laura shut the door on them as he took Marcie, still
resisting, in his arms. She walked uncertainly around
the bedroom for a few minutes. It occurred to her that
Burr would be grateful for the use of the bedroom, but
Marcie would never forgive her for suggesting it. Laura
ran a bath—it took fifteen minutes to get enough
water to sit in—and sat contemplatively in it, wondering
what her roommate was doing in the kitchen.
She tried not to think of it. But when a thing revolted
her it stuck stubbornly in her head and tormented her
deeply.
</p>

<p>
Laura climbed out of the tub and dried herself, looking
in the mirror as she did so. She had never liked
the looks of herself very well. It still amazed her to think
that this slim white body of hers; this tall, slightly
awkward, firm-fleshed body, had been desirable to someone
once. She studied herself. She was not remarkable.
She was not lush and ripe and sweet-scented. On the
contrary, she was firm and flat everywhere, with long
limbs and fine bones. Her pale hair hung long over her
shoulders and bangs framed her brow.
</p>

<p>
<em>I am certainly not beautiful</em>, she thought consciously
to herself. <em>And yet I have been loved. I have loved.</em>
</p>

<p>
She gazed at herself for a moment more and the ghosts
of old kisses sent shivers down her limbs. Then she
rubbed herself briskly with the towel and put her pajamas
on.
</p>

<p>
<em>That’s over now</em>, she said to herself. <em>That happened a
million years ago. I’m not the same Laura anymore. I
can’t—I won’t love like that again. I’ll work, I’ll read,
I’ll travel. Some people aren’t made for love. Even when
they find it, it’s wrong. I’m one of those.</em>
</p>

<p>
She picked up a book she had been reading—one of
Burr’s—and climbed into bed. There was a small lamp
between the beds and she switched it on, drawing her
knees up for a book rest. The covers formed a tent over
her legs.
</p>

<p>
For a long while she sat and read about the mixups
of other people, the people in the book. Then she closed
it and put it on the bedside table. She turned the light
off, but still she didn’t lie down. She simply sat there
in the dark, listening ... listening ... and heard
nothing. She put her head back, resting, thinking
<a class="pagenum" title="22" id="page-22"></a>
about them in the other room, hating her thoughts but
unable to shake them. After a while she slept, still sitting
half-upright.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Much later, muscle cramps woke her up and forced
her to lie down. She noticed that the light under the
kitchen door was out. She pulled the covers over her
shoulders, wondering what time it was. In a moment,
all was silence again.
</p>

<p>
“Laura?” It was Marcie, whispering.
</p>

<p>
Laura sat up with a start. “Yes? Marcie, are you all
right?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m all right.”
</p>

<p>
“Is he gone?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. For the time being.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh. What time is it?”
</p>

<p>
“About three.”
</p>

<p>
“You shouldn’t stay up so late. You have to go to work
in the morning.”
</p>

<p>
There was a little silence.
</p>

<p>
“Laura?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes?”
</p>

<p>
“Were you ever in love?”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt a terrible wave of emotion come up in her
throat. What a damnable time, what a damnable way,
to ask such a question! She was defenseless against her
feeling in the soft black night, with the soft voice of
a lovely girl asking her, “Were you ever in love?” For
a while she tried to keep her mouth clamped shut. But
Marcie asked her again and she was undone.
</p>

<p>
“Were you, Laura?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“What was it like?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, God, Marcie—it was so long ago—it was so
complicated. I don’t know what it was like.”
</p>

<p>
“Was it good?”
</p>

<p>
“It was awful.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie turned over in bed at this, raising herself
on her elbows. “Wasn’t it good sometimes? Now and
then?”
</p>

<p>
“Now and then—” Laura whispered, “it was paradise.
But most of the time it was hell.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="23" id="page-23"></a>
“Did—did he love you? As much, I mean?”
</p>

<p>
Laura pressed her hands to her mouth, not trusting
herself for a minute. Then she whispered, “No.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I’m sorry.” Marcie’s voice was warm with sympathy.
“Men are such bastards, aren’t they?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. They are.”
</p>

<p>
After a moment of thought Marcie said, “Burr likes
you.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m glad.” She couldn’t stand to talk any more. “Goodnight,
Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“Goodnight, Laura.” Marcie sounded a little disappointed.
But she said nothing more and in a minute
Laura heard her roll over and fall asleep. Laura did
not sleep again that night.

Chapter Three
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">f</span> Laura and Marcie went along together on greased
wheels, Marcie and Burr did nothing of the kind.
There was never anything real to argue about. But Burr
couldn’t pick up a book or clear his throat or make a
suggestion without causing a disagreement. And he was
as quick to snap at his ex-wife. The only times they
weren’t shouting at each other, they were kissing each
other.
</p>

<p>
“You probably wonder why we keep seeing each other
when we fight like this,” Marcie said to her one
night.
</p>

<p>
“Do you love each other?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know—Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I guess it doesn’t matter if you fight.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope it doesn’t drive you nuts.”
</p>

<p>
“No, not at all.” Laura wouldn’t even look up from her
book. Marcie embarrassed her with these confidences.
But she couldn’t go on reading. She stared at the page
and waited for Marcie to continue.
</p>

<p>
Marcie couldn’t keep a secret. Things poured out of
her, even intimate things, even things that belonged
to her private soul and should have stayed there. Laura
squirmed to hear her sometimes.
</p>

<p>
“We see each other,” Marcie went on, “because we can’t
keep our hands off each other. We fight because
we’re ashamed of what we want from each other. At
least, I am. I guess Burr doesn’t have any shame. No,
that’s not fair. I guess he’s the one who’s sure he’s in
love. Sometimes I think I am, because I want to keep
seeing him. And other times, I think it’s just his big
broad shoulders.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t see him for a while,” Laura said. “Or try talking
less when you do. See what happens. Or do you just
want to keep torturing yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“I guess I do,” said Marcie with such a disarming
smile that Laura had to smile back.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="25" id="page-25"></a>
“Well, it’s not my business. I can’t pass out any helpful
hints,” Laura said. <em>I won’t care about your personal
life, I can’t</em>, she thought.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed, walking around the room, peeling
off her clothes. “Laura, you’re a funny girl,” she said.
“You’re not like other girls I know.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not?” Laura felt an old near-forgotten sick feeling
come up in her chest.
</p>

<p>
“No. Other girls love to talk about things. They love
to gossip. Why, I know some who would get started on
Burr and keep going until they had to be gagged. But
you’re different. You just sit there and read and think.
Don’t you get worn out doing so much thinking?”
</p>

<p>
“What makes you think I do so much?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t know. Don’t you?”
</p>

<p>
“Everybody thinks.”
</p>

<p>
“Not as much as you do.”
</p>

<p>
“There’s nothing wrong with it.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t mean that. I mean—I guess I mean, why don’t
you ever go out?”
</p>

<p>
“I do. I saw that musical last week.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t mean with me. Or other girls. I mean with
boys.”
</p>

<p>
Laura loathed conversations like these. She felt as if
she had spent her whole life justifying herself to somebody—mostly
Merrill Landon, but others too. As if everything
she did or didn’t do had to be inspected and approved.
If it wasn’t approved it stuck in her craw somewhere
and came up now and then to make her sick. “I’m
new in New York,” she said. “I don’t know anyone yet.”
</p>

<p>
“How about Dr. Carstens? You said he was good-looking.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s married.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, the other one, then?”
</p>

<p>
“He’s practically married.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, how about the big shot?”
</p>

<p>
“He’s a grandfather.” She said it sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
Marcie threw her hands up and laughed. “Laura, I’m
going to have to do something about you.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t do anything about me, please, Marcie.” Something
in the tone of her voice sobered Marcie up.
</p>

<p>
“Why not?” she said.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="26" id="page-26"></a>
“I—I just don’t want to be a bother, that’s all.”
</p>

<p>
“A bother!” Marcie came and sat beside her on the
bed, wearing only the bottoms of a pair of blue jersey
pajamas, cut like slim harem pants. Her breasts were
high and full and unbearably sweet. “Laura, I like you.
We’re living together. We’re friends. I guess I’ve made
a bad impression on you with Burr and everything, but
I want you to know I really like you. You’re no bother.”
She smiled. “I’ll get Burr to fix you up with Jack
Mann. We’ll go somewhere together. We need to get out.
Maybe we’d quit quarreling if we didn’t sit around
this apartment all the time.”
</p>

<p>
She paused, and Laura tried not to look at her.
</p>

<p>
“How about it?” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
Laura was in a familiar situation. She’d been in
it before, she’d be in it again, there was no escaping
it. This is a heterosexual society and everybody plays
the game one way or another. Or pretends to play it for
appearances’ sake.
</p>

<p>
“I’d love to,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“Good! What night?”
</p>

<p>
“Any night.” Laura wanted to shove her off the bed,
to throw the covers at her; anything to cover up her
gleaming bosom. She felt herself go hot and cold by
turns and it exasperated her. She wondered how obvious
it was. But even in her discomfort she knew it
didn’t show as much as it felt. She finally climbed
past Marcie and out of the bed, making a hasty way to
the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll call Burr,” Marcie called after her.
</p>

<p>
Laura closed the bathroom door and leaned heavily
against it, panting, her arms clasped tight around
herself, rocking back and forth, her eyes shut. Spasms
went through her and she shook herself angrily. Her
hands stole downward in spite of herself and suddenly
all her feeling was fixed in one place, clarified, shattering.
There was a moment of suppressed violence when
she clapped one hand over her mouth, helpless in her
own grasp, and her imprisoned mouth murmured,
“Marcie, Marcie, Marcie,” into her hand. And then
came relief, quiet. The trembling ceased, the heaving
breath slowed down. She relaxed utterly, with only just
<a class="pagenum" title="27" id="page-27"></a>
enough strength in her legs to hold her up, depending
on the door to do the rest. “Damn her,” she said in a
faint whisper. “Damn her.” It was the first time she
realized how strong her “friendly” feelings for Marcie
really were and she was dismayed.
</p>

<p>
Laura went quickly to the washbowl and turned on
the tap. She ought to be making some noise. People
don’t disappear into bathrooms for ten minutes in
utter silence. At least not in this bathroom where every
pipe had its own distinct and recognizable scream.
In a few seconds Marcie was calling at her through the
door.
</p>

<p>
“Laura? Can I come in?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course.”
</p>

<p>
“We’re going to make it for Friday. We’ll see a
show.”
</p>

<p>
“That sounds fine.”
</p>

<p>
“It’ll be fun.”
</p>

<p>
<em>I will not look at her</em>, Laura told herself, and buried
her face in a washcloth. She scrubbed herself assiduously
while Marcie chattered. <em>Damn her anyway, I won’t
look at her. She has no claim on me, that was a silly
fool thing I did. I’ll pretend it didn’t happen. It
didn’t happen, it didn’t happen.</em> She was afraid that if
she did look it might happen again. She rinsed her face
slowly and careful in water from the groaning tap, and
still Marcie stood there talking.
</p>

<p>
Laura reached for a towel and dried her face. She hung
the towel up again and turned to walk out of the bathroom,
ready to ignore Marcie. But Marcie had slipped
into pajama tops and looked quite demure. Except for
her extraordinarily pretty face. Laura stared at her, as
she had known she would, as she did more and more
lately.
</p>

<p>
“We’ll take in a show in Greenwich Village, because
it’s easier to get tickets—at least to this one—and besides,
Burr knows—what’s the matter, Laura?”
</p>

<p>
“What? Oh, nothing. Nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“You looked kind of funny.”
</p>

<p>
“Did I? I didn’t mean to. That sounds fine, the
show I mean.” She hurried past Marcie into the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="28" id="page-28"></a>
In bed she cursed herself for an idiot. <em>I’m just an
animal</em>, she berated herself. <em>I hardly know Marcie. I
won’t start feeling this way, I won’t!</em>
</p>

<p>
Out of the past rose the image of another face, a face
serenely lovely, a face whose owner she had loved so desperately
that she had finally been forced to leave school
because of her.
</p>

<p>
<em>Why, they look alike!</em> she thought, startled. <em>Why
didn’t I see it before? I must be blind. They look alike,
they really do.</em> In the dark she pictured Marcie’s face
beside the other, matching, comparing, regretting. It
tore at her heart to see them together. She wished the
morning would never come when she would have to get
up, bright and cheerful and ordinary, like every other
morning, and look at Marcie’s face again. And Marcie’s
breasts.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Morning came, as mornings will, and it went the
same way. It was not intolerable. Laura was secretly on
guard against Marcie now. Or rather, on guard against
herself. She wasn’t going to fall. Marcie loved a man—men,
anyway—and Laura wasn’t in any hurry to go
through hell with her.
</p>

<p>
A curious change had come over Laura since the
days of the terrible, and wonderful, college romance with
a girl named Beth. She had been so frightened then, so
lost, so completely dependent on Beth. She had no courage,
except what Beth gave her; no strength except
through Beth; no will but Beth’s. She had loved her slavishly;
adored her. And when Beth left her for a man,
when she told Laura it had never been real love for her
at all, Laura was wounded clear through her heart.
</p>

<p>
All these things were unknown to Merrill Landon;
unknown and unsuspected. They would remain forever
in the dark corners of Laura’s mind, where she heaped
her old hurts and fears.
</p>

<p>
She had thought of killing herself when she left school
and went home to face her father. But she was young and
her youth worked against such thoughts. Perhaps the very
fact that she had loved so deeply and so well prevented
her. She had learned to need love too much to think seriously
about death.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="29" id="page-29"></a>
Beth had left scars on Laura. But she had been a good
teacher too, and some of the things she taught her lover
were beginning to assert themselves, now that Laura
was on her own and time was softening the pain. Laura
walked tall. She felt tall. It wasn’t the simple physical
fact of her height. It was a curious self-respect born of
the humiliation of her love. Beth had taught Laura
to look within herself, and what she found was a revelation.

Chapter Four
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> following evening Laura got home rather early
after seeing a show with Sarah. She rode home on the
subway with a dirty gray little man, repulsively anxious
to be friendly. He kept saying, “I see you’re not
married. You must be very careful in the big city.”
And laughed nervously. Laura turned away. “You mustn’t
ignore me, I’m only trying to help,” he whined. He
babbled at her about young lambs in a den of wolves
until she got off. He got off with her, still talking.
</p>

<p>
Laura wasn’t afraid—just mad. She turned suddenly
on the little gray man at the subway entrance and said,
“Leave me alone or I’ll call the police.”
</p>

<p>
He smiled apologetically and began to mumble.
Laura’s eyes narrowed and she turned away contemptuously,
walking with a sure swift gait that soon discouraged
him. Something proud and cold in her unmanned
him. At last he stopped following and stood
gaping after her. She never looked back.
</p>

<p>
Laura arrived home, her cheeks warm with the quick
walk <a id="corr-1"></a>and with the victory over the little man. <em>God, if I could
do that to my father!</em> she thought wistfully. She walked
up the flight of stairs from the twelfth floor to the penthouse
and swung open the front door. The living room
was lighted and so was the kitchen. The bedroom door
was open, the room showing a cool blue beyond the loud
yellow kitchen. Laura walked in, swinging her purse, thinking
of the ugly little man and proud of the way she had
trounced him.
</p>

<p>
She stopped short with a gasp at the sight of Burr and
Marcie naked together in Marcie’s bed. “I’m sorry!” she
exclaimed, and backed out, closing the door behind her.
She collapsed on a kitchen chair and cried in furious disgust
for half a minute. Then she stood up and went to
the refrigerator, pretending to want a glass of milk just
<a class="pagenum" title="31" id="page-31"></a>
for an excuse to move, to ignore the hot silence in the next
room.
</p>

<p>
For a while no sounds issued from the bedroom. Laura
poured the milk busily and carried it into the living room.
She was just putting a record on when the bedroom door
opened and Marcie slipped out in her bathrobe. Laura
had put her milk down. Just the sight of it was enough to
make her feel green. She turned to Marcie.
</p>

<p>
“Hi,” she said, too brightly. “Sorry I had to go and
break in.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie burst out laughing. “That’s okay. Damn him, I
<em>told</em> him to go home. I knew you’d get home early. I just
had a feeling.” She went up to Laura, still laughing, and
Laura turned petulantly away. Marcie didn’t notice. “We
took your advice, Laura,” she said. “We haven’t said a
word to each other tonight. Well—I said when he came
in—‘All right, we’re not going to argue. Don’t open your
mouth. Not one word.’ And he didn’t. He didn’t even
say hello!” And her musical laughter tickled Laura insufferably.
</p>

<p>
Burr came out of the bedroom, looking rather sheepish,
rather sleepy, very satisfied. He smiled at Laura, who had
to force herself to wear a pleasant face. He was buttoning
his shirt, carrying his coat over his arm, and all he said
was, “Thanks, Laura.” He grinned, thumbing at Marcie.
“We’re not speaking. I hear it was your idea.” He swatted
Laura’s behind. “Good girl,” he said. He kissed Marcie
once more, hard, drew on his coat, and backed out the
door, still smiling.
</p>

<p>
Marcie whirled around and around in the middle of
the living room, hugging herself and laughing hilariously.
“If it could always be like that,” she said. “I’d marry him
again tomorrow.”
</p>

<p>
Laura brushed past her without a word, into the
kitchen, where she poured the milk carefully back into the
bottle, closed the refrigerator door, went into the bedroom,
and got ready for bed.
</p>

<p>
Marcie followed her, laughing and talking until Laura
got into bed and turned out the light. She wouldn’t even
look at Marcie’s rumpled bed. But it haunted her,
and she didn’t fall asleep until long after Marcie had
stopped whispering.

<p class="noindent">
Jack Mann was small, physically tough, and very intelligent.
He was a sort of cocktail-hour cynic, disillusioned
enough with things to be cuttingly funny. If you like that
kind of wit. Some people don’t. The attitude carried over
into his everyday life, but he saved his best wit especially
for the after work hours, when the first fine careless flush
of alcohol gave it impetus. Unfortunately he usually gave
himself too much impetus and went staggering home to
his bachelor apartment under the arm of a grumbling
friend. He was a draftsman in the office where Burr
worked as an apprentice architect and he called his work
“highly skilled labor.” He didn’t like it. But he did like the
pay.
</p>

<p>
“Why do you do it, then?” Burr asked him once.
</p>

<p>
“It’s the only thing I know. But I’d much rather dig
ditches.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, hell, go dig ditches then. Nobody’s stopping you.”
</p>

<p>
Jack could turn his wit on himself as well as on others.
“I can’t,” he told Burr. “I’m so used to sitting on my can
all day I’d be lucky to get one lousy ditch dug. And then
they’d probably have to bury me in it. End of a beautiful
career.”
</p>

<p>
Burr smiled and shook his head. But he liked him; they
got along. Jack went out with Burr and Marcie before
and after they got married. And after they got divorced.
He was the trouble-shooter until he got too drunk,
which was often.
</p>

<p>
When he arrived with Burr on Friday night Laura was
irked to find that she was taller than he was. She had
made up her mind that she wasn’t going to enjoy the
evening—just live through it. She’d have to spend the
time mediating for Marcie and Burr and trying to entertain
a man she didn’t know or care about. So she was put
out to discover that she did like Jack, after all. It ruined
her fine gloomy mood.
</p>

<p>
Marcie introduced them and Jack looked up at her quizzically.
“What’s the matter, Landon?” he said. “You standing
in a hole?”
</p>

<p>
Laura laughed and took her shoes off. It brought her
down an inch. “Better?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Better for me. Very bad for your stockings.” He
grinned. “Have you read Freud?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="33" id="page-33"></a>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, thank God. I won’t have to talk about my nightmares.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you have nightmares?”
</p>

<p>
“You <em>have</em> read Freud!”
</p>

<p>
“No, I swear. You said—”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, I confess. I have nightmares. And you remind
me of my mother.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you have a mother?” said Burr. “Didn’t you just
happen?”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what I keep asking my analyst. Do I have to
have a mother?”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, are you seeing an analyst?” Marcie was fascinated
with the idea. “Imagine being able to tell somebody
<em>everything</em>. Like a sacred duty. Burr, don’t you think
I should be analyzed?”
</p>

<p>
“What will you use for a neurosis?” Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
“Do I need one?”
</p>

<p>
“How about Burr?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m taken,” Burr said. “Besides, you talk like a nitwit,
honey. You don’t go to an analyst like you go to the hairdresser.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie’s eyes flashed. “Thanks for the compliment,” she
said. “I’m not as dumb as I look.”
</p>

<p>
“Come on, Mother.” Jack took Laura’s arm and steered
her out the door. “I see a storm coming up.”
</p>

<p>
But it was dissipated when Marcie grabbed her coat
and hurried after them.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
After the play they walked down Fourth Street in the
Village, meandering rather aimlessly, looking into shop
windows. Laura was lost. She had never been in the Village
before. She had been afraid to come down here;
afraid she would see someone, and do something, and
suddenly find herself caught in the strange world she had
renounced. It seemed so safe, so remote from temptation to
choose an uptown apartment. And yet here she was with
her nerves in knots, her emotions tangled around a roommate
again.
</p>

<p>
Laura pondered these things, walking slowly beside
Jack in the light from the shop windows. She was unaware
of where she walked or who passed by. It startled her
<a class="pagenum" title="34" id="page-34"></a>
when Jack said, “What are you thinking about, Mother?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing.” A shade of irritation crossed her face.
</p>

<p>
“Ah,” he said. “I interrupted something.”
</p>

<p>
“No.” She turned to look at him, uncomfortable. He
made her feel as if he was reading her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t lie to me. You’re daydreaming.”
</p>

<p>
“I am not! I’m just thinking.”
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. “Same thing.”
</p>

<p>
She found him very irritating then. “You don’t say,”
she said, and looked away from him.
</p>

<p>
“You hate me,” he said with a little smile.
</p>

<p>
“Now and then.”
</p>

<p>
“I messed up your daydream,” he said. “I’m rarely this
offensive. Only when I’m sober. The rest of the time, I’m
charming. Someday I suppose you’ll daydream about me.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
“At least, you’ll tell me about your daydreams.”
</p>

<p>
“Never.”
</p>

<p>
“People do. I have a nice face. Ugly, but nice. People
think, ‘Jesus, that guy has a nice face. I ought to tell him
my daydreams.’ They do, too.” He smiled. “What’s the
matter, Mother, you look skeptical.”
</p>

<p>
“What makes you think you have a nice face?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t I?” He looked genuinely alarmed.
</p>

<p>
“It wouldn’t appeal to just anyone.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, smart girl. You’re right, as usual. A boy’s best
friend is his mother. Only the <em>discriminating</em> ones, my
girl, think it’s a nice face. Only the sensitive, the talented,
the intelligent. Now tell me—isn’t it a nice face?”
</p>

<p>
“It’s a face,” said Laura. “Everybody has one.”
</p>

<p>
He laughed. “You’re goofy,” he said. “You need help.
My analyst is very reasonable. He’ll stick you for all
you’ve got, but he’s very reasonable.”
</p>

<p>
Burr, who was walking ahead of them with Marcie,
turned around to demand, “Somebody tell me where I’m
going.”
</p>

<p>
“Turn right at the next corner,” said Jack. “You’re
doing fine, boy. Don’t lose your nerve.”
</p>

<p>
“I just want to know where the hell I’m going.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s a bad sign. Very bad.”
</p>

<p>
“Cut it out, Jack,” said Marcie. “Where are we going?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="35" id="page-35"></a>
“A little bar I know. Very gay. I go there alone when I
want to be depressed.”
</p>

<p>
It sounded sinister, not gay, to Laura. “What’s it
called?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“The Cellar. Don’t worry, it’s a legitimate joint.” He
laughed at her long face.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed too, and Laura’s heart jumped at the
sweetness of the sound. It made her hate the back
of Burr, moving with big masculine easiness ahead of her
in a tweed topcoat, his bristling crew cut shining.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later Jack led them down a few steps
to a pair of doors which he pushed in, letting Laura and
Marcie pass.
</p>

<p>
Laura heard Burr say, behind her, in an undertone, “It
<em>is</em> gay,” and he laughed. “You bastard.” She was mystified.
It looked pretty average and ordinary. They headed
for a table with four chairs, one of the few available, and
Laura looked around.
</p>

<p>
The Cellar was quite dark, with the only lights placed
over the bar and glowing a faint pinky orange. There were
candles on the tables, and people crowded together from
one end of the room to the other. Everybody seemed reasonably
cheerful, but it didn’t look any gayer than
any other bar she had been in. She looked curiously at
Burr, but he was helping Marcie out of her coat.
</p>

<p>
“No table service,” Jack said. “What does everybody
want?”
</p>

<p>
They gave him their orders and Laura tried to catch his
eye, hoping for more information about the place. She
was curious now. There were checkered table cloths, fish
nets on the wall, a lot of people—all rather young—at
the tables and bar. The juke box was going and somebody
was trying to pick up a few bucks doing pencil portraits,
but no one seemed very interested. The customers looked
like students. There were girls in cotton pants, young men
in sweaters and open-collared shirts.
</p>

<p>
“They all look like students,” she said to Burr.
</p>

<p>
He grinned. “I never thought of it that way,” he said.
“I guess they do, all right.”
</p>

<p>
She stared at him. And then she looked around the
room again, and suddenly she saw a girl with her arm
around another girl at a table not far away. Her heart
<a class="pagenum" title="36" id="page-36"></a>
jumped. A pair of boys at the bar were whispering urgently
to each other.
</p>

<p>
<em>Gay</em>, Laura thought to herself. <em>Is that what they call it?
Gay?</em> She was acutely uncomfortable now. It was as if she
were a child of civilization, reared among the savages,
who suddenly found herself among the civilized. She recognized
them as her own. And yet she had adopted the
habits of another race and she was embarrassed and lost
with her own kind.
</p>

<p>
They looked at her—her own kind—from the bar and
from the tables, and didn’t recognize her. And Laura
looked around at them and thought, <em>I’m one of you. Help
me.</em> But if anyone had approached her she would have
turned away.
</p>

<p>
Jack came back with the drinks and sat down, passing
them around. He drank a shot of whisky and said to
Laura, “Well? How do you like tonight’s collection?”
</p>

<p>
“Tonight’s collection of what?” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“Of nuts.” He looked around The Cellar. “Doesn’t anyone
tell you anything, Mother? Burr, what’s the matter
with you? She’s a tourist. Make with the old travelogue,
boy.”
</p>

<p>
Burr laughed. “I thought you didn’t get it, Laura.” He
smiled. “They’re all queer.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s face went scarlet, but the candlelight hid it. She
felt an awful tide of anger and fear come up in her at that
word. She felt trapped, almost frantic, and she vented it
on Jack. “Why didn’t you tell me?” she said. Her voice
trembled with indignation.
</p>

<p>
“Take it easy, Mother,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Tonight’s collection!” she mimicked bitterly. “You talk
about them as if they were a bunch of animals.”
</p>

<p>
“They are,” he said quietly. “So are we.”
</p>

<p>
“We’re human beings,” she said. “We have no
right to sit here and laugh at them for something they
can’t help.”
</p>

<p>
“Can’t help, hell,” Burr said, leaning over the table toward
her. “All those gals need is a real man. That’d put
them on the right track in a hurry.”
</p>

<p>
Laura could have belted him. She wanted to shout,
“How do you know, you big ape?” But she said instead,
“You’re not irresistible, Burr.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="37" id="page-37"></a>
“I don’t mean that!” he said, frowning at her. “Christ!
I only mean a man who knows the first thing about
women could lay any one of these dames—even a butch—and
make her like it.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s the first thing about women?” Jack asked,
smiling, but they ignored him.
</p>

<p>
“If men revolt her and somebody tried to—to lay her—he’d
only make her sick. No matter how much he
knew about women,” Laura said sharply.
</p>

<p>
“Any girl who doesn’t like men is either a virgin or else
some bastard scared the hell out of her. She needs gentling.”
</p>

<p>
“You talk about us as if we were horses!” Laura flared.
</p>

<p>
“Us?” Burr stared at her.
</p>

<p>
“Us—us women.” Laura’s face was burning.
</p>

<p>
Burr watched her as he talked. “Some girls get a bastard
the first time,” he said. “It’s too bad. They end up
in joints like this swapping horror stories with the other
ones.”
</p>

<p>
Laura hated the way he talked. She couldn’t take it.
“What if the bastard is her father?” she said. “And he
scares the hell out of her when she’s five years old?
And twenty years later some ass who thinks he’s a great
lover comes along and throws her down and humiliates
and horrifies her?”
</p>

<p>
Jack remarked, with amusement, and probably more enlightenment
than the others, “Jesus, we have a moralist
in our midst.” He looked at her as if she were a new
species of fish.
</p>

<p>
“Damn it, Laura, that’s the point,” Burr said. “He
<em>wouldn’t</em> humiliate her. I don’t mean some God-damn
truck driver with nothing but a quick lay on his mind. I
mean a considerate decent sort of guy—a sort of Good
Samaritan—” He grinned and Marcie said, “God!” and
rolled her eyes to the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
“—who really wants to help the girl,” Burr finished.
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you try it?” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
Marcie’s face darkened. “Yes, darling, why don’t you
prove your little theory? I’m sure we’d all be fascinated.”
</p>

<p>
“Now damn it, don’t you go yammering at me. I’m
talking to Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Excuse <em>me</em>!” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="38" id="page-38"></a>
Laura leaned toward her. “I didn’t mean to start anything,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“Nobody ever does,” Jack remarked to himself.
</p>

<p>
“He said he could lay any girl and make her like it,”
Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“I said,” Burr said, turning to her and intoning sarcastically,
“That any guy with any—”
</p>

<p>
“We know what you said, boy,” Jack interrupted. “Let’s
keep it purely theoretical. Nobody has to prove anything.
Burr loves Marcie and Marcie loves Burr. Jack loves whisky
and whisky hates Jack. Laura loves animals. Everybody
happy?”
</p>

<p>
Thinking over what she had said while Jack talked,
Laura began to feel sick. She wished she had been perceptive
enough to see where she was when they first came
into The Cellar. But she took things at face value. They
had entered a little bar and they were going to have a
nightcap. Okay. What was so sinister about that? Why did
it have to turn out to be a damn gay bar? And why
did she have to react like an angry virgin when she found
out?
</p>

<p>
They stayed long enough to get pretty high. They were
stared at by the regular customers, but Laura was afraid
to stare back. When she did, once or twice, she couldn’t
catch anyone’s eye. She was ashamed of herself for trying
to, but she couldn’t help it.
</p>

<p>
There was a girl at the bar, standing at one end, in
black pants and a white shirt open at the collar. Her hair
was short and dark and there once again was that troubling
resemblance to Beth. There were some other people
with her and they were all talking, but the short-haired
girl seemed somehow apart from them. Now and then she
would turn and smile at one of them and say a word or
two. Then she turned her gaze back to the bar or into her
drink, or just stared into the mirror behind the bar without
seeing anything.
</p>

<p>
Laura glanced at her now and then. She had an interesting
face. It made Laura want to talk to her. <em>It must
be the drinks</em>, she thought, and refused another.
</p>

<p>
“I see by the look in your eye,” Jack said, “that you’ve
had enough of this place. It’s nearly midnight. Are you
going to turn into a pumpkin?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="39" id="page-39"></a>
“God, I hope not,” said Laura.
</p>

<p>
“It’s <em>after</em> midnight,” said Marcie. “Let’s go. After all,
poor Burr had to get up at six this morning to get to work.
He’s probably exhausted. Maybe we should leave him
here and let him organize a night school for the ladies.”
</p>

<p>
“Wouldn’t be any takers in here,” Jack observed, looking
around. “They aren’t ladies, they’re lessies.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you have to talk about them as if they were exhibits
in a zoo?” Laura exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“God, now <em>we’re</em> quarreling,” said Jack, laughing. But
they weren’t really, for it takes two to make a quarrel and
he was feeling powerfully good-natured with all that booze
in him. “Leave us not forget our dignity,” he told Laura.
He enunciated with meticulous care, not to let the liquor
trip his tongue.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed at him, and pulled Laura aside as
they got up. “Let’s go,” she said, and Laura walked with
her to the ladies’ room. It was a glaring change from the
softly lighted Cellar. They were nearly blinded with a big
bare bulb which hung by a frayed wire far down into the
room and watched all the proceedings with an unblinking
eye.
</p>

<p>
“You go first,” Laura said to Marcie. There were
few things less appealing to her than a public rest room—especially
a one-horse job like this with its staring
light, cracked mirror and mounds of used paper towels
on the cement floor. She wet her comb slightly in the tap
and ran it through her hair. The door opened and the
girl with the short dark hair and black pants came in.
She lounged indolently against the wall, studying
Laura. Laura recognized her from the bar, but ignored
her royally. Marcie was talking to her through the john
door.
</p>

<p>
“How do you like Jack?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“A lot,” Laura said, for the benefit of the girl in the
black pants. Her voice was warm enough to surprise
Marcie.
</p>

<p>
“I’m glad,” she said. “I thought once or twice you were
mad at him.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s cheeks went red again. God, how she hated
that! And there was nothing she could do about it. She
pulled the comb hard through her hair, afraid to look
<a class="pagenum" title="40" id="page-40"></a>
into the mirror. She knew she would meet the eyes of the
girl in the black pants. “He’s very intelligent,” she said
to Marcie.
</p>

<p>
“He’s funny,” Marcie said, coming out of the john. She
nearly walked into the strange girl and said, “Oh! Excuse
me.”
</p>

<p>
“My pleasure,” the girl murmured with a grin.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt suddenly jealous. It was maddening. She
didn’t know who she was jealous of. She wanted the other
girl to notice <em>her</em>, not Marcie. And she wanted Marcie
to notice her, too. She stood a moment in confusion and
then she said to the girl in the black pants, “Go ahead.”
And nodded at the john. She said it to make her look up,
which she did, slowly, and smiled. She looked shockingly
boyish. Laura stared slightly.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks,” said the girl.
</p>

<p>
She shut the door behind her and Marcie laughed silently,
covering her mouth with her hand. But Laura
turned away, excitement tight in her throat. “Let’s go,”
she said impatiently, dragging Marcie away from the mirror.
She was afraid the strange girl would come out and
talk to them. She was anxious to get out of The Cellar,
out of the Village. She felt a pressing sense of danger.
</p>

<p>
Marcie turned to her as they went back to the table, and
said, “I’ll bet Burr couldn’t have gotten anywhere with
<em>that</em> one!” And she laughed. “She’d throw a hammer lock
on him and tell him to pick on somebody his own size.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled faintly at her.
</p>

<p>
“Did you see how she stared at you?” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“Did she stare at me?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but she stared at me too. That’s the awful thing
about Lesbians, they have no discrimination.”
</p>

<p>
Laura suddenly wanted to scream at her. It was so
wrong, so false; so agonizing to have your lips sealed when
you wanted to shout the truth.
</p>

<p>
They left the smoky Cellar and walked a few blocks,
talking. Jack took a weaving course, and Laura had to
steer him with one arm.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s take a taxi,” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“It’s only two blocks to the subway,” Burr reminded her.
</p>

<p>
“Can’t you ever spend a little extra on me?” she exclaimed.
“Don’t you think I’m good enough to ride in a
<a class="pagenum" title="41" id="page-41"></a>
taxi? Don’t you think I’m worth another buck once in a
while? You did when we got married.”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah, and I went broke. Subway’s cheap.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I’m not!”
</p>

<p>
“Here, here,” said Jack. He took a quarter from his
pocket and held it up to Marcie’s face.
</p>

<p>
“Heads,” she said.
</p>

<p>
He flipped while Laura thought to herself what child’s
play it all was. Jack seemed unsophisticated now and
Marcie and Burr had lost the beauty and excitement they
seemed to generate together, even in the midst of their
quarrels, perhaps because of them. <em>We all look tired and
silly</em>, Laura thought, <em>and I wish we were anywhere but the
middle of Greenwich Village flipping over a taxi ride</em>.
</p>

<p>
“Heads!” said Marcie. She poked Burr in the stomach.
</p>

<p>
“No show next week,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t think I care, do you?”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind, children, this is my treat,” said Jack. He
smiled foxily. “I’m no fool with money,” he said. “I grow
it in my window box. I give it all to Mother, here, and
she invests it for me. Don’t you, Mother?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be an ass,” said Laura, but she laughed at him.
</p>

<p>
“She loves me,” Jack explained to Burr and Marcie. Suddenly
he left them all to dash into the middle of the
street, waving his arms wildly at a pair of headlights
that were bearing down on him. They screeched to a halt
with an irate taxi driver behind them. Marcie gave a little
scream and the driver leaned out and said, “You damn
fool!”
</p>

<p>
“You’d better get that punk home and give him some
black coffee, lady,” he told Laura as they started uptown.
“If you don’t mind a little advice.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s going to hate himself tomorrow,” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“He’s damn lucky he’s gonna be <em>around</em> tomorrow,” said
the cabbie. They all talked about him as if he were deaf.
And in fact, he was, for he had fallen asleep almost as
soon as he got into the cab.
</p>

<p>
“Does he do this all the time?” Laura asked Burr.
</p>

<p>
“He’s a great guy, Laura,” Burr said, as if trying to
bolster Jack in Laura’s eyes. “He just flies off the handle
now and then. I guess he’s got problems.”
</p>

<p>
At the apartment Laura got out first. Burr said, “I’ll
<a class="pagenum" title="42" id="page-42"></a>
wake him up, Laura,” but she protested. “Just let him
sleep,” she said. “I’d hate to interrupt his dreams.”
</p>

<p>
“I heard that,” said a ragged voice from the shadows
inside the car. “You’re a doll, Mother. Sleep well.”
</p>

<p>
“Goodnight,” Laura said, smiling.

Chapter Five

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> was under the covers and almost asleep when Marcie
tiptoed in after bidding Burr goodnight. She moved
around the room for a few minutes, getting ready for
bed. Laura was just barely aware of her. After a little
while she heard her turn the light off and cuddle the
covers around herself. The silence, up above the city late
at night, was deep, lulling, almost country-like. Only an
occasional stray horn filtered up to their level. It sounded
like a far-off echo.
</p>

<p>
“Laura? Are you asleep?” Marcie whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh.” She was quiet for a minute. Then she whispered,
“I have to ask you something.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t marry him. It’ll never work.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I don’t mean that. I mean—does it make you feel
funny to see those people?”
</p>

<p>
“What people?”
</p>

<p>
“Queers?”
</p>

<p>
“They aren’t queer, Marcie. That’s a cruel word.” Her
eyes were wide open now in the dark.
</p>

<p>
“What are they, then?”
</p>

<p>
“Homosexuals.” She said it shyly.
</p>

<p>
“That’s too long. Well, <em>does</em> it make you feel funny?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know what you mean, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I mean like the butch in the ladies’ room. Didn’t
she make you feel queer—I mean funny—” She laughed.
“—looking at us like she was a man, or something?”
</p>

<p>
“I guess so.”
</p>

<p>
“She was looking at us when she was at the bar, too.”
</p>

<p>
“She was?” Laura was amazed that Marcie would notice
such a thing. “How do you know?”
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed again. “I was looking at her,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“You what?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, not the way you think. I was just sort of looking
around and she was looking at our table. I think she
<a class="pagenum" title="44" id="page-44"></a>
wanted to come up and talk to us but she didn’t dare
with the boys there. She knew we weren’t gay.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that what they call it—gay?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. You know, it gave me the funniest feeling, her
staring at us like that.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned over in her bed, very wide awake. She
said to herself, <em>I won’t ask her about it</em>, but she couldn’t
help asking. “What sort of feeling?” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Well, it was like ... if I tell you you won’t think I’m
like <em>them</em>, will you?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no! Of course not.” Laura felt the blood beating in
her throat.
</p>

<p>
“It was like I wanted to know what she’d do to me. If
we were alone, I mean. I was sort of curious. I wondered
what it would feel like. Not that I’d ever let a girl—I
mean—Laura, did you ever kiss a girl?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” Laura said. In the dark she could lie pretty well.
Her blushing cheeks didn’t show.
</p>

<p>
“I did, once.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands to her throat and tried to still her
breathing. “Did you like it?” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Not much. But I didn’t dislike it. I was at that age.
She was a friend of mine in Junior High. Maybe she
turned out queer. I mean homosexual. She probably thinks
<em>I</em> turned out queer,” and she laughed. “She was always
wanting to touch tongues.”
</p>

<p>
Laura shivered. “Did you?”
</p>

<p>
“A couple of times. It gave me the creeps. With a man
it’s so lovely.” Laura heard her turn in her bed to face
her. “Didn’t you ever do that when you were little? We
used to do it a lot, just because it felt so awful. But
Lenore was always wanting to do it with me when we
got older. We were sort of best friends for a while.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was sitting up, shivering, on the edge of her bed.
She thought, <em>Dear God, if there is a God, help me now.
Don’t let me touch her. Please don’t let me.</em>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Marcie got up and crossed the small aisle between
the beds. She felt Laura and sat beside her. “Stick
out your tongue,” she commanded, giggling.
</p>

<p>
“No!”
</p>

<p>
“Come on. I want to feel twelve years old again. I feel
silly. Stick your tongue out.” She was teasing and Laura
<a class="pagenum" title="45" id="page-45"></a>
could see the flash of gold hair in the moonlight that
struck them from the window by the bed.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, don’t do this! Don’t! You’re playing with fire.
Please, this is crazy.” But her voice dwindled to a whisper
as Marcie took her face in her hands, and she was powerless
to resist. She let herself be pulled toward Marcie, felt
Marcie’s soft wet tongue searching for her own. Laura
opened her mouth with a slight gasp. Her arms went out
to grasp Marcie’s slender body as a groan escaped
her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the phone rang. Laura gave a little scream of
shock. They were both utterly silent and motionless until
it rang again. Then Marcie began to laugh. “Oh, wouldn’t
you know!” she said. “Saved by the bell. Saved from a life
of sin.” The phone rang again. “I’ll get it,” Marcie said.
She sprang up from the bed. Laura sat frozen where she
was, hugging herself, trembling and miserable. “It’s probably
Burr wanting to apologize for being such a skunk,”
Marcie said. She threw herself across her bed and lifted
the receiver. “Hello? ... Laura, it’s for you.” She put her
hand over the mouthpiece and said, “It’s Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to talk to him.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be silly. Talk to him.”
</p>

<p>
Unwillingly Laura took the phone, sitting on the bed
beside Marcie. She was so conscious of Marcie’s body
stretched out there beside her that she had trouble concentrating
on Jack.
</p>

<p>
He said, “Mother, I’ve been an ass.”
</p>

<p>
“I know.”
</p>

<p>
“Forgive me.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re forgiven,” she said. “Now go to bed. Goodnight.”
</p>

<p>
“But I am in bed,” he said. He was still pronouncing
each word with elaborate care. “My question is this—did
you really mean it?”
</p>

<p>
“Mean what?” said Laura looking at the faint moonlit
curve of Marcie’s leg.
</p>

<p>
“I’d swear you said you loved me,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“You were dreaming.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you?”
</p>

<p>
“No. Jack, please go to bed. Let me go.”
</p>

<p>
“If I went any more to bed than I already am, Mother—and
<a class="pagenum" title="46" id="page-46"></a>
don’t think that was easy to say, because it wasn’t—I
don’t know where I’d be. Say you love me.”
</p>

<p>
“No. Jack, it’s late. I’m tired.”
</p>

<p>
“Tomorrow is Saturday. You can sleep.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t care what tomorrow is, I’m tired right now.
Now goodnight.”
</p>

<p>
“Do something for me, Mother.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie turned over, lying across her pillow on her stomach.
</p>

<p>
“What?” Laura said softly, losing contact with him.
</p>

<p>
“Promise.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay.” She whispered it.
</p>

<p>
“Kiss Marcie for me.”
</p>

<p>
“<em>What?</em>” Laura was shocked into total awareness.
</p>

<p>
“Goodnight, Mother,” Jack said. And hung up.
</p>

<p>
Laura replaced the receiver and sat uncertainly on the
bed next to Marcie for a minute. She didn’t dare to wonder
what Jack meant. She had enough to do just keeping
her hands off Marcie’s smooth behind. She felt afraid
of her.
</p>

<p>
<em>What would Beth have done if it had been me lying
there?</em> she wondered, and knew at once. Beth would have
laid down on top of her, her front to Marcie’s back. Beth
would have kissed her neck, her ears, her shoulders. Beth
would have—
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” Marcie murmured.
</p>

<p>
“Yes?” Her throat was dry, making it hard to answer.
</p>

<p>
“We’d better get to sleep.”
</p>

<p>
It was all over, then. Laura had waited too long. Maybe
Marcie would have repulsed her anyway. Maybe her hesitation
had saved her. On the other hand, maybe—Laura
burned to know. But Marcie had lost the playful, childish,
experimental mood, and was already half asleep. There
might never be another chance.

Chapter Six
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> work on Monday Laura’s phone rang halfway
through the morning. “Doctors Hollingsworth, Carstens,
and Hagstrom,” she said, business-like. What a mouthful!
she thought to herself.
</p>

<p>
Her listener apparently had the same idea. “Jesus, what
a tongue-twister,” he said. “What happened to Smith?”
</p>

<p>
“There is no Dr. Smith,” she said, taken aback.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, don’t be so damn formal, Mother. It’s not like
you. I thought I’d better apologize while I’m sober. I was
drunk the last time.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. How are you, Jack?” She smiled at the thought
of his face.
</p>

<p>
“Bored. But healthy. I didn’t mean to fall asleep in your
face Friday night.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s okay. Forget it.”
</p>

<p>
“Just for that I’ll give you a free ticket to see my
analyst. He’s a great guy. He needs you.”
</p>

<p>
“He needs me?”
</p>

<p>
“Have you got fifty bucks a week to spend on your salvation?”
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t got fifty bucks a week to spend on my
<em>groceries</em>,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I guess he doesn’t need you as much as I thought.
But I’d be glad to stake you to your first session. After
that it becomes habitual. You crave it. You’ll find the
money somehow.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was laughing. “Give it to Marcie, not me,” she
said. “She’s the one who loves to talk.”
</p>

<p>
“You do some pretty good talking yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“I do?”
</p>

<p>
“You got lyrical in defense of oddballs Friday night.”
</p>

<p>
“I did not! Let’s not go into that again anyway,” she
said. “Look, Jack, I’d like to talk to you, but—”
</p>

<p>
“I know, you’re at work. So am I. Don’t you ever get
tired of work?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="48" id="page-48"></a>
“I’m on probation here. If I don’t do well they’ll fire
me in June.”
</p>

<p>
“So your poor virtuous hardworking little life revolves
around that office.”
</p>

<p>
“Now you’re being an ass again.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m telling you, Laura, you’d make a good soap opera.
So would the rest of us. We’re all a bunch of nuts in a
million nutsy little soap operas. Will Burr marry Marcie?
Will Jack take the pledge? Will Laura stick it out till
June? Tune in tomorrow. We won’t have the answer for
you, but we’ll sell you soap like all hell. Do you know
why people buy soap?”
</p>

<p>
“To wash themselves.”
</p>

<p>
“No. They like to play with themselves in the bathtub.”
</p>

<p>
Laura had to laugh at him. “You fool,” she said. “Jack,
I can’t talk to you, honestly.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay. I’ll call back.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no<a id="corr-2"></a>, call tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“But I want to see you tonight.”
</p>

<p>
She was unaware that she might have impressed him
on their date, and he took her by surprise. “You do?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, don’t sound so damn shocked. You’re a nice girl
even if you are ten feet tall. I’ll pick you up at seven-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I can’t, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, eight.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m busy.”
</p>

<p>
“The hell you are.”
</p>

<p>
“I am.”
</p>

<p>
“You lie! I have an instinct about these things. Eight
sharp.”
</p>

<p>
All at once Laura became aware of another voice calling
her. “Laura?” It was Dr. Hollingsworth. He was standing
over her desk and she looked up suddenly like a scared
little kid.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, sir?” she said. She hung up without even saying
goodby to Jack.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Jack Mann was not a pushy type. On the contrary, he was
rather shy, although it rarely showed. He went to parties
and hid behind a stream of wisecracks. He did the same
thing on dates. He did it with anyone and everyone. It
<a class="pagenum" title="49" id="page-49"></a>
was a sort of defense mechanism, a way of hiding his real
self, and he had done it for so many years that by now
it was second nature. Even people who knew him fairly
well, like Burr and Marcie, never saw beneath this facade
of witticism. They thought that <em>was</em> Jack: all funny asides
and not much serious straight talk. It was hard to take
him seriously. He didn’t want that. He wanted to be
laughed at, to be amusing, and he usually contrived to be.
He was content to let people take him for a wag.
</p>

<p>
But once in a while he ran across somebody who made
him feel sick of the mask he hid behind. Somebody who
made him yearn to talk, quietly and seriously, about the
things that mattered to him. It happened when he was unlucky
enough to fall in love. Or when he met a loner like
himself and felt an unspoken sympathy. It happened with
Laura.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t easy for him to call her back. It would have
been, if she hadn’t appealed to his emotions. There were a
lot of girls he called just for the sake of their mutual
amusement, or just to amuse himself. But if he bantered
lightly with Laura it was more because he couldn’t help it
than because he wanted to, more because he had found it
almost impossible to talk straight anymore.
</p>

<p>
At eight o’clock he showed up at the apartment. He
walked into the living room without knocking and said,
“It’s me.” When nobody answered he wandered through
to the bedroom and found Laura giving Marcie a home
permanent. “God, what a stink!” he said.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up in surprise. “I thought you were kidding,”
she said. “About the date.”
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her. She was dressed in tight chinos and a
boy’s shirt. It was her favorite after work outfit. “You
weren’t planning on the Stork Club, I see,” he cracked.
</p>

<p>
“I wasn’t planning on anything.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s a dangerous attitude, Mother. Always plan
on something. Avoid accidents.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, you can’t have her,” Marcie said. “I’ll never
get this thing right without her.” She waved a plastic
curler at him helplessly.
</p>

<p>
“You’re better off without it, doll. Take it from me.
Come on, we’ll go as you are.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I can’t. I had no idea—”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="50" id="page-50"></a>
“Come on. I want to talk to you.”
</p>

<p>
“We can talk here.”
</p>

<p>
“No we can’t. Marcie’s here.”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t listen,” Marcie said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
“Besides, I can’t talk,” he said, and Laura caught a
glimpse of the shyness hidden in him. “I’m sober as
a post.” He shrugged. “Let’s go.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t go like this.”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind the pants, they’re becoming.”
</p>

<p>
For some deep buried and curious reason she was flattered.
She stood there hesitating and Jack took advantage
of her. He grabbed her arm and pulled her toward
the door.
</p>

<p>
“Kidnapper!” Marcie wailed.
</p>

<p>
“My coat—” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t need one. It’s balmy.”
</p>

<p>
“So are you.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks.” He guided her down the steps.
</p>

<p>
This was a switch for Laura. She had never been especially
attractive to men before, starting at the beginning
with her father and going right on up through
college. She didn’t look warm and soft and yielding.
She was remote and involved in herself, aloof from everybody,
men included. She didn’t like them very much
and they sensed it.
</p>

<p>
Now, here was a well educated intelligent male giving
her the rush. She didn’t understand it. Jack didn’t
appeal to her physically any more than any other man;
in fact, a little less. He was small, wiry, rather owlish
in his horn rims. He looked like an ivy league undergrad.
She guessed he was about twenty-five. Laura was
twenty. But she supposed that in five or six years
she might be as cynical as Jack was. She liked to hear
him say things she never dared to say herself.
</p>

<p>
They went to a little bar a few blocks away where Laura
had gone once with Marcie for a beer. It was a quiet
spot with a steady clientele.
</p>

<p>
They walked in and took a booth in the back. “I usually
prefer the bar,” said Jack, “but I always end up telling
my troubles to the bartender. So we’ll sit back here.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt a little strange walking into a bar in a
pair of pants, but she was with a man and she hoped
that made it all right.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="51" id="page-51"></a>
“Just a beer,” she said to Jack. A year ago she would
have said. “Just a coke.” And said it in a way to
make him think she disapproved of liquor. But lately
she had picked up a taste for beer. Beth liked it and
so did Marcie. That was too much for Laura. There
must be something to it. So she had gotten into the
habit of having one now and then in the evening when
she got home from work. It relaxed her. It made her feel
that she could think of Merrill Landon without exploding,
or of Marcie without crawling out of her skin.
She felt like maybe she could stand it, living this way
with Marcie, and everything would turn out all right.
</p>

<p>
The waitress brought their drinks, and Jack poured
her beer for her. Then he downed his shot and drank
some water. He seemed to be looking for a way to talk
to her. “How long have you and Marcie been together?”
he said finally.
</p>

<p>
<em>That’s an odd way to put it</em>, Laura thought warily.
“Since January,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yeah. I guess Burr mentioned it. He likes you.”
He smiled at her and she relaxed a little.
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t Burr and Marcie get along?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
Jack shrugged and hailed the waitress. Then he looked
at Laura. “They don’t want to,” he said. “It would spoil
the fun.”
</p>

<p>
“They love each other,” said Laura.
</p>

<p>
“Physically, yes, they do.”
</p>

<p>
Laura didn’t like his definition. “Marcie says they might
get married again.”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah. They’re just blind enough to do it, too.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie’s not blind!”
</p>

<p>
“Sorry. A slip of the tongue.” He grinned and drank
the fresh drink the waitress had just delivered.
</p>

<p>
“Well, she’s not,” Laura said, disconcerted by his
manner. “She really loves Burr—at least, she thinks she
does.”
</p>

<p>
He put his glass down. “Marcie hasn’t learned to
love yet,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“You mean she doesn’t love Burr?” She asked the question
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
“No,” he said quietly, studying her. “She loves physical
excitement. She loves a big virile passionate sonofabitch
to make a fuss over her.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="52" id="page-52"></a>
“You’re wrong,” she said, disappointed. “She doesn’t
fight just for the sake of fighting. It’s just with Burr.
She never fights with me.”
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed a little, privately. “That’s because
you’re a girl, Mother,” he said. “I can tell ’cause you
got long hair.”
</p>

<p>
Laura began to sweat under his searching eyes. “That’s
not the point,” she said, exasperated. “Marcie has a
sweet disposition. She’s very quiet. It must be Burr.”
</p>

<p>
“Quiet?” Jack laughed. “The way that girl talks she’s
about as quiet as Grand Central during rush hour.”
</p>

<p>
“All right, she talks a lot.” Laura was getting mad.
“That doesn’t mean she likes fights. Or men who thrive
on them.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s just what it does mean. Believe it. It’s true.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re screwy.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re in love.”
</p>

<p>
“What?” She said it in a shocked whisper, staring
at him, feeling her cheeks go scarlet. “What does
that mean?” she said. Her voice was dry and small and
her hands were wet.
</p>

<p>
Jack drank another shot. Then he put the glass down
and leaned toward her over the table, his face serious.
“You’re gay, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was speechless for a moment, surprised beyond
her capacity to think or feel. Then an awful sick trembling
came up in her throat. For a minute she hung
between flight and a fight. She was furious, scared and
humiliated. It never occurred to her to deny the truth.
Jack had hit the bull’s eye. She clenched her fists on the
table top and violent things came to her lips. But before
she could utter them Jack spoke again.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, don’t look so damn mad. You’re not the only
one.” He sighed, crushing his cigarette in a scorched
ashtray. “I am too. So don’t give me a martyr act.” And
he nodded again to the waitress.
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands over her face suddenly, pressing
one hand over her mouth to catch the sobs. She heard the
waitress come up and turned her head to the wall.
</p>

<p>
“Same for me,” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
“How about the lady?”
</p>

<p>
“Bring her a double whisky.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="53" id="page-53"></a>
Laura could feel the woman looking at her curiously.
She wanted to evaporate. She hated the impersonal curiosity
of this stranger. After a minute Jack said, “She’s
gone.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands down, but she couldn’t look at
him. She just said, rather hopelessly, “How did you
know?”
</p>

<p>
“Takes one to know one,” he said with light sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
“<em>How?</em>” Laura demanded. “You’re a man.”
</p>

<p>
“So I’m a man. You’re a girl. We’re both queer.”
</p>

<p>
“How did you know?” she said sharply, looking at
him now.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve got a crush on Marcie. That’s how.”
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped a little. “Is it so obvious?” she asked,
frightened.
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head. “To me, maybe, but only because
I was looking for it.”
</p>

<p>
“You were? Why?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m always looking for it.” He was bantering
again. She realized now that he had called her Laura
when he said it: <em>You’re gay, Laura</em>. He was dead serious
then.
</p>

<p>
“Do you look for it even in girls?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“In anybody. You might say it’s a hobby with me. I
spot one and I think to myself, ‘Another poor bastard
like me.’ It boosts my morale. I guess it’s a case of misery
loves company.”
</p>

<p>
“I’d rather suffer alone,” she said, not without pride.
</p>

<p>
“You’ll get over that. When you learn your way around.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was still trembling all over. “Listen to me,
Jack,” she said, leaning over the table and brushing
the last tear impatiently from her cheeks. “I never
heard that word—gay—like you use it until our date
Friday. Nobody ever called me ‘gay’ before. I didn’t
even know what it meant. But I’ll tell you this: I never
touched Marcie. I’ve never tried to get away with anything
with her. Never. She doesn’t know and she never
will.” She said this almost fiercely, but Jack only smiled
at her.
</p>

<p>
“Okay,” he said. “Don’t preach at me. I believe you.
I believe you haven’t been climbing into Marcie’s
bed after hours, anyway. But don’t let Marcie fool you.
<a class="pagenum" title="54" id="page-54"></a>
She can be wild sometimes. She gets in crazy moods and
she’ll do anything. I saw her go up to a bum in Central
Park and kiss him once on a dare. A big ugly slob of a guy.
It was enough to get her killed, but she loved it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was revolted. But not surprised. Not after what
Marcie had done to her last Friday night.
</p>

<p>
“She couldn’t possibly suspect me,” she said stubbornly.
“I never do a thing.”
</p>

<p>
“You did plenty in The Cellar Friday night.”
</p>

<p>
“I—I did?” She felt that old sick feeling come over
her again.
</p>

<p>
“You looked at her like you had ideas. You held
the door for her. You argued with Burr.”
</p>

<p>
“But all I said was—”
</p>

<p>
“All you said was you were gay. To anybody who
bothered to figure it out. Well, I did, that’s all.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s face was hot and she tried to defend herself.
“All I did was defend them—homosexuals, I mean. I
just said they were human beings, not animals. Is that
against the law?”
</p>

<p>
“Not ‘they,’ Mother,” Jack said softly. “‘We.’ You’re
one of us.”
</p>

<p>
“But Burr and Marcie don’t know that,” she said, almost
pleading with him to agree.
</p>

<p>
Jack raised a finger to his lips. “Everybody will know it
if you don’t keep your voice down,” he said. “Okay, Burr
doesn’t know it. As for Marcie, you live with the girl.
You should know.”
</p>

<p>
“She couldn’t,” Laura said, but she felt shaky.
</p>

<p>
“You aren’t sure, are you? Why don’t you find out?”
</p>

<p>
“How?” She looked at him eagerly.
</p>

<p>
“Ask her.” He laughed to see her face fall.
</p>

<p>
“Damn you!”
</p>

<p>
“Okay. Don’t ask her. Make a pass at her.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re mad!” Laura stared at him, shocked. “I’d
never do such a thing! She might—why, my God, she
might call the police. Or Burr. She’d hate me. I couldn’t
stand it. Jack, don’t tell me to make a fool of myself. Do
you want to get me into a tragic mess?”
</p>

<p>
“I want to keep you <em>out</em> of one, Mother. That’s why
I’m talking this way.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, act like you did, then. You drag me down
<a class="pagenum" title="55" id="page-55"></a>
here, when I didn’t want to come in the first place,
and tell me—” She swallowed convulsively. “—tell me
I’m <em>gay</em>.” She spat the word at him. “And then you have
the gall to sit there and tell me to make love to Marcie—”
She almost choked on the words. “—when you know
damn well she’d probably be revolted by it, she’d—”
</p>

<p>
“Calm down, Mother, have a drink.” And he held
her glass up to her until she took it from him. It
burned her throat but she was too worked up to care.
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said Jack. “I asked you down here to tell you
I know you’re gay. And so am I. I want to be friends
with you, Laura.” She glanced up at him, and found
that he was embarrassed, for all the liquid courage he
was consuming, and it was hard for him to talk.
“Damn it,” he said. “I’m so used to talking like an
idiot, I can’t say what I mean anymore. I—I wanted
to tell you—to warn you, Laura—I was in the situation
you’re in now. Once. Long ago. I fell for a roommate
of mine, I didn’t think he knew anything either. I
didn’t see how it was possible. I was so damn careful.
I never said anything, I never <em>did</em> anything. Jesus
Christ, I even avoided the guy. I went out of my way to
avoid him. But I was nuts about him, Laura. I wanted
him so bad it hurt. I’d lie there in the dark and tell
myself, ‘You can’t have him, you can’t have him’ over
and over. I’d say, ‘Who the hell do you think you are?
If you were the prettiest boy on earth he wouldn’t look
twice. And, Mann, you aren’t the prettiest boy on earth.
You’re the ugliest.’ Whenever we talked late at night,
whenever we went anywhere together, whenever we
touched I used to burn up inside, I used to die of it. I
wanted to kiss him, feel him all over, just hold him.
God, it killed me! But I never let on. Never. And one
day—this’ll give you an idea of what to expect,
Mother—one day after all this noble chastity and virtue
and self-denial crap I was going through, he came
up to me and said, ‘Jack, I hate to say this, but I’m
moving out.’”
</p>

<p>
“Why?” Laura asked softly, her forehead wrinkled
with sympathy.
</p>

<p>
“Because I was gay. He didn’t say it that way, of
course. He didn’t say, ‘Because you’re queer, you poor
<a class="pagenum" title="56" id="page-56"></a>
bastard. I’m sorry for you but I can’t take it any more.’ I
could have stood that. But he just handed me a lot of
bull.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt like crying again. But she only said,
“Isn’t that something to be grateful for? He tried, anyway.”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah. He tried.” He said it so acidly that Laura
was afraid to say any more.
</p>

<p>
“There’ve been a lot since Joe,” he said, after a
while. “Just like there’ll be a lot for you after Marcie.”
Laura tried to protest but he waved her down. “I know,
I know, you’re going to keep hands off. You’re going to
spend your whole life ignoring sex, ignoring what you are.
Denying that you want it, running away from it. I
was going to, too. That was twenty-five years ago.”
</p>

<p>
“Twenty-five years ago!” Laura stared at him. “How
old are you, Jack?”
</p>

<p>
“Forty-two. Surprised?” He smiled at her gaping
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
“I thought you were maybe five years older than I
am. Twenty-five or so. You <em>can’t</em> be forty-two.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what I keep telling myself. I can’t be. But I
sure as hell am.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t believe it.”
</p>

<p>
He grinned. “Good,” he said. “I like to fool people.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?” It seemed crazy. “What does a man care how
young he looks? I thought that was for women,” Laura
said.
</p>

<p>
“Women and gay boys. Do you think some pretty
twenty-year-old is going to fall for a fat bald, middle-aged
bastard with not even a bankroll to offer? I’m
ugly, Mother. That’s enough of a handicap. When I
start looking old, I’ll quit.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re not ugly, Jack,” she said gently, trying to
console him.
</p>

<p>
But he took it with a sardonic laugh. “Only a
Mother could love me,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t talk like this. You make me so sad.”
</p>

<p>
“Ahhh, Christ,” he said, and drank. He looked up at
Laura, and she could see he wasn’t focusing very well
now. “I came here to talk about you anyway, not me.
What did your father do to you when you were five
years old?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="57" id="page-57"></a>
Laura started. “When did I say that? Did I mention
my father?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. In The Cellar. Probably as good a place as any.”
</p>

<p>
“I—I didn’t mean <em>my</em> father,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t fib to me, Laura. Let’s be friends.”
</p>

<p>
After a few moments, she said, “I can’t talk about it,
Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“What did he do?”
</p>

<p>
“We—we were at a summer resort.” It began to spill
out of her. Jack had bared his anguish, and she felt
suddenly safe with him, and needed. “We were there
for a vacation one summer. We went fishing on the
lake—Father and Mother and my brother and me.” Her
voice grew soft as she spoke. “The boat capsized. I was
the only one he could save. I was the closest to him.
Mother and Rod drowned.” She shut her eyes with a little
gasp against the old horror, still so sharp in her
heart, like a big ugly needle stuck there to remind her
she had no right to be alive. “All my life I’ve felt as
if I killed them. He says I did. He hates me because
I’m not his son. He hates me because I’m not my own
mother, his wife.” Jack seemed completely sober for a
minute, staring at her with his brows knit. She put
her head down and cried quietly. “That’s all,” she said.
“I can’t tell you any more.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t need to,” he said softly. “Jesus.”
</p>

<p>
She took a deep breath and sat up, feeling as if she
had lightened the weight of that leaden secret by sharing
it. She was somewhat surprised to find that she
was able to share it. She felt very close to Jack, as if
they were now truly friends. Each of them had risked a
little of himself to the other. And neither, now, was
sorry.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh, she looked at her watch. It was getting
late. “I have to get up early,” she said, her voice still
unsteady. “So do you. I know, Burr’s always yelling about
the hours. Let’s go.”
</p>

<p>
“One more,” he said, holding up his glass. “I’m
not quite through with you yet.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t get it,” Laura said to him. “We don’t even
know each other. This is the second time we’ve seen
each other. And here we are talking like old friends.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re wrong, Laura. We know each other a lot better
<a class="pagenum" title="58" id="page-58"></a>
than some people who’ve been acquainted for years.
Like Burr and Marcie. We know each other instinctively,
don’t you feel that? I wouldn’t have called you
otherwise. You wouldn’t have let me drag you out tonight
otherwise.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t talk about Marcie as if she didn’t have a
brain in her head,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
Jack smiled. “You <em>are</em> in love,” he said. “This is
serious. She has a few brains, Mother, she just doesn’t
use them.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s not stupid,” Laura defended her eagerly.
</p>

<p>
“She’s not sacred either.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t mean that.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes you did. I thought Burr was once.”
</p>

<p>
“Burr?” Laura stared at him. “Did you—were you—”
</p>

<p>
“Nuts for Burr? Yes. Once. When I first met him.”
</p>

<p>
“What happened?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing. Thank God. I got over it. I go for big
virile sons of bitches, just like Marcie. But I take care not
to room with them anymore.”
</p>

<p>
Laura shook her head, a wry little smile on her face.
“Don’t you ever fall for the gay ones?”
</p>

<p>
“I try to make a point of it.” He grinned sadly. “Unfortunately
I sometimes miss the point. If you know what
I mean.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not sure.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s just as well. I met Burr at work when he was hired
about four years ago. I knew he was straight.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s ‘straight’?”
</p>

<p>
“Everything that’s not ‘gay’—so I pussyfooted around
the issue. I made him like me. I did his homework for
him. I made him laugh. I told him what to tell the boss.
I double-dated with him and Marcie and I was an usher
at the wedding. I was Number One trouble-shooter <em>after</em>
the wedding. He thinks I’m indispensable.”
</p>

<p>
“But you—you don’t still—”
</p>

<p>
“No, I don’t. Not anymore. But I still like to be with
him. I like to watch them fight.” He smiled at her. “You
do too.”
</p>

<p>
She felt embarrassed, as if he were looking through her
clothes to her naked feelings.
</p>

<p>
“However,” he went on, “I’m not under any lovely illusions
<a class="pagenum" title="59" id="page-59"></a>
about him being an intellectual giant. Or Marcie
either. And I know damn well he won’t give me a tumble
if I just stick around long enough.” He gave her a
piercing look. “Those are your illusions, Mother,” he said.
“I suggest you drown them.”
</p>

<p>
“What does that mean?”
</p>

<p>
“You can set Marcie’s hair till the moon turns blue and
she’s not going to crawl into your bed to thank you for
it.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t expect her to.”
</p>

<p>
“Sure you do. It’s a mark of our breed. We’re hopeless
optimists. Otherwise we’d all commit suicide. We get
a crush on somebody, and if he’s straight we figure we’ll
just love him so much he’ll <em>have</em> to turn gay. It doesn’t
work that way. Marcie isn’t going to start kissing you
just because you want her to.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was incensed. “She already has,” she snapped.
</p>

<p>
Jack’s eyebrows went up. “When?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“The night we got back from The Cellar. She said she
felt funny in there with all those girls staring at her. She
said she used to touch tongues with a girl when she was
in her teens, and she wanted to do it again. And she did.
You—you—” She didn’t know what to call him. “You
had to call me up right in the middle, just when I
thought—” She stopped herself. “Oh, this isn’t like me,”
she moaned. “I never talk like this.”
</p>

<p>
“Only to yourself, hm?” He laughed. “I mess up your
daydreams and your affair. God! What more can I do?
I’m becoming the Man in your Life, Mother.” His laughter
fizzled slowly, and Laura could tell he was quite drunk
from the way he let his head hang for a minute. “You
know,” he said and wagged a finger at her, articulating
cautiously, “I never have trouble thinking when I’m drunk.
But my tongue gets sloppy.” He laughed a little. “I say
what I want to say, that’s one good thing. But it sounds
sloppy as hell.” He finished the drink in front of him.
Laura started to get up, but he caught her wrist and
said, suddenly very serious again, “You’re in trouble,
Laura. Marcie’s straight. Accept that. It’s a fact. If she’s
playing games with you, she’s doing it for private kicks,
not to give you a thrill. And her kicks have nothing to do
with being gay. They have to do with going out on a
<a class="pagenum" title="60" id="page-60"></a>
limb, with acting nuts once in a while. Maybe she’s just
pushing <em>you</em> out on a limb to see if you’ll fall off. And
you’ll fall all right. Flat on your can.” He stopped for a
minute to focus his gaze on her. “Marcie’s about as
queer as Post Toasties, Laura. Take my advice: move
out.”
</p>

<p>
“But I can’t! I won’t!” she exclaimed defensively. “Why
should I? I’ve done nothing wrong!”
</p>

<p>
“I hadn’t either when Joe gave me the glad news.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not you. I’ve done nothing I’m ashamed of.”
</p>

<p>
“No, but you will. If you hang around, feeling like you
feel. You were saved by a phone call Friday night. What
if my timing isn’t so good next time?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to move out.” She said it stubbornly like
a thwarted child.
</p>

<p>
“All the more reason why you should.”
</p>

<p>
Laura got indignant. “I’ve got more will power than
you give me credit for and I’m not going to be scared
out.”
</p>

<p>
“What are you going to do for will power if she gets
cold some night and crawls into your bed to keep warm?
Or you take a shower together? Or she feels like pulling
your nerves out by the roots one by one again, and makes
you play let’s-touch-tongues just for the hell of it? Just to
see if she can get you sent up for sodomy? Be thankful
you’re female, Mother. At least your passion won’t stand
up and salute her.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve had enough from you tonight!”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, okay. But I advise you to find a nice butch
somewhere and set up housekeeping in the Village. Or
at least, cultivate a few lovelies down there so you’ll have
a place to let off steam when Marcie feels like playing
games.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re drunk and repulsive.”
</p>

<p>
“I know what I am, Laura. Don’t change the subject.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m going home.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m coming with you.” He got up unsteadily and followed
her toward the door. Outside he stopped her.
“Don’t hate me, Laura,” he said. And she couldn’t, looking
at him there in the pink glare of neon, short and
plain, brilliant and miserable, offering her his curious
stinging sympathy.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="61" id="page-61"></a>
“I wish I could,” she said and shook her head.
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her. “I’ll walk you home,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t need to. Why don’t you get a taxi and get
yourself home?”
</p>

<p>
“Are you suggesting I can’t walk?”
</p>

<p>
“No.” She laughed.
</p>

<p>
“You are. Just for that I’m going to walk you home
whether you like it or not. To prove I can.”
</p>

<p>
“All right.” But she had to lead him most of the way.
Jack could talk better than he could navigate when he was
high. When they reached the apartment she hailed a cab
for him and put him in it. She stood there watching it
pull away down West End Avenue, watching it till it was
indistinguishable from the sea of red tail lights traveling
with it. And she felt an awakening affection for him.

Chapter Seven
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was hard to get up the next day. Not impossible, just
hard. Discouraging. Her head ached, and she was dissatisfied
with herself. For the first time she wanted to
cut work. But she went and she did her job. It wasn’t
until the middle of the afternoon that she jumped to hear
Sarah ask, “What’s the matter, Laura? A little under the
weather?”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up at her. <em>Do I look that bad?</em> she wondered.
“I’m a little tired. Why?”
</p>

<p>
“The reports are piling up,” Sarah said, nodding at
them.
</p>

<p>
Laura rubbed her forehead. “I’m sorry, Sarah. I’ll
catch up. I’ll work late.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be silly!” Sarah laughed good-naturedly. “Catch
up tomorrow. There’s not that much of a rush.”
</p>

<p>
But the next day she didn’t quite catch up; she got
farther behind, in fact. Burr and Marcie had kept her
up. It was partly the quarrel and partly the torturing silence
that followed it. She went to work still more tired
than the day before. Dr. Carstens came in to tell her a
story about one of his woman patients, and she was
frankly irritated. He picked himself up from her desk,
where he was sitting, and huffed out, offended. “Okay,
don’t laugh,” he said. “The others thought it was funny.”
</p>

<p>
Laura drove herself almost crazy with her errors that
afternoon. When her phone rang she jumped half out of
her chair. It was Jack.
</p>

<p>
“Good afternoon, Mother,” he said. “I’m selling used
tooth brushes. Interested?”
</p>

<p>
“No. I’m very busy. Goodby.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll see you at eight.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Eight-fifteen.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="63" id="page-63"></a>
“Eight-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
“All right! All right! All right! Goodby!” She slammed
the receiver down and Sarah stared at her.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura decided to work late, and it was close to eight-thirty
when she got up to go. The reports, though fewer,
were still not done.
</p>

<p>
At the elevator the boy said, “Nice evening.”
</p>

<p>
“Is it?” She answered him apathetically, involved in
her own world.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, ma’am. It’s really spring tonight.” He smiled at
her.
</p>

<p>
He was right. The air was soft and gentle, lavender and
clear. It even smelled good, right there in mid-Manhattan,
although that was probably an hallucination.
Laura smiled a little. She hated to go underground to the
subway, but it was late, and she wanted to get home in a
hurry. It would really be gorgeous out on the roof tonight.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She walked in to find Jack and Burr playing checkers.
Marcie was cross-legged on the floor, in velvet lounging
pants and a silk shirt, humming while she covered the top
of the round cocktail table with a plastic veneer
treated to look like marble.
</p>

<p>
She smiled up at Laura, who paused to admire her.
“Alcohol proof,” Marcie said, rattling the table cover.
“Mr. Marquardt gave it to me. We’re advertising it for a
new client, and they passed some around today. It sticks
by itself. How do you like it?”
</p>

<p>
“It looks wonderful,” Laura said. So did Marcie, her
cheeks pink with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve had it, Mann,” Burr said, and Laura heard a
checker smacking triumphantly over the board in a devastating
series of jumps. “Touché, boy.”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you take up tiddly winks? I could beat you
at tiddly winks.” Jack sat with his elbows on his knees
and his chin in his hand. He looked up at Laura without
raising his head and smiled. She looked at him, absorbed
in the idea that he had once been infatuated with the
man beside him, and Burr had never known it. Burr
thought he was as normal as himself. But of course,
<a class="pagenum" title="64" id="page-64"></a>
they had never roomed together. Suddenly Laura recalled
that she had agreed to go out with Jack.
</p>

<p>
“Jack—” she began, but he cut her off.
</p>

<p>
“I see I have less allure than your typewriter,” he said.
He cocked an eye at her. “Well, never mind, I don’t have
so many friends I can afford to be jealous of their typewriters.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Jack,” she said with a little smile. She turned
to go into the kitchen, but he jumped up and followed
her.
</p>

<p>
“Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
</p>

<p>
“Straight to the icebox. I’m starved.”
</p>

<p>
“We have a date. I’m taking you out to dinner.”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t we just stay here?” she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
But all he said was, “No,” and she understood that he
had made his mind up and had something planned.
</p>

<p>
She was reluctant to leave Marcie, who looked so pretty.
But the prettier Marcie looked, the worse Laura suffered.
Maybe it would be better just to talk about her tonight.
Talk to Jack about her. It sounded good.
</p>

<p>
“Okay, but let’s get home early. I’m beat, I really am,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“Whatever you say, Mother.” He smiled, and she felt
suddenly that it was terribly good to have him for a friend.
</p>

<p>
When they got outside she said, “Let’s go over to Hempel’s.
It’s only a block.”
</p>

<p>
“No. We’re going to The Cellar.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, God no! It’s miles away. We wouldn’t get home
till midnight.”
</p>

<p>
“A friend of mine wants to meet you.”
</p>

<p>
“Who?”
</p>

<p>
“The name wouldn’t mean anything. It would just
scare you away, probably. She saw you when we were
there last week. She likes your face.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, that’s ridiculous. Come on, I’m starving. I’ve got
to eat or I’ll faint.”
</p>

<p>
“This is a very interesting girl. She could teach you
a lot.”
</p>

<p>
“I know everything I want to know.” He laughed, but
she went on, “Jack, I’m not going to the Village with you.”
</p>

<p>
But when they reached Broadway he hailed a cab and
she let him put her in it, as she knew she would. “I can’t.
<a class="pagenum" title="65" id="page-65"></a>
I won’t. I’m tired and hungry,” she said. But she got in.
“I’ll fall asleep over my typewriter tomorrow,” she
moaned.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the Cellar she felt a lift of excitement
in spite of herself. They arrived after the kitchen
had closed, but Jack was a regular customer, and they
were willing to fix him up.
</p>

<p>
They followed a waitress to a table. Laura walked with a
strange light queasiness in her stomach and sat down with
Jack feeling terribly self-conscious and looked-at, as if
every pair of eyes in the room was inspecting her. Jack
laughed, waving at somebody. “All my friends’ll think I’ve
gone straight,” he said. He gave the waitress an order
and she scuttled off. He leaned back in his chair to look
at Laura then. “Sorry you’re here?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“No. But I wish it was Friday night.”
</p>

<p>
“Relax. We’ll leave when you say the word.”
</p>

<p>
She began to feel adventurous and crazy. Jack went up
to get them both a drink. She eyed it with suspicion, but
then she picked it up and drank half of it down, and it
hit her like a bomb, a big soft lovely explosion of warmth
in the pit of her stomach. She blinked at Jack, who only
smiled, knowing the feeling.
</p>

<p>
“How would you like to be in here some night,” he said
slowly, “with Marcie beside you? And sit alone together
at that little table over there? And tell her you love her?”
Laura took another gulp of the drink and almost finished
it. “And hear her say the same thing?”
</p>

<p>
Laura put the glass down with trembling hands. “Oh,
Jack, you bastard,” she said, her insides aflame. “Cut it
out.”
</p>

<p>
“You want it so badly,” he said, “that it’s tearing your
guts out. And it’s never going to happen. So open your
eyes. Look around. There are some beautiful women here
tonight. There’s one as pretty as Marcie.” He squinted
over her shoulder. Laura turned around indignantly to
look, and saw a charming face framed in short brown
curls smiling at a table partner. She looked up at the sudden
sight of Laura’s own face, pale and compelling.
</p>

<p>
“Nobody’s as pretty as Marcie,” Laura told him.
</p>

<p>
“Somebody was,” Jack said, with his peculiar intuition
taking him straight to the point.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="66" id="page-66"></a>
“What do you mean?” Laura said defensively, and finished
her drink.
</p>

<p>
“Whenever you know damn well what I mean,” he said
with a smile, “you ask ‘what do I mean.’ As if I were
nuts. Well, I’m not. Give me your glass.” He took it and
got up. “Never thought you’d beat me to the bottom,
Mother.” He peered into it with one eye and then left to
get it refilled.
</p>

<p>
Laura leaned back in her seat and shut her eyes. After
all, what did it matter if she were here? She felt wonderful.
She had put in a terrific day’s work, she had a right
to a little fling. Her body glowed through its whole length.
Marcie loomed in her mind like a lovely apparition, not
quite real.
</p>

<p>
<em>I’ll have her someday</em>, Laura thought. <em>No matter what
he says.</em>
</p>

<p>
She looked around her, half consciously searching for
someone. But the girl in the black pants wasn’t there. The
crowd was much the same as before, but thinner. The
artist was walking around with his sketch pad, stopping
to talk to tablesful of friends. The bar was crowded, more
than the tables.
</p>

<p>
Jack came back, put a fresh glass in front of her, and
sat down. “Now. What was her name?” he said.
</p>

<p>
Laura opened her eyes slowly. “Who?”
</p>

<p>
“Number one.”
</p>

<p>
She wrinkled her nose in some disgust. “Jack, she wasn’t
a number. Or an animal. Or part of a collection.”
</p>

<p>
“What was she?”
</p>

<p>
“She was a wonderful girl.”
</p>

<p>
“Beautiful like Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“No. Beautiful—but not like Marcie. They have some
features in common. But Beth was taller. She was quite
boyish.” She felt a little embarrassed suddenly, putting it
this way. “Marcie’s very feminine.”
</p>

<p>
“What are you?”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him over the rim of her glass. “What
am I?” she repeated, confusedly. “Do I have to be anything?
I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“You’ll find out fast enough,” he said. “Beth probably
taught you a lot. The one who brings you out always
does.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="67" id="page-67"></a>
“Yes, she did,” she said dreamily. Beth had loosened
her up wonderfully when they were together. She had taken
her by the hand and led her to herself. She had also abandoned
her there. But Laura couldn’t hold anything
against her. That had been a sacred love and always
would be in her memory, like all loves that are broken off
in full passion. If they had been together till it had worn
off a little, Laura might have left her without any desperate
regrets and loneliness. She might have been able to
see Beth as a whole person, not as an ideal. But it hadn’t
happened that way, and Beth still looked like a goddess
to her.
</p>

<p>
Now, in a new world, with new people, she wasn’t sure
what she was. With Marcie she felt aggressive and violent.
Here, in the Cellar, with so many eyes on her, she felt
timid.
</p>

<p>
Jack grinned at her. “You’re a boy,” he said. “With
Marcie, anyway. My friend won’t like that.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her glass down. “I’m a girl,” she said. “Don’t
look at me that way.”
</p>

<p>
Jack put his head back and laughed. “Correction,” he
said. “You’re a girl. Why don’t you move down here
where you don’t have to be either?”
</p>

<p>
“Everybody has to be one or the other.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re too literal, Laura. Cut off your hair. Wear
those pants you look so nice in. Get some desert boots, a
car coat and some men’s shirts, and you’re in business.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack,” she said, “You are positively revolting.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s the uniform,” he said. “Can’t join the club
without it.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to join.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes you do. You feel good in pants. You swagger.”
</p>

<p>
“I do not!” But she was laughing at him. At herself.
</p>

<p>
“Shhh!” he said softly. “Or they’ll cut you off. Here
comes dinner.”
</p>

<p>
The presence of the waitress made it impossible to talk.
She set a delectable dinner in front of Laura. But somehow,
after the first few bites, it lost its appeal. She sat
gazing at the plate, wondering where her enormous appetite
had gone, pushing a mushroom dreamily from one
side to the other. Jack smiled, watching her. He leaned
over the table on his elbows and picked up her knife.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="68" id="page-68"></a>
“Laura,” he said, pointing at her mushroom. Then he
pushed another one slowly across the plate from the other
side. “Marcie,” he said, nodding at it. The two mushrooms
made contact south of the fried potatoes, and Laura felt
crazy, watching it. It made her smile; she thought it was
ridiculous. It made her want to laugh, and it brought a
warm, unwanted, urgent feeling up in her legs at the same
time. She pushed “Laura” behind the steak.
</p>

<p>
“Ah,” said Jack. “Laura’s afraid of Marcie. But Marcie’s
not afraid of anything. Marcie’s a little heller. Here she
comes.” And he pushed his mushroom after hers. Laura
felt her cheeks get hot.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not going to run away,” she said, and took a large
swallow from her drink, letting “Laura” stay put.
</p>

<p>
“Okay, be a hero,” said Jack. “Make it easy for her.
Look at that little bitch!” and he scooped “Marcie” over
“Laura,” back and forth, the passage facilitated by the
gravy. “She’s nuts. She’s on a kick. She wants you to make
a fool of yourself.”
</p>

<p>
Laura wouldn’t watch. She finished her drink for an
excuse not to look.
</p>

<p>
“But look at Laura,” Jack went on. “She can’t stand it.
Where Marcie goes, Laura goes.” And he pushed “Marcie”
and “Laura” around the plate together.
</p>

<p>
“Stop it, Jack. Get me another drink.”
</p>

<p>
“Here’s where Laura goes crazy.”
</p>

<p>
“Now stop it!”
</p>

<p>
He crammed the two mushrooms into the potatoes, helter
skelter, one over the other. “Laura got what she
wanted,” he said, after a minute, looking up at her
briefly. “But see what happens to her.” And with one
sudden cruel stroke he sliced “Laura” in half. Laura gave
a little start. “‘Marcie’ got bored with the game,” he explained.
</p>

<p>
Laura laughed nervously. “Now cut it out and get me a
drink,” she said.
</p>

<p>
He got up smiling, without a word, and went to the
bar. Laura couldn’t look at the plate. She signaled the
waitress, who came over with a water pitcher.
</p>

<p>
“Will you take this out please?”
</p>

<p>
“Something wrong with it?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t eat mushrooms.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="69" id="page-69"></a>
“Well, why dincha say so!” She took the plate with an
angry “Jeez!” muttered under her breath.
</p>

<p>
Jack came back to find her laughing. “Couldn’t take
it, hm?” He nodded at the vacant space where the plate
was, and then looked at Laura. “Want to leave?”
</p>

<p>
“No. I don’t want to go anywhere, Jack. Let’s just sit
here a while and talk.”
</p>

<p>
“About Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“About Marcie.” She laughed again.
</p>

<p>
“By Jesus, you’re a pretty girl,” he said quietly. “I
didn’t realize it till now. You ought to get soused more
often.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not soused, I’m in love.”
</p>

<p>
He gave a snort of disbelief. “Okay not-soused and in-love.
You’re headed straight blind for misery. You know
that.”
</p>

<p>
“My eyes are wide open. She’ll never love me.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t tell me. Tell yourself. Believe yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“I do.”
</p>

<p>
He shook his head and laughed a little. “I see it coming
and I tell you ‘Look out, she’s murder’ and you say ‘You’re
absolutely right’ and then off you go to slit your own
throat.” He leaned over the table seriously. “Leave her,
Laura,” he pleaded, and took her by surprise with his
earnestness. “It’s no good falling for a straight one.
Believe me.”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t leave her,” she said stubbornly. “I know what
I’m doing.”
</p>

<p>
He leaned back with a sigh. “Then at least look at
somebody else,” he said. “Look at Beebo. She’s cruising
you like mad.”
</p>

<p>
“Who’s Beebo? I wouldn’t look at anybody with such a
ridiculous name. What’s cruising?”
</p>

<p>
“Beebo’s a friend of mine. And cruising—well—you’ll
catch on.” He grinned.
</p>

<p>
Laura turned warily around. At the bar sat the handsome
boyish girl she had admired the week before. She
was gazing boldly, but without great interest, at Laura.
When Laura turned to see her she smiled, very slightly.
</p>

<p>
Laura turned back to Jack. “Is that Beebo?” she asked.
“In the black pants?”
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed at her. “You mean tan shorts?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="70" id="page-70"></a>
Laura looked again. “Well, she had on black pants last
time.”
</p>

<p>
“Did she?” He grinned. “She says you had on a blue
dress with a white collar. You did, too. I remember it.
She liked it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him and then got indignant. “What’s she
doing, remembering my clothes like that? That’s silly.”
</p>

<p>
“So are you. You noticed hers.”
</p>

<p>
“I just—oh, damn! She followed us into the john.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. She talked to me before she went after you.
I told you, Mother. She likes your face.”
</p>

<p>
“She likes Marcie’s. That’s why she followed us,” she
snapped.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head “no.”
</p>

<p>
“How do you know?” Laura flared, the jealousy working
in her.
</p>

<p>
“I know Beebo,” he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
Laura was getting curious. She finished her drink in
three big swallows, which made Jack laugh. “Is she a friend
of yours?” she said.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. “More or less. I keep running into her at
parties. For years we ran into each other before we finally
got acquainted. I like her. She’s a hellion, but I like her.
She’s a cynic like me.”
</p>

<p>
“What a pity.” Laura feigned unconcern, running a
wet finger around the edge of her glass. “She looks like
Beth,” she said. “A little.”
</p>

<p>
Jack blew smoke through his nostrils from a freshly
lighted cigarette. “That means you like her,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Laura refused to honor such nonsense with an answer.
She was rather drunk now. She turned again to look at
Beebo. Beebo was still gazing at her, and she winked,
with that faint private smile still on her face. Laura
turned quickly back to Jack. “Is she coming over?” she
said, feeling slightly elated.
</p>

<p>
Jack was grinning past her at Beebo and nodding. At
her words he glanced at her. “No,” he said. “She’s an
uppity bitch.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was disappointed.
</p>

<p>
“Another drink?”
</p>

<p>
“One more. That’s all. What time is it?”
</p>

<p>
“Eleven-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="71" id="page-71"></a>
“No!” She tried to collect her thoughts, to right her
time sense, while Jack fetched the drinks. When he came
back she said, “How many drinks have I had?”
</p>

<p>
“Jesus, Mother, what a thing to ask a man. I can’t
even keep track of my own.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m lost,” she said. “I’ve lost count.”
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
“Shall we take off, Mother mine?” Jack said, very
carefully.
</p>

<p>
Laura tried to clear her head by shaking it and pressing
her eyes shut. “I guess we’d better,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I guess we <em>have</em> to. It’s four o’clock. They’re closing.”
</p>

<p>
“Four!” Laura came half awake at this.
</p>

<p>
“Four o’clock,” he repeated elaborately.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, God. Oh, my head.”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind, Mother, you can stay with me tonight.
I’ll try to keep my hands off you.” He laughed to himself.
</p>

<p>
Laura saw Jack looking up at somebody with a grin
and heard him say, “Hi, doll. I want you to meet my
mother. Mother, look alive.” He squinted at her doubtfully.
“If possible,” he added.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up and saw a startlingly handsome face
gazing down at her: black hair, pure blue eyes, a slight
smile that widened a little when Laura turned her face up.
</p>

<p>
“Hello,” Beebo said. “Laura.” Her smile gave emphasis
to the way she said Laura’s name.
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands to her head dizzily. “You look
just like Beth,” she murmured.
</p>

<p>
At which Beebo grinned, turning to Jack. “Three aspirins
and some warm tomato juice,” she said. “First thing when
she gets up. She’ll live.”
</p>

<p>
Laura watched her, fascinated, half smiling.
</p>

<p>
Beebo turned back to her and returned the smile. Then
she reached into her pocket and pulled out a dime. She
flipped it in the air and then dropped it insolently in front
of Laura. “Here’s a dime, sweetheart,” she said. “Call
me sometime.” And with a little grin at Jack, she turned
and left them.
</p>

<p>
Laura stuck her chin out indignantly. She was not too
drunk to be insulted. “Well, thanks a bunch, your majesty!”
she said sarcastically to Beebo’s back. She could
<a class="pagenum" title="72" id="page-72"></a>
hear Beebo laughing but she wouldn’t turn around. She
was already headed for the door.
</p>

<p>
Laura let Jack drag her to his apartment, three blocks
away. He took her up a few stone steps into a long dim
hall, and opened the first door on the left. He steered
her to his bed and pushed her till she collapsed backwards
on it. She fell asleep at once. Jack pulled her shoes
off and her skirt, with total unconcern for her femininity,
and got her under the covers.
</p>

<p>
Laura slept like a stone, a deep almost motionless sleep
that could have lasted far into the next day. But Jack
got her up at seven-thirty. She had three and a half hours
sleep, on virtually no dinner and eight or ten stiff drinks.
She felt strange new pains all over. Jack was used to such
excesses, though he tried to ration himself to one or two a
week. He took it pretty well in stride, but Laura felt
awful. Her first words when Jack shook her were, “Oh,
God! What time is it?”
</p>

<p>
“Seven-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
She turned over on her stomach and put her head
down on the pillow. “Where’s Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“At home. Where else?”
</p>

<p>
“What time is it? Oh, I asked you that. My head
hurts.”
</p>

<p>
“Take these, Mother,” he said, handing her some aspirin
and a glass of water.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t think I can swallow.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s a chance you’ll have to take. Here we go.” He
popped the pills into her mouth and gave her the water.
She gulped them convulsively. “That’ll see you through
till—” He looked at his watch. “—about noon. After that,
take three more and a No-Doz tablet. And hit the sack
tonight about six. It’s Friday. You can sleep for two days.”
</p>

<p>
“I will, too.” She rolled gingerly to a sitting position,
and looked at Jack with aching eyes. “You did this to
me,” she said mournfully.
</p>

<p>
“Be fair, Mother. I said I’d go whenever you wanted to.
I kept asking and you kept saying no.”
</p>

<p>
She stared at him, disbelieving. “Jack, you louse. You
should have dragged me out, you knew I—what’s that?”
There was a dime on the bed table.
</p>

<p>
Jack grinned at her. “Beebo’s calling card,” he said.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="73" id="page-73"></a>
Laura remembered it in a flash, although the rest of the
evening was little more than a blur. She picked it up and
threw it angrily across the room. “Give it back to her for
me,” she said. “All I remember about last night is that
awful girl and those awful mushrooms! God!”
</p>

<p>
Jack went out of the room laughing.
</p>

Chapter Eight
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> first thing Laura did when she got to work was to
call Marcie.
</p>

<p>
“Where were you?” Marcie demanded. “I was just going
to call you. I was worried sick.”
</p>

<p>
“You were?” She felt a momentary relief from her headache.
</p>

<p>
“Are you all right?”
</p>

<p>
“I think so. It got so late. We were talking. I finally
spent the night—” It suddenly occurred to her, as if a
brick had dropped on her tender head, that she had spent
the night in a man’s apartment. For the first time in her
life. Never mind that it was an innocent stay, or a short
one. Or that the man had no designs on her. It was the
idea of the thing.
</p>

<p>
“I spent the night with Jack,” she blurted. Marcie was
silent, having suspected as much, but not sure what to
say. And it was then Laura realized that she had said the
best possible thing. Even if it hadn’t happened it would
have been the best thing to say. Marcie didn’t know either
of them was gay. She only knew they were man and girl
and they had spent a night together. What could sound
more normal, more straight? Immoral, maybe, slightly immoral.
But straight.
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed finally.
</p>

<p>
“Is it funny?” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry,” Marcie said through her giggles. “I never
dreamed you and Jack would hit it off like this. He must
really like you, Laur.” She sobered suddenly. “He never
took much to the other girls we fixed him up with.”
</p>

<p>
Laura squirmed a little.
</p>

<p>
“But he talked you up for half an hour before you got
home last night. He thinks you’re very pretty.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt grateful to him. He must have done it to
enhance her in Marcie’s eyes, even if he did disapprove of
her infatuation.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="75" id="page-75"></a>
“Did he say that?” she said, pleased.
</p>

<p>
“He did. And he’s right.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was taken aback. Then she said quickly, “You’re
both crazy.”
</p>

<p>
“No, you are. We’re right. You never looked at yourself,
you silly girl. You don’t <em>know</em> what you look like.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you?” It sounded stupid, but it came out in spite
of her.
</p>

<p>
“Sure. I’ve looked at you when you weren’t noticing.”
</p>

<p>
<em>When could that have been?</em>
</p>

<p>
“I think you have a fascinating face.”
</p>

<p>
“But not pretty.”
</p>

<p>
“Lovely.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, listen to me, I—” She was shaky, mixed up
from the hangover and the unexpected flattery. She should
have said something terrible, something intimate, if Dr.
Hollingsworth hadn’t come in early. He nodded at her as
he walked through the office. Sarah was still in the wash
room putting on her face.
</p>

<p>
“’Morning, my dear,” said the doctor with a sort of
modified bow as he sailed past.
</p>

<p>
She returned the greeting and Marcie said, “I’ll get you
in dutch. You’d better hang up. Will you be home tonight?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I’ll be home.”
</p>

<p>
“Good girl. See you at six.”
</p>

<p>
Laura hung up bewildered. She felt good and she felt
lousy. Her head was throbbing but her heart was high.
She wanted to talk to Jack. She didn’t care who caught
her. She picked up the phone and dialed his office.
</p>

<p>
“I just talked to Marcie,” she said, unable to keep
the pleasure out of her voice.
</p>

<p>
He sensed her excitement. “Did she propose?” he
said, wryly amused.
</p>

<p>
“No, you idiot!” Laura burst out laughing. “She
said I was beautiful.” Unconsciously she exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
“Jesus, she has a screw loose,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“She said you were talking about me before I got
home. Thanks, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Listen, Mother,” he said. “Let’s get this straight.
I want her to think we’re nuts for each other. I also think
you’re a pretty girl, and I said so. But I didn’t say
it to get Marcie all steamed up.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="76" id="page-76"></a>
“Well, I don’t care why you did it. She is steamed
up.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re making a mountain out of a molehill.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Jack, be nice to me! I’m in love, for God’s sake!”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, you’re in love. I believe you. Worse things
have happened. I’ll have to work a drastic cure on you.”
</p>

<p>
She laughed at him. “Too late,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“You’re not going to get stabbed like I was, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
She recalled the defenseless mushroom with a little
shiver of distaste. “Don’t be morbid,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I’m a realist.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re blind. She’s falling for me. I can tell. She
must be, or she wouldn’t—” Here Sarah walked in. “Jack,
I’ll call you back,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I dare you to. Call me back this afternoon, when
you’re hung over to your knees, and tell me how much
you’re in love.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m telling you now!”
</p>

<p>
“You talk like a fish. Go on, type your damn reports.
Send some poor bastard up for TB. Or enlarged heart.
At least it’ll be a normal disease.”
</p>

<p>
She hung up with a smack. <em>He’s a morbid miserable
old man</em>, she thought. <em>I’m not that cynical yet.</em>
</p>

<p>
“Was that your friend?” Sarah said. “Jack?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” She put paper and carbons into her machine.
</p>

<p>
“He’s giving you the rush, hm?”
</p>

<p>
“I guess so.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s one of us, anyway.”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked at her, and caught an expression of
frustration on her face that made Laura’s problems seem
smaller. Sarah was plain. She was unremarkable. But
so nice. It was depressing. Laura put a hand on her
arm. It would cheer her up if she could cheer someone
else. “Maybe Jack could fix you up with a friend of
his,” she said. “We could make it a foursome.”
</p>

<p>
Sarah shook her head. “They all want to know ‘Is she
pretty?’ Never mind if she’s nice or wants a man so
badly she could ... excuse me, Laura, I sound like an
old maid already. I haven’t given up yet.”
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura studied her on the way down in the elevator.
She ached to say the things she thought, but she didn’t
know Sarah well enough. They were walled up in themselves.
<a class="pagenum" title="77" id="page-77"></a>
<em>Poor plain Sarah</em>, she thought. <em>I’m not beautiful
either. But I’ve been loved. I know love and I can tell
you, you don’t have to be a beauty to feel passion. Sometimes
it helps if you’re not. I wonder if you know that
already.</em>
</p>

<p>
“I’ll talk to Jack,” she said as they walked out.
</p>

<p>
“That’d be awfully nice, Laura.” She laughed diffidently.
“At twenty-eight you begin to feel kind of frantic,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
Outside she left Sarah and walked toward the subway
station. All the way she noticed the women, as she never
had before. She was at a loss to explain it. Before, she
had always hurried, on her way somewhere, with a
deadline to beat, somebody to meet, things on her mind.
Now—perhaps it was the fatigue that made her slow—she
sauntered, looking at the women.
</p>

<p>
Looking at their faces: sweet, fine-featured, delicate,
some of them; others coarse, sensual, heavily female.
They all appealed to her, with their soft skirts,
their clicking heels, their floating hair. It caught
in her throat, this aberration of hers, in a way it
never had until that moment. It suffused her. She surrendered
quietly to her feelings, walking slowly, looking
without staring but with a warm pleasure that
made her want to smile. She had trouble controlling
her mouth.
</p>

<p>
<em>God, I love them</em>, she thought to herself, vaguely surprised.
<em>I just love them. I love them all. I know I’m nuts,
but I love them.</em> She stopped by a jewelry window where
an exquisite girl was admiring a group of rings.
She was all in gray, as fine and soft as twilight. Gray
silk graced her slim legs, gray suede pumps with the
highest heels were on her feet. A gray suit, impeccably
tailored, terribly expensive—gray gloves—a tiny gray
hat. Laura had never liked gray much before, but suddenly
it was ideal on this cool dainty little creature,
with her small nose and moist pink lips. She was extremely
pretty. She looked up to find Laura gazing at
her, collected herself with pretty confusion, and went
off, pulling a recalcitrant gray poodle after her. Laura
had not even noticed it till it moved. She looked after
the girl for a minute with a foolish smile.
</p>

<p>
When she finally reached the subway she collapsed
<a class="pagenum" title="78" id="page-78"></a>
on a seat, exhausted. She wanted to get home and into
bed so badly that she could hardly wait.
</p>

<p>
She was late getting home but even so, Marcie had
not arrived. She wanted very much to see her, but there
was no help for it. She would have to wait. She fell on
her bed, meaning to rest for a minute before she took
her bath. But so tired was she that before five minutes
had passed she was asleep. She woke up to hear small
sounds in the bedroom, and it seemed like perhaps
half an hour had passed.
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes and found herself all tangled up in
her clothes, her shoes still on, her dress wrinkled. There
was a light on, the small table lamp between the beds.
She pulled herself up and turned around. Marcie was
standing in the bathroom door, with a frame of light
around her, holding her toothbrush and smiling at
Laura. She was all in white lace, in a short gown that
barely reached her thighs. Laura smiled at her and
blinked, shaking her head slightly.
</p>

<p>
“Know what time it is?” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“About seven.”
</p>

<p>
“Quarter of twelve.” Marcie laughed at her surprise.
She walked over to her bed and stood beside her for a moment.
She smelled gorgeous—intoxicating, sweet and
clean, faintly powdered, warm and damp from her bath.
She looked sleepy, soft, very feminine. Laura began to
tremble, desperate to touch her, afraid even to look.
</p>

<p>
“You must have been awfully tired, Laur. You’ve been
asleep for hours.”
</p>

<p>
“I could sleep till Monday and never wake up,” Laura
murmured. She spoke without looking at Marcie. She
couldn’t. The scent of her was trouble enough.
</p>

<p>
“Burr and I went out for dinner. We didn’t want to
bother you.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you have a nice big fight?” Irresistibly Laura’s
eyes traveled up Marcie to her face.
</p>

<p>
Marcie sighed. “We always have a nice big fight.”
</p>

<p>
“You must enjoy them.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie sat down beside her. “Don’t talk that way,
Laur,” she said. “I wish I could get interested in books, like
you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at her, so close, so distant.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="79" id="page-79"></a>
“Help me, Laura,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“How?” Laura felt herself on very shaky ground.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know how,” Marcie said impatiently. “If
I knew I could help myself. There must be something in
life besides fights, Laur.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t call me Laur.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie looked at her in surprise. “Why not?”
</p>

<p>
“Somebody else used to call me that. It still hurts a
little.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry. I remember, you told me about him.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt confession working itself urgently into
her thoughts. She wanted to clasp Marcie to her and
say, “Not ‘him’. Her. <em>Her.</em> It was a girl I loved. As I
love you.” <em>No, not as I love you. I can’t love you that
way, not even you.</em> To her sudden disgust the face of a
handsome arrogant girl named Beebo came up in her
mind. She frowned at her, trying not to see.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter, Laur? Laura?” Marcie smoothed
Laura’s hair off her hot forehead. “You must have
loved him a lot.”
</p>

<p>
In a sudden convulsion of desire, Laura threw her
arms around Marcie, pressing her hard, tight, in her
arms. Her need was terrible, and a sort of sob, half ache
and half passion, came out of her. Marcie was frightened.
</p>

<p>
“Laura!” she said, pushing at her. Laura was always
so docile; now suddenly she was strange and violent.
“Laura, are you all right?” Laura only clung to her
the harder, wrestling against herself with all her
strength.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, Marcie tried to calm her, whispering
soothingly and rubbing her back a little. But this
only aggravated Laura.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, don’t!” she said sharply. Panic began to
well up in her. “Oh, God!” she cried, and stood up
abruptly, shaking all over. She covered her face with
her hands, trying to force the tears back with them.
Marcie watched her, astonished, from the bed.
</p>

<p>
With a little gasp Laura turned and ran out. Marcie
rose to her feet and called after her, but it was too
late. She heard the front door slam as she ran toward it.
She pulled it open but Laura was in the elevator a floor
<a class="pagenum" title="80" id="page-80"></a>
below her and on her way out. Marcie stared into the
black stairwell, feeling shocked and confused.
</p>

<p>
She slipped back into the apartment and into her
bed, but she couldn’t sleep. She simply sat there, her
eyes wide and staring, oscillating between a fear of
something she couldn’t name and bewildered sympathy
for Laura. For whatever it was that tortured her. She
shivered every time she thought of Laura’s near-hysterical
embrace, returning to it again and again. It gave
her a reckless kick, a hint of shameless fun, like the
night she kissed the bum in the park. She didn’t know
why it recalled that to her mind. But it did. Laura
had scared her; yet now she felt like giggling.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura ran all the way to the subway station, three
blocks off. She fell into a seat gasping, trembling violently.
People stared at her but she ignored them, covering
her face with her hands and sobbing quietly.
She rode down to the Village and got off at Tenth
Street. She had managed to control herself by this time,
but she felt bewildered and lost, as if she didn’t quite
know what she was doing there. She stood for a moment
on the platform, shivering with the chilly air. It was
nearly the end of April, but it was still cold at night.
She had run out in nothing but a blouse and skirt,
with a light topper over them—the clothes she had
fallen asleep in. She was aware of the cold, yet somehow
didn’t feel it.
</p>

<p>
Resolutely she began to walk, climbing the stairs
and then starting down Seventh Avenue. She walked
as if she had a goal, precisely because she had none and
it frightened her. It was Friday night, and busy. People
were everywhere. Young men turned to stare at her.
</p>

<p>
Within five minutes she was standing in front of
The Cellar, rather surprised at herself for having found
it so quickly. There was a strange tingling up and
down her back and her eyes began to shine with a feverish
luster. She walked down the steps and pulled the
door open.
</p>

<p>
Almost nobody noticed her. It was too crowded, at
this peak hour of one of the best nights of the week.
She made her way through the crowd to the nearest end
<a class="pagenum" title="81" id="page-81"></a>
of the bar. She had to squeeze into a corner next to the
juke box and it was work to get her jacket off. It was
sweaty and close after the chill air outside.
</p>

<p>
Laura stood quietly in her corner, looking at all the
faces strung down the bar like beads on a necklace. They
were animated, young for the most part, attractive ...
There were a few that were sad, or old, or soured on life—or
all three. Across the room the artist, with his
sketch pad, was drinking with some friends.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt alone and apart from them all somehow.
There were one or two faces she might have recognized
from the night before, people Jack might have introduced
her to, but she couldn’t be sure. She had been too
drunk to be sure of anything last night.
</p>

<p>
<em>God, was it only last night?</em> she wondered. It seemed
like a thousand nights ago. She didn’t really want to
be noticed now. She only wanted to watch, to be absorbed
in these gay faces, in the idioms, the milieu.
</p>

<p>
“What’ll you have?” She realized the bartender was
leaning stiff-armed on the bar, looking at her.
</p>

<p>
“Whisky and water,” she said, wondering suddenly
how much it would be. She pulled out a dollar and put
it on the counter self-consciously. When he brought
her the drink she gulped it anxiously. Marcie kept
coming into her thoughts; Marcie’s face, her shocked
voice saying, “Laura—don’t!”
</p>

<p>
The bartender took her dollar and brought some
change. It meant she could have another drink. Drinking
your dinner. Where had she heard that? One of
her father’s friends, no doubt. She gazed at the ceiling.
She wanted to talk to Jack, but she was ashamed to call
him. She thought of her father again, and it gave her
a sort of bitter satisfaction to imagine his face if
he could see her now, alone and unhappy, disgracing
him by drinking by herself, in a bar—a gay bar. Gay—that
would strike him dead. She was sure of it. She
smiled a little, but it was a mirthless smile.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, she ordered another drink. She
counted her change fuzzily. There might be enough for
a third. She slipped it back in her pocket and looked
up to find a young man forcing himself into a place
beside her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="82" id="page-82"></a>
<em>Damn!</em> she exclaimed to herself. <em>As if I didn’t have
enough on my mind.</em> Her slim arresting face registered
subtle contempt and she turned away. It would have
frozen another man, but this one only seemed amused.
</p>

<p>
“Hello, Laura,” he said.
</p>

<p>
At this, she looked at him. Her mind was a blank;
she couldn’t place him. “Do I know you?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No.” He grinned. “I’m Dutton. This is for you.”
He held out a piece of paper and she took it, curious.
On it was a devilish reproduction of her own features
mocking her from the white page.
</p>

<p>
“You’re the artist,” she accused him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks for the compliment.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want it.”
</p>

<p>
“Keep it.”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t pay for it.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to.” He laughed at her consternation.
“It’s paid for, doll. Take it home. Frame it. Enjoy it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him. “Who paid for it?”
</p>

<p>
“She said not to tell.” He laughed. “You’re a bitch
to caricature. You know? Look me up sometime, I’ll
do a good one. I like your face.” And he turned and
wriggled out of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Laura was left standing at the bar with the cartoon
of herself. She was suddenly humiliated and angry.
She felt ridiculous standing there holding the silly
thing, not knowing who paid for it. Her glance swept
down the bar, looking for a face to accuse, but she recognized
no one. No one paid her any attention.
</p>

<p>
She studied the sketch once more. It was clever, insolent;
it made a carnival curiosity of her face. Quietly,
deliberately, with a feeling of satisfaction, she tore
the sketch in half. And in half again. And threw it down
behind the bar where the bartender would grind it into
the wet floor. Then she picked up her glass and finished
her drink.
</p>

<p>
“What did you do that for?” said a low voice, so
close to her ear that she jumped and a drop of whisky
ran down her chin. “It was a damn good likeness.”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up, gazing straight ahead of her, knowing
who it was now and mad. She pulled a dime out
of her pocket and smacked it on the bar in front of her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="83" id="page-83"></a>
“I owe you a dime, Beebo. There it is. Thanks for the
picture. Next time don’t waste your money.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed. “I always get what I pay for, lover,”
she said. Laura refused to look at her, and after a pause
Beebo said, “What’s the matter, Laura, ’fraid to look
at me?”
</p>

<p>
Laura had to look then. She turned her head slowly, reluctantly.
Her face was cold and composed. Beebo chuckled
at her. She was handsome, like a young boy of fourteen,
with her smooth skin and deep blue eyes. She was
leaning on her elbows on the bar, and she looked sly and
amused. “Laura’s afraid of me,” she said with a quick
grin.
</p>

<p>
“Laura’s not afraid of you or anybody else. Laura
thinks you’re a bitch. That’s all.”
</p>

<p>
“That makes two of us.”
</p>

<p>
Under her masklike face Laura found herself troubled
by the smile so close to her; the snapping blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Where’s your guardian angel tonight?” Beebo said.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose you mean Jack. I don’t know where he is, he
doesn’t have to tell me where he goes.” She turned back
to the bar. “He’s not my guardian angel. I don’t need one.
I’m a big girl now.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, excuse me. I should have noticed.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s cheeks prickled with embarrassment. “You only
see what you want to see,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I see what I want to see right now,” Beebo said, and
Laura felt her hand on the small of her back. She straightened
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Go away,” she said sharply. “Leave me alone.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Then shut up.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed softly. “What’s the matter, little girl?
Hate the world tonight?” Laura wouldn’t answer. “Think
that’s going to make it any prettier?” Beebo pushed
Laura’s whisky glass toward her with one finger.
</p>

<p>
“I’m having a drink for the hell of it,” Laura said
briefly. “If it bothers you, go away. You weren’t invited,
anyway.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t tell me you’re drinking just because you like
the taste.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t mind it.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="84" id="page-84"></a>
“You’re unlucky in love, then. Or you just found out
you’re gay and you can’t take it. That it?”
</p>

<p>
Laura pursed her lips angrily. “I’m not in love. I never
was.”
</p>

<p>
“You mean love is filth and all that crap? Love is
dirty?”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t say that!” Laura turned on her.
</p>

<p>
Beebo shrugged. “You’re a big girl, lover. You said it
yourself. Big girls know all about love. So don’t lie to me.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t ask you to bother me, Beebo. I don’t want to
talk to you. Now scram!”
</p>

<p>
“There she stands at the bar, drinking whisky because
it tastes good,” Beebo drawled, gazing toward the
ceiling and letting the smoke from a cigarette drift from
her mouth. “Sweet sixteen and never been kissed.”
</p>

<p>
“Twenty,” Laura snapped.
</p>

<p>
“Excuse me, twenty. Your innocence is getting tedious,
lover.” She smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, I don’t like you,” Laura said. “I don’t like the
way you dress or the way you talk or the way you wear
your hair. I don’t like the things you say and the money
you throw around. I don’t want your dimes and I don’t
want you. I hope that’s plain because I don’t know how
to make it any plainer.” Her voice broke as she talked
and toward the end she felt her own crazy tears coming
up again. Beebo saw them before they spilled over and
they changed her. They touched her. She ignored the
hard words Laura spoke for she knew enough to know
they meant nothing.
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, baby,” she said gently. “Tell me all about it.
Tell me you hate me if it’ll help.”
</p>

<p>
For a moment Laura sat there, not trusting her, not
wanting to risk a word with her, letting the stray tears roll
over her cheeks without even brushing them away. Then
she straightened up and swept them off her face with
her long slim fingers, turning away from Beebo. “I can’t
tell you, or anybody.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo shrugged. “All right. Have it your way.” She
dinched her cigarette and leaned on the bar again, her
face close to Laura’s. “Try, baby,” she said softly. “Try
to tell me.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s stupid, it’s ridiculous. We’re complete strangers.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="85" id="page-85"></a>
“We aren’t strangers.” She put an arm around Laura
and squeezed her a little. Laura was embarrassed and
grateful at the same time. It felt good, so good. Beebo
sighed at her silence. “I’m a bitch, you’re right about
that,” she admitted. “But I didn’t want to be. It’s an attitude.
You develop it after a while, like a turtle grows a
shell. You need it. Pretty soon you live it, you don’t know
any other way.”
</p>

<p>
Laura finished her drink without answering. She put it
down on the bar and looked for the bartender. She
wouldn’t care what Beebo said, she wouldn’t look at her,
she wouldn’t answer her. She didn’t dare.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t need to tell me about it,” Beebo went on.
“Because I already know. I’ve lived through it, too. You
fall in love. You’re young, inexperienced. What the hell,
maybe you’re a virgin, even. You fall, up to your ears,
and there’s nobody to talk to, nobody to lean on. You’re
all alone with that great big miserable feeling and she’s
driving you out of your mind. Every time you look at her,
every time you’re near her. Finally you give in to it—and
she’s straight.” She said the last word with such acid
sharpness that Laura jumped. “End of story,” Beebo
added. “End of soap opera. Beginning of soap opera.
That’s all the Village is, honey, just one crazy little
soap opera after another, like Jack says. All tangled up
with each other, one piled on top of the next, ad infinitum.
Mary loves Jane loves Joan loves Jean loves Beebo
loves Laura.” She stopped and grinned at Laura.
</p>

<p>
“Doesn’t mean a thing,” she said. “It goes on forever.
Where one stops another begins.” She looked around The
Cellar with Laura following her gaze. “I know most of the
girls in here,” she said. “I’ve probably slept with half of
them. I’ve lived with half of the half I’ve slept with.
I’ve loved half of the half I’ve lived with. What does it
all come to?”
</p>

<p>
She turned to Laura who was caught with her fascinated
face very close to Beebo’s. She started to back away
but Beebo’s arm around her waist tightened and kept her
close. “You know something, baby? It doesn’t matter.
Nothing matters. You don’t like me, and that doesn’t
matter. Someday maybe you’ll love me, and that won’t
matter either. Because it won’t last. Not down here. Not
<a class="pagenum" title="86" id="page-86"></a>
anywhere in the world, if you’re gay. You’ll never
find peace, you’ll never find Love. With a capital L.”
</p>

<p>
She took a drag on her cigarette and let it flow out of
her nostrils. “L for Love,” she said, looking into space.
“L for Laura.” She turned and smiled at her, a little sadly.
“L for Lust and L for the L of it. L for Lesbian. L for
Let’s—let’s,” she said, and blew smoke softly into Laura’s
ear. Laura was startled to feel the strength of the feeling
inside her.
</p>

<p>
<em>It’s the whiskey</em>, she thought. <em>It’s because I’m tired. It’s
because I want Marcie so much. No, that doesn’t make
sense.</em> She caught the bartender’s eye and he fixed her
another drink.
</p>

<p>
Beebo’s arm pressed her again. “Let’s,” she said. “How
about it?” She was smiling, not pushy, not demanding,
just asking. As if it didn’t really matter whether Laura
said yes or no.
</p>

<p>
“Where did you get that ridiculous name?” Laura
hedged.
</p>

<p>
“My family.”
</p>

<p>
“They named you <em>Beebo</em>?”
</p>

<p>
“They named me Betty Jean,” she said, smiling. “Which
is even worse.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s a pretty name.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s a lousy name. Even Mother couldn’t stand it.
And she could stand damn near anything. But they had
to call me something. So they called me Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s too bad.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed. “I get along,” she said.
</p>

<p>
The bartender set Laura’s glass down and she reached
for her change. “What’s your last name?” she said to
Beebo.
</p>

<p>
“Brinker. Like the silver skates.”
</p>

<p>
Laura counted her change. She had sixty-five cents.
The bartender was telling a joke to some people a few
seats down, resting one hand on the bar in front of Laura,
waiting for his money. She was a dime short. She
counted it again, her cheeks turning hot.
</p>

<p>
Beebo watched and began to laugh. “Want your dime
back?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“It’s your dime,” Laura said haughtily.
</p>

<p>
“You must have left home in a hurry, baby. Poor Laura.
Hasn’t got a dime for a lousy drink.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="87" id="page-87"></a>
Laura wanted to strangle her. The bartender turned
back to her suddenly and she felt her face burning. Beebo
leaned toward him, laughing. “I’ve got it, Mort,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No!” Laura said. “If you could just lend me a dime.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed and waved Mort away.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to owe you a thing,” Laura told her.
</p>

<p>
“Too bad, doll. You can’t help yourself.” She laughed
again. Laura tried to give her the change she had left,
but Beebo wouldn’t take it. “Sure, I’ll take it,” she said.
“And you’ll be flat busted. How’ll you get home?”
</p>

<p>
Laura went pale then. She couldn’t go home. Even if
she had a hundred dollars in her pocket. She couldn’t
stand to face Marcie, to explain her crazy behavior, to try
to make herself sound normal and ordinary when her
whole body was begging for strange passion, for forbidden
release.
</p>

<p>
Beebo watched her face change and then she shook her
head. “It must have been a bad fight,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve got it all wrong, Beebo. It wasn’t a fight. It
was—I don’t know what it was.”
</p>

<p>
“She straight?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know.” Laura put her forehead down on the
heel of her right hand. “Yes, she’s straight,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Well, did you tell her? About yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know if I did or not. I didn’t say it but I acted
like a fool. I don’t know what she thinks.”
</p>

<p>
“Then things could be worse,” Beebo said. “But if she’s
straight, they’re probably hopeless.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what Jack said.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack’s right.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s not in love with her!”
</p>

<p>
“Makes him even righter. He sees what you can’t see.
If he says she’s straight, believe him. Get out while you
can.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t.” Laura felt an awful twist of tenderness for
Marcie in her throat.
</p>

<p>
“Okay, baby, go home and get your heart broken. It’s
the only way to learn, I guess.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t go home. Not tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Come home with me.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Well ...” Beebo smiled. “I know a nice bench in
<a class="pagenum" title="88" id="page-88"></a>
Washington Square. If you’re lucky the bums’ll leave you
alone. And the cops.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll—I’ll go to Jack’s,” she said, suddenly brightening
with the idea. “He won’t mind.”
</p>

<p>
“He might,” Beebo said, and raised her glass to her
lips. “Call him first.”
</p>

<p>
Laura started to leave the bar and then recalled that
all her change was sitting on the counter in front of
Beebo. She turned back in confusion, her face flushing
again. Beebo turned and looked at her. “What’s the matter,
baby?” And then she laughed. “Need a dime?” She
handed her one.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, in the relative quiet of the phone booth,
Laura leaned against a wall and wondered if she might
faint. But she didn’t. She deposited the dime and dialed
Jack’s number. The phone rang nine times before he answered,
and she was on the verge of panic when she heard
him lift the receiver at last and say sleepily, “Hello?”
</p>

<p>
“Hello, Jack? Jack, this is Laura.” She was vastly relieved
to find him at home.
</p>

<p>
“Sorry, we don’t want any.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I’ve got to see you.”
</p>

<p>
“My husband contributes to that stuff at the office.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, please! It’s terribly important.”
</p>

<p>
“I love you, Mother, but you call me at the God-damnedest
times.”
</p>

<p>
“Can I come over?”
</p>

<p>
“Jesus, no!” he exclaimed, suddenly coming wide awake.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Jack, what’ll I do?” She sounded desperate.
</p>

<p>
“All right now, let’s get straightened out here. Let’s
make an effort.” He sounded as if he had drunk a lot and
just gotten to sleep, still drunk, when Laura’s call woke
him up. “Now start at the beginning. And make it quick.
What’s the problem?”
</p>

<p>
She felt hurt, slighted. Of all people, Jack was the one
she had to count on. “I—I acted like a fool with Marcie.
I don’t know what she thinks,” she half-sobbed. “Jack,
help me.”
</p>

<p>
“What did you do?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing—everything. I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“God, Mother. Why did you pick tonight? Of all
nights?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="89" id="page-89"></a>
“I didn’t pick it, it just happened.”
</p>

<p>
“<em>What</em> happened, damn it?”
</p>

<p>
“I—I sort of embraced her.”
</p>

<p>
There was a silence on the other end for a minute.
Laura heard him say away from the receiver, “Okay, it’s
okay. No, she’s a friend of mine. A friend, damn it, a
girl.” Then his voice became clear and close again.
“Mother, I don’t know what to say. I’m not sure I understand
what happened, and if I did I still wouldn’t know
what the hell to say. Where are you?”
</p>

<p>
“At The Cellar. Jack, you’ve just got to help me.
Please.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you alone?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. No. I’ve been talking to Beebo, but—”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! Well, God, that’s it, that’s the answer. Go home
with Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“No! I can’t, Jack. I want to come to your place.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura, honey—” He was wide awake now, sympathetic,
but caught in his own domestic moils. “Laura, I’m—well,
I’m entertaining.” He laughed a little at his own
silliness. “I’m involved. I’m fraternizing. Oh, hell, I’m
making love. You can’t come over here.” His voice went
suddenly in the other direction as he said, “No, calm
down, she’s not coming over.”
</p>

<p>
Then he said, “Laura, I wish I could help, honest to
God. I just can’t, not now. You’ve got to believe me.” He
spoke softly, confidentially, as if he didn’t want the other
to hear what he said. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, I’ll call
Marcie and get it straightened out. Don’t worry, Marcie
believes in me. She thinks I’m Jack Armstrong, the all-American
boy. The four-square trouble-shooter. I’ll fix it
up for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, please,” she whimpered, like a plaintive child.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll do everything I can. You just picked the wrong
night and that’s the God’s truth, honey. Where’s Beebo?
Let me talk to Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
Laura went out of the booth to get her, feeling half
dazed, and found her way back to the bar. “He wants to
talk to you,” she said to Beebo, without looking at her.
</p>

<p>
Beebo frowned at her and then swung herself off her
seat and headed for the phone. Laura sat down in her
place, disturbed by the warmth Beebo left behind, twirling
<a class="pagenum" title="90" id="page-90"></a>
her glass slowly in her hand. She was crushed that
Jack had turned her down.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he had a lover, perhaps this night was so important
to him that he couldn’t give it up, even though
she had all his sympathy. These things might be—in fact,
were—true. But Laura could hardly discern them through
her private pains.
</p>

<p>
Beebo came back in a minute and leaned over Laura,
one hand on the bar, the other on Laura’s shoulder. “He
says I’m to take you home,” she said, “feed you aspirins,
dry your tears, and put you to bed. And no monkey business.”
She smiled as Laura looked slowly up into her face.
It was a strong interesting face. With a little softness, a
little innocence, it might have been lovely. But it was too
hard and cynical, too restless and disillusioned. “Come
on, sweetie pie,” Beebo said. “I’m a nice kid, I won’t eat
you.”
</p>

<p>
They walked until they came to a small dark street,
and the second door up—dark green—faced right on the
sidewalk. Beebo opened it and they walked down a couple
of steps into a small square court surrounded by the windowed
walls of apartment buildings. On the far side was
another door with benches and play areas grouped in between
on the court. Beebo unlocked the other door and
led Laura up two flights of unlighted stairs to her apartment.
</p>

<p>
When they went inside a brown dachshund rushed to
meet them and tried to climb up their legs. Beebo laughed
and talked to him, reaching down to push him away.
</p>

<p>
Laura stood inside the door, her hands over her eyes,
somewhat unsteady on her feet.
</p>

<p>
“Here, baby, let’s get you fixed up,” Beebo said. “Okay,
Nix, down. Down!” she said sharply to the excited little
dog, and shoved him away with her foot. He slunk off to
a chair where he studied her reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
Beebo led Laura through the small living room to an
even smaller bedroom and sat her down on the bed. She
knelt in front of her and took her shoes off. Then, gently,
she leaned against her, forcing her legs slightly apart, and
put her arms around Laura’s waist. She rubbed her head
against Laura’s breasts and said, “Don’t be afraid, baby.”
Laura tried weakly to hold her off but she said, “I won’t
<a class="pagenum" title="91" id="page-91"></a>
hurt you Laura,” and looked up at her. She squeezed her
gently, rhythmically, her arms tightening and loosening
around Laura’s body. She made a little sound in her
throat and, lifting her face, kissed Laura’s neck. And then
she stood up slowly, releasing her.
</p>

<p>
“Okay,” she said. “Fini. No monkey business. Make
yourself comfortable, honey. There’s the john—old, but
serviceable. You sleep here. I’ll take the couch. Here!
Here, Nix!” She grabbed the little dog, which had
bounded onto the bed and was trying to lick Laura’s face,
and picked him up in her arms like a baby. She grinned
at Laura. “I’ll take him to bed, he won’t bother you,” she
said. “Call me if there’s anything you need.” She looked
at Laura closely while Laura tried to answer her. The
younger girl sat on the bed, pale with fatigue and hunger,
feeling completely lost and helpless. “Thanks,” she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
Beebo sat down beside her. “You look beat, honey,” she
said.
</p>

<p>
“I am.”
</p>

<p>
“Want to tell me about it now?”
</p>

<p>
Laura shook her head.
</p>

<p>
“Well ...” she said. “Goodnight, Little Bo-peep. Sleep
tight.” And she kissed her forehead, then turned around
and went out of the bedroom, turning out the light on her
way.
</p>

<p>
Laura had gotten off the bed without looking at
her, but feeling Beebo’s eyes on her. She shut the door
slowly, until she heard the catch snap. Then she turned,
leaning on the door, and looked at the room. It was small
and full of stuff, with yellowed walls. Everything looked
clean, although the room was in a state of complete confusion,
with clothes draped over chairs and drawers half
shut.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden, Laura felt stronger. She undressed
quickly, taking off everything but her nylon slip, and
pulled down the bedclothes. She climbed in gratefully.
She didn’t even try to forget Marcie or what had happened.
It would have been impossible. Mere trying would
have made it worse. She relaxed on her back in the dark,
her arms outflung, and waited for the awful scene to
come up in her mind and torture her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="92" id="page-92"></a>
Her mind wandered. The awful embrace was awful
no longer—only wrong and silly and far away. The damage
was irreparable. She stared at the ceiling, invisible
in the dark, and felt a soft lassitude come over her.
She felt as if she were melting into the bed; as if she
could not have moved if she tried.
</p>

<p>
Time flowed by and she waited for sleep. It was some
time before she realized she was actually waiting for
it. It didn’t come. She turned on her side, and still it
eluded her. Finally she snapped the light on to squint
at her watch. It said five of four. She switched it off
again, her eyes dazzled, and wondered what the matter
was. And then she heard Beebo turn over in the next
room, and she knew.
</p>

<p>
An old creeping need began to writhe in Laura, coming
up suddenly out of the past and twisting itself
around her innards. The pressure increased while she
lay there trying to ignore it, becoming more insistent.
It began to swell and fade with a rhythm of its
own; a rhythm she knew too well and feared. Slowly the
heat mounted to her face, the sweat come out on her
body. She began to turn back and forth in bed, hating herself
and trying to stop it, but helpless with it.
</p>

<p>
Laura was a sensual girl. Her whole being cried out
for love and loving. It had been denied her for over
a year, and the effects were a severe strain on her that
often brought her nerves to the breaking point. She pretended
she had learned to live with it, or rather, without
it. She even pretended she could live her whole life
without it. But in her secret self she knew she couldn’t.
</p>

<p>
Beebo turned over again in the living room and
Laura knew she was awake, too. The sudden realization
made her gasp, and she could fool herself no longer. She
wanted Beebo. She wanted a woman; she wanted a
woman so terribly that she had to put her hand tight over
her mouth to stop the groan that would have issued from
it.
</p>

<p>
For a few moments more she tossed feverishly on her
bed, trying to find solitary release, but it wouldn’t
come. The thought of Beebo tortured her now, and not
the thought of Marcie. Beebo—with her lithe body,
her fascinating face, her cynical shell. There was so
<a class="pagenum" title="93" id="page-93"></a>
much of Beth there. At that thought, Laura found herself
swinging her legs out of bed.
</p>

<p>
Moonlight glowed in two bright squares on the living
room floor. Laura could see the couch, draped in
blankets. She wondered whether Beebo had heard her and
waited breathlessly for some sign. Nix lifted his head but
made no sound, only watching her as she advanced across
the room on her tiptoes, her white slip gleaming as she
passed through the light.
</p>

<p>
Laura stood and hovered over the couch, uncertain
what to do, her heart pounding hugely against her ribs,
Beebo was on her side, turned toward Laura, apparently
asleep. Nix was snuggled into the ditch between the
back of Beebo and the back of the couch.
</p>

<p>
Beebo stirred slightly, but she didn’t open her eyes.
“Beebo,” Laura whispered, dropping to her knees and
supporting herself against the couch with her hands.
“Beebo?” she whispered again, a little louder. And
then, sensing that Beebo had heard her she bent down
and kissed her cheek, her hands reaching for her. Beebo
was suddenly completely roused, coming up on her elbow
and then falling back and pulling Laura with her.
</p>

<p>
“Laura?” she said huskily. “Are you all right?” And
then she felt Laura’s lips on her face again and a shock
of passion gripped her. “Oh, God—Oh, baby,” she said,
and her arms went around Laura hard.
</p>

<p>
“Hold me,” Laura begged, clinging to her. “Oh,
Beebo, hold me.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo rolled off the couch onto Laura and the abrupt
weight of her body fired Laura into a frenzy. They
rolled over each other on the floor, pressing each other
tight, almost as if they wanted to fuse their bodies,
and kissed each other wildly.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt such a wave of passion come up in her that
it almost smothered her. She thought she couldn’t stand
it. And then she didn’t think at all. She only clung to
Beebo, half tearing her pajamas off her back, groaning
wordlessly, almost sobbing. Her hands explored, caressed,
felt Beebo all over, while her own body responded with
violent spasms—joyous, crazy, deep as her soul. She
could no more have prevented her response than she could
the tyrannic need that drove her to find it. She felt
<a class="pagenum" title="94" id="page-94"></a>
Beebo’s tongue slip into her mouth and Beebo’s firm
arms squeezing her and she went half out of her mind
with it. Her hands were in Beebo’s hair, tickling her
ears, slipping down her back, over her hips and thighs.
Her body heaved against Beebo’s in a lovely mad duet.
She felt like a column of fire, all heat and light, impossibly
sensual, impossibly sexual. She was all feeling,
warm and melting, strong and sweet.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was a long time before either of them came to
their senses. They had fallen half asleep when it was
over, still lying on the floor, where Nix, after some trepidation,
came to join them. When Laura opened her
eyes the gray dawn had replaced the white moonlight.
She was looking out the window at a mass of telephone
and electric wires. She gazed slowly downward until
she found Beebo’s face. Beebo was awake, watching her—no
telling for how long. She smiled slightly, frowning
at the same time. But she didn’t say anything and
neither did Laura. They only pulled closer together,
until their lips touched. Beebo began to kiss Laura
over and over, little soft teasing kisses that kept out of
the way of passion, out of the way of Laura’s own kisses
as they searched for Beebo’s lips. Until it was suddenly
imperative that they kiss each other right. Laura
tried feebly to stop it, but she quickly surrendered.
When Beebo relented a little it was Laura who pulled
her back, until Beebo was suddenly crazy for her again.
</p>

<p>
“No, no, no, no,” Laura murmured, but she had asked
for it. A year and a half of abstinence was too much
for her. At that moment she was in bondage to her body.
She gave in in spite of herself, rolling over on Beebo,
her fine hair falling over Beebo’s breasts in a pale
glimmering shower, soft and cool and bringing up
the fire in Beebo again.
</p>

<p>
Once again they rested, half sleeping, turning now
and then to feel each other, reassure themselves that the
other was still there, still responsive. Now and then
Beebo pushed Nix off Laura, or out from between them,
where he was anxious to make himself a nest.
</p>

<p>
It was Saturday afternoon before they could drag themselves
off the floor. It was Laura who pulled herself to
<a class="pagenum" title="95" id="page-95"></a>
her knees first by the aid of a handy chair, and
squinted at the bright daylight. For a few moments
she remained there, swaying slightly, trying to think
straight and not succeeding. She felt Beebo’s hand brush
across her stomach and looked down at her. Beebo smiled
a little.
</p>

<p>
An elusive feeling of shame slipped through Laura,
disappeared, came back again, faded, came back. It
seemed uncertain whether or not to stay. She swallowed
experimentally, looking at Beebo. After a minute
Beebo said, “Who’s Beth?”
</p>

<p>
“Beth?” Laura was startled.
</p>

<p>
“Um-hm. She the blonde?”
</p>

<p>
“No. That’s Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, baby, seems to me like it’s Beth you’re after,
not Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
Laura frowned at her. “I haven’t seen Beth for almost
a year. She’s married now. It’s all over.”
</p>

<p>
“For her, maybe.”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t discuss it,” she said haughtily, getting up
and walking away from her, while Beebo lay on the
floor admiring her body, her head propped comfortably
on her hands. “It happened long ago and I’ve forgotten
it.”
</p>

<p>
“Then how come you called me Beth all night?”
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped, turning to look at her, and then her
face went pink. “I—I’m sorry, Beebo,” she said. “I
won’t do it again.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t count on it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stamped her foot. “Damn you, Beebo!” she said.
“Don’t talk to me as if I were an irresponsible child!”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed, rolling over and nearly crushing Nix,
who reacted by licking her frantically and wagging
his tail. Beebo squashed him in a hug, still laughing.
Laura turned on her heel to leave the room, looking back
quickly to grab her slip, and went into the bedroom,
slamming the door. Within seconds it flew open again
and Beebo leaned against the jamb, smiling at her.
She sauntered into the room.
</p>

<p>
“Now, don’t tell me you didn’t enjoy yourself last
night, Little Bo-peep,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura ignored her, moving speedily, suddenly embarrassed
<a class="pagenum" title="96" id="page-96"></a>
to be naked. In the heat of passion it was glorious,
but in the morning, in the gray light, in the
chill and ache of waking up, she hated it. Her own
bare flesh seemed out of place. Not so with Beebo, who
sprawled on the bed on top of the underwear Laura
wanted to put on.
</p>

<p>
“Did you?” said Beebo. “Enjoy yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“Get up, Beebo, I want to get dressed.”
</p>

<p>
“After all, it was your idea, baby.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t throw <em>that</em> in my face!” she exclaimed angrily,
ashamed to remember it.
</p>

<p>
“Why not? It’s true. Besides I’m not throwing it in
your face, I’m just saying it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned away from her, unbearably conscious of
her own slim behind, her dimpled rump, and her long
limbs. She yearned to be shrouded in burlap. “Beebo, I—I
couldn’t help myself last night.” She worked to control
her voice, to be civilized about it. “I needed—I
mean—it had been so long.”
</p>

<p>
“Since Beth?”
</p>

<p>
Laura fought down a sudden impulse to strangle her.
“I was a fool,” she said, and her voice trembled. “A
fool with my roommate and now with you. It got so I
couldn’t stand it at home. It got intolerable.”
</p>

<p>
“So you came down here. And I was a nice convenient
safety-valve.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t mean that!” she flared.
</p>

<p>
“Doesn’t matter what you mean, baby. It’s a fact. Here
you were, desperate. And here was I, ready and willing.
You knew I wouldn’t turn you down.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s face began to burn. She had a wild idea that
her back was blushing with her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
“What would you have done if I <em>had</em> turned you
down, Laura?” Beebo spoke softly, insinuatingly, teasing
Laura, enjoying herself.
</p>

<p>
But Laura was too humiliated to tease back. “I don’t
know,” she exclaimed miserably. “I don’t know what I
<em>could</em> have done.” And she covered her face with her
hands.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll tell you, then. You’d have begged me. You’d have
gotten down on your knees and begged me. Sometime
you will, too. Wait and see.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="97" id="page-97"></a>
Laura whirled toward her, insulted. “That’s enough!”
she said harshly. She pulled her underthings forcibly
from under Beebo, but Beebo caught the shoulder strap
of her brassiere and hung on to it with both hands, her
heels braced against the floor, laughing like a beautiful
savage while Laura yanked furiously at it.
</p>

<p>
“You’re going to get about half,” she said. “If you’re
lucky. I’ll get the other half. Half isn’t going to hold
much of you up, baby.”
</p>

<p>
Laura let go suddenly, and Beebo fell back on the bed,
grinning at her.
</p>

<p>
“Laura hates me,” she said. “Laura hates me.” She
said it slowly, singsong, daring Laura to answer her.
</p>

<p>
Laura glared at her, defiant and fuming. “You’re an
animal!” she hissed at her.
</p>

<p>
“Sure.” Beebo chuckled. “Ask Jack. That’s his favorite
word. We’re all animals.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re nothing but a dirty animal!”
</p>

<p>
“What were you last night, Miss Prim? You were
panting at me like a sow in rutting season.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s eyes went wide with fury. She grabbed the
nearest thing—a hairbrush—and flung it violently at
Beebo. Beebo ducked, laughing again at her young victim,
and Laura turned and fled into the bathroom. She
slammed the door so hard it bounced open and she had
to shut it again. With frantic fingers she tried to
turn the lock, but Beebo was already pushing on the
other side. Laura heaved against it, but Beebo got it
open and she fell back against the wall, suddenly frightened.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t touch me!” she spat at her.
</p>

<p>
Beebo smiled. “Why not? You didn’t mind last
night. I touched you all over. Did I miss anything?”
</p>

<p>
Laura shrank from her. “Let me go, Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“Let you go? I’m not even touching you.”
</p>

<p>
“I want to leave. I want to get out of here.” Laura
tried to push past her but Beebo caught her, her strong
hands pressing painfully into Laura’s shoulders, and
threw her back against the wall.
</p>

<p>
“You’re not going anywhere, Bo-peep,” she said. And
began to kiss her. Laura fought her, half sobbing, groaning,
furious. Beebo’s lips were all over her face, her
<a class="pagenum" title="98" id="page-98"></a>
throat, her breasts, and she took no notice of Laura’s
blows and her sharp nails. Laura grabbed handfuls of her
hair, wanting to tear it out, but Beebo pulled her close,
panting against her, her eyes hypnotically close to
Laura’s. And Laura felt her knees go weak.
</p>

<p>
“No,” she whispered. “Oh, God no. Oh, Beebo.” Her
hands caressed Beebo’s hair, her lips parted beneath
Beebo’s. All the lonely months of denial burst like firecrackers
between her legs. Once it had started her whole
body begged for release. It betrayed her. She clung sweating
and heaving to Beebo. They were both surprised
at the strength and insistence of their feelings. They
had felt the attraction from the first, but they had been
unprepared for the crescendo of emotion that followed.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before either of them heard the
phone ringing. Finally Beebo stood up, looking down
at Laura, watching her. Laura turned her face away,
pulling her knees up and feeling the tears come. Beebo
knelt beside her then, the hardness gone from her face.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t cry, baby,” she said, and kissed her gently.
“Laura, don’t cry. I know you don’t want to make love
to me, I know you <em>have</em> to. Damn that phone! It’s not
your fault. Laura, baby, you make beautiful love. God
grant me a passionate girl like you just once in a
while and I’ll die happy.”
</p>

<p>
“Please don’t touch me. Don’t talk to me.” She was
overwhelmed with shame.
</p>

<p>
“I have to. I can’t help myself any more than you can.
I had no idea you’d be like this—Jesus, so hot! You
look so cool, so damn far above the rest of us. But you’re
not, poor baby. Better than some of us, maybe, but not
above us.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned her face to the wall. “Answer the phone,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
Beebo left her then and went into the living room.
Laura could hear her voice when she answered.
</p>

<p>
“Hello?” she said. “How are you, doll? Fine. Laura’s
fine. No, I didn’t rape her. She raped me.” Laura sat
straight up at this, her face flaming. Beebo was laughing.
“Tell her what? It’s all fixed up? You mean I can
send her home to Marcie?” Her voice became heavily
sarcastic. “Well, isn’t that too sweet for words. Okay,
<a class="pagenum" title="99" id="page-99"></a>
Jack, I’ll tell her. You what?... With who?... Oh,
Terry! Yeah, I’ve seen him. You got a live one there,
boy. Hang on to him, he’s a doll ... Okay, don’t mention
it. It’s been a pleasure. Most of it. She’s lovely ...
So long.”
</p>

<p>
When Beebo returned to the bathroom, Laura was
standing at the washbowl, rinsing her face, trying to
compose herself.
</p>

<p>
“What did he say?” she asked Beebo.
</p>

<p>
“It was Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“I heard.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo put her arms around Laura from behind, leaning
a little against her, front to back, planting kisses
in her hair while she talked. “He says you’re forgiven.
He handed Marcie some psychological hocus pocus
about a neurosis. You are neurotic, love. As of now. As
far as Marcie’s concerned, you have attacks. She should
have a few herself.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be so sarcastic, Beebo. If you knew what I’ve
been through—how scared I was—”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, no more sarcasm. For a few minutes at least.
God, you’re pretty, Laura.” Like Jack, like Marcie,
like many others, she realized it slowly. Laura’s singular
face fit no pattern. It had to be discovered. Laura
herself had never discovered it. She didn’t believe in
it. She grew up convinced she was as plain as her
father seemed to think, and when she looked into the
mirror she didn’t see her own reflection. She saw what
she thought she looked like; a mask, a cliche left over
from adolescence. It embarrassed her when people told
her she was pretty.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t flatter me,” she said sharply to Beebo. “I hate
it.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo shut her eyes and laughed in Laura’s ear.
“You’re nuts,” she said. “You are <em>nuts</em>, Bo-peep.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m sane. And I’m plain. There’s a poem for you.
Now let me go.”
</p>

<p>
“There’s no rush, baby.”
</p>

<p>
“There is. I want to get home.” She twisted away
from Beebo, turning around to face her.
</p>

<p>
Beebo let her hands trail up the front of Laura. “Home
to Marcie?” she said, and let them drop suddenly.
<a class="pagenum" title="100" id="page-100"></a>
“Okay. Go home. Go home, now that you can stand it
for another couple of days. And when the pressure gets
too great, come back down again. Come back to Beebo,
your faithful safety valve.”
</p>

<p>
“You said you wouldn’t be sarcastic.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo wheeled away, walking into the bedroom.
“What do you want me to do, sing songs? Write poems?
Dance? Shall I congratulate you? Congratulations,
Laura, you’ve finally found a way to beat the problem.
Every time Marcie sexes you up, run down to Beebo’s
and let it off. Beebo’ll fix you up. Lovely arrangement.”
</p>

<p>
She turned to Laura, her eyes narrowed. “Laura gets
loved up for free, Beebo gets a treat, and Marcie stays
pure. Whatever happens, let’s not dirty Marcie up. Let’s
not muss up that gorgeous blonde hair.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t talk about her!” Laura had followed her into
the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, don’t get me wrong, Bo-peep. I’m not complaining.
You’re too good to me, you know. You give me
your throw-away kisses. I get your cast-off passion, I’m
your Salvation Army, doll, I get all the left-overs. Throw
me a bone.” She was sitting on the edge of her rump on
her dresser, legs crossed at the ankles, arms folded on her
chest—a favorite stance with her.
</p>

<p>
Laura was suddenly ashamed of the way she had used
Beebo. Beebo was hurt. And it was Laura’s fault.
</p>

<p>
“Everything’s my fault, Beebo,” she said. “I’m sorry.”
There was silence for a minute. Laura was acutely aware
that “I’m sorry” was no recompense for what she was
doing to Beebo.
</p>

<p>
Beebo smiled wryly. “Thanks,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I am, Beebo. Really. I didn’t come to you last night
just because of Marcie.” It was suffocatingly hard to
talk. She spoke in fits and starts as her nerve came and
left her.
</p>

<p>
“No?” Beebo remained motionless with a ‘tell-me-another’
look on her face.
</p>

<p>
“No. I came—I came because—” She covered her face
with her hands, stuck for words and ashamed.
</p>

<p>
“You came, baby. That’s enough,” Beebo finished
for her, relenting a little. “You came and I’m not sorry.
Neither are you, not really. The situation isn’t perfect.”
<a class="pagenum" title="101" id="page-101"></a>
She laughed. “But last night was perfect. It isn’t
like that very often, I can tell you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked at her again. Then she moved toward
her clothes, afraid to stay naked any longer, afraid the
whole thing would start over again.
</p>

<p>
Beebo came toward her, pulling the slip from her
hand and dropping it on the floor. “There’s no hurry,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“I’m going, Beebo. Don’t try to stop me.”
</p>

<p>
For a moment Beebo didn’t answer. Then she scooped
up some of Laura’s clothes on her foot and flung them at
her. “Okay, baby,” she said. “But next time, you don’t
get off so easily. Clear?”
</p>

<p>
“There won’t be a next time.” Laura concentrated
on dressing, on getting her body covered as quickly as
possible. “I’m grateful to you, but I’ll never do it again.
It isn’t fair, not to you.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed disagreeably. “Don’t worry about being
fair to <em>me</em>, baby. It didn’t bother you last night.”
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t think last night! You know that.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I know that. I’m glad. I hope I drive you out of
your mind.” Beebo’s eyes bored into her and made her
rush and stumble. She was afraid to confront her, and
when she had her clothes on she caught her jacket up
with one hand and headed for the door without looking
back.
</p>

<p>
Nix pranced after her. Before she got the front door
open, Beebo caught her and turned her around. “Goodby,
Beebo,” she said stiffly.
</p>

<p>
Beebo smiled, upsetting Laura with her nude closeness.
“You’ll be back, Little Bo-peep. You know that,
don’t you.” It was a statement, not a question.
</p>

<p>
<em>I’ll never come back</em>, she told herself. <em>I’ll never open
this door again.</em>
</p>

<p>
And, confident that she meant what she said, she turned
and walked away. Within minutes she was riding uptown
on the subway. In less than half an hour she was climbing
the flight of stairs to the penthouse, her heart pounding.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The door was open. Laura went in, feeling her legs start
to shake. There didn’t seem to be anyone around. She
walked through the apartment: no-one. She slipped her
<a class="pagenum" title="102" id="page-102"></a>
jacket off and went into the kitchen to find something
for breakfast. Out on the roof she could hear people laughing,
while competing portable radios squeaked from different
corners. The population of the apartment building
had taken to sunning itself on the roof on fair weekends.
</p>

<p>
Laura ate some toast and orange juice, sitting quietly,
on the kitchen table. <em>She’s out there on the porch. I
know she’s out there</em>, she told herself. She was afraid to
face her, afraid to go looking for her. She wanted to fall
into bed and sleep, but she knew she would never rest
until the thing was straightened out.
</p>

<p>
Laura emptied her orange juice glass and put it down
resolutely on the table. She set her chin and slipped off
the table, heading for the door. She bumped flat into
Jack as he came in.
</p>

<p>
Laura gave a little scream and jumped backwards. “Oh,”
she said, shutting her eyes for a minute to let her heart
come back to normal. “It’s you.”
</p>

<p>
“Say it like you’re glad to see me, Mother,” he said,
smiling wistfully.
</p>

<p>
“I am,” she exclaimed, coming toward him then and
taking his hands. “Oh, Jack, I am. I don’t know what I
would have done—”
</p>

<p>
“Now you’re embarrassing me,” he said. “They’re out
on the roof sunbathing, by the way.”
</p>

<p>
“They?”
</p>

<p>
“Burr’s here.”
</p>

<p>
Laura started for the door, but Jack caught her sleeve.
“Are you cracked?” he said. “This isn’t the time. Wait
till Burr leaves.” Laura stopped, unsure. “You don’t want
to go out there and try to explain it to her now, do you?”
Jack said.
</p>

<p>
“I just want to get it over with.”
</p>

<p>
“It’ll keep. Don’t be pushy.”
</p>

<p>
Laura rubbed her forehead. “You’re right,” she said. “I
can’t talk to her in front of Burr.” She laughed a little. “I
<em>am</em> cracked. People have been telling me that all day.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to say much anyway,” Jack said. “I did
a smooth patch job. She thinks you’re a little goofy. But
harmless.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at him in relief. But as they gazed at
each other the ghost of Beebo came up in her mind and
<a class="pagenum" title="103" id="page-103"></a>
she was suddenly blushing without Jack’s having said a
word. “I—I think I’d better go in and lie down, if you’ll
excuse me,” she said, anxious to get away from him.
</p>

<p>
“Didn’t get much sleep last night?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Not much.” She looked at the floor, not quite forgiving
him for leaving her in the lurch the night before.
“You sent me home with her,” she reminded him.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t send you to bed with her. I gave her orders.
I told her no monkey business. She promised to behave.”
He was still smiling, curious to hear her defend herself.
</p>

<p>
Laura wondered quickly whether she could get away
with a lie, ashamed as she was of the truth. But she knew
her hot cheeks would betray her. They always did.
</p>

<p>
“She did behave, Jack.” His eyebrows went up skeptically.
“She—what I mean is—it was me.”
</p>

<p>
He looked at her sideways. “You mean you just sort of
fell into each other’s arms?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, sort of.”
</p>

<p>
“By mistake? In the dark?”
</p>

<p>
“I—I—”
</p>

<p>
“You’re fibbing. I know Beebo. Who made who?” He
opened the ice box and fished out a beer. “Do I have to
say it, or are you going to tell me?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, damn it, who are you?” she exclaimed. “You
have no right to know anything.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay. I’ll get it from Beebo. She says you raped her.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s a liar! I heard her say that. Damn!”
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed, opening the beer. He sniffed it. “God,
what awful stuff,” he remarked. “I only drink it before
noon. Cheers.” He drank, and held the can toward her.
“Want some?”
</p>

<p>
“At this hour?”
</p>

<p>
“Your stomach doesn’t know what time it is.”
</p>

<p>
“<em>Your</em> stomach, maybe.”
</p>

<p>
“Did Beebo jump you, Laura? If she did I’ll break her
head.” He asked it suddenly and quietly, and she saw
that he meant help and comfort to her. He had to stick a
few pins in her, only to pull them out and offer first
aid. It was the way he did things.
</p>

<p>
“She didn’t—no,” Laura said, turning away. “Jack,
don’t make me talk about it.”
</p>

<p>
“You could talk to me before.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="104" id="page-104"></a>
“You turned me down last night,” she said pettishly.
</p>

<p>
“I had to. There was someone else last night.”
</p>

<p>
“I ... oh damn it, Jack, I’m ashamed of myself. It
was my fault, I made it so easy. No, that’s a lie. I did it
on purpose.” A wave of tears welled through her and subsided,
leaving her with her hands over her face. Jack
started to speak but she silenced him with a wave of her
hand. “It’s been so long, Jack. It’s been hell. I’ve been so
lonely. I didn’t know a person could be that lonely and
live. And then I moved in with Marcie and it was suddenly
torture. All these months I’ve been here. And most
of the time I’ve been dying for her. And last night—I was
so tired, so mixed up and I had a couple of drinks—”
</p>

<p>
“You sounded nuts on the phone.”
</p>

<p>
“I felt nuts. I felt awful. She took me home, and she
was very decent. She really was. She wanted to, I know
that. But she didn’t. She gave me her bed and she went
in the living room and slept on the couch. I thought I’d
fall right to sleep. But I couldn’t. I just tossed and turned,
and every time I heard her turn over I was on fire. It
got too strong for me. I finally gave in. <em>I</em> did it. It was
my fault, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor Laura.” He said it sympathetically. “Come here,
honey.” He put his arms around her and held her, stroking
her back. When he did it, she didn’t mind. She’d have
resented any other man ... except maybe Merrill Landon.
But Merrill Landon never showed affection to anyone.
</p>

<p>
“I know how it is, believe me,” Jack said. “You’re
starving, and somebody puts a feast in front of you. What
happens after that is Instinct. Overwhelming. You eat. Or
you die of hunger, right there, with all that food in front
of you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura clung to him, letting herself cry softly and gratefully
into his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Let me give you just one little word of advice, Mother.
Don’t starve yourself anymore. Or that hunger is going
to kill you.”
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with wet eyes. Her face was strangely
different, and Jack could see it. A night of love, a night
of luxurious satiation, had changed her. For all her fatigue,
her shame at herself, her body was happy and relieved.
She couldn’t help that. She felt physically good,
<a class="pagenum" title="105" id="page-105"></a>
for the first time in over a year, and she had Beebo to
thank for it.
</p>

<p>
“You’re different,” Jack said, smiling. “You look good.
I don’t care how tired you are. It’s becoming—love.”
</p>

<p>
“That wasn’t love.”
</p>

<p>
“What was it, then?”
</p>

<p>
“Just purely physical. Animal. Vulgar.”
</p>

<p>
“Love has a body, Laura. Eyes and lips, legs and sex.
We humans can’t help that.”
</p>

<p>
“Love is bigger and better than that. There hasn’t been
any of that with Marcie and me, but I love her.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s idealistic crap.”
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped, her eyes widening in sudden anger, but
he interrupted her sharp retort before she could make it.
</p>

<p>
“Love is no bigger and better than the people who feel
it,” he said. “What has your love for Marcie got you? A
fat neurosis, a lot of misery, and a night in bed with somebody
you hardly know because you couldn’t stand it any
longer. If that’s what makes it bigger and better, the hell
with it. Feed it to the crocodiles.” And he turned brusquely
away.
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him, unable to answer him. It struck
her harshly that he might be right. “But I love Marcie,”
she whispered hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
“Sure. You love her because she looks like Beth, or
whatever the hell her name is.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was shocked. “No, no, Jack you don’t understand.
That has nothing to do with it. I love her.” He turned
to look at her, cynicism written plain on his face. “I love
her because—”
</p>

<p>
“Because she’s under the same roof with you, two feet
away when you go to bed at night. Because she’s young
and pretty. Because you can’t have her.”
</p>

<p>
“Because I can’t have her!” she exclaimed contemptuously.
“That’s exactly why I’m so miserable, you idiot!
I love her so much—”
</p>

<p>
“We all do. She’s a great girl,” he said, so vaguely and
quietly, that it calmed her a little.
</p>

<p>
But when Marcie said, “What are you two talking
about?” Laura jumped, visibly startled. “Oh, I didn’t
mean to scare you,” Marcie said. She had made up her
mind to treat Laura gently and carefully. Burr came in
<a class="pagenum" title="106" id="page-106"></a>
noisily behind her. “Hi, Laura,” he said, and stared at
her pale face.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t hear you coming,” Laura said nervously. She
wondered what Marcie had told Burr, and suddenly it
was too much to stand there and face them. “I’m going
to bed,” she said suddenly, briefly. “I didn’t sleep much
last night.” It came to her then that she didn’t know what
she was supposed to have done last night at all. Jack
hadn’t told her.
</p>

<p>
Jack, faster than Laura when he was on the spot, said,
“Laura spent the night with Beebo Brinker. She’s an old
friend of mine.” He spoke to Burr who apparently didn’t
know what to think.
</p>

<p>
<em>Damn Jack!</em> Laura thought. <em>He didn’t have to say her
name. That ridiculous name!</em>

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">arcie</span> tried to be understanding with Laura when they
were alone later. She said, “Jack told me all about it,
Laura. I understand.”
</p>

<p>
<em>What did he tell you? What do you understand? Why
didn’t he tell me?</em> She didn’t know how to act with
Marcie. Her discomfort made her awkward and for the
first time she found herself wishing to be without her
for a little while. She didn’t want Marcie to try to comfort
her. She just wanted to let it blow over.
</p>

<p>
But Marcie was a warm-natured girl, and she was curious.
She wanted to sit on Laura’s bed and talk about it.
She kept saying, “Tell me about it, Laur. Tell me what
happened. Don’t you know I wouldn’t be shocked?”
</p>

<p>
At this point Laura revolted. “No, I <em>don’t</em> know!” she
said, and was immediately sorry. She raised her hand to
her mouth. “Marcie, please. Please drop it.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry, Laur. I can’t do anything right tonight.”
She looked so disheartened that Laura had to smile at her
a little.
</p>

<p>
“You do everything right, Marcie,” she said soothingly.
“I’m the one who’s wrong. No, it’s true. I’m not like you.
I can’t confess to people.”
</p>

<p>
“You tell Jack things.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was suddenly alert, alarmed. “How do you
know?” she demanded. “What things?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you’re always going off and talking. Like this
morning. Why don’t you have long talks with me?”
</p>

<p>
Laura sighed, relieved. “I don’t know. Jack is so easy to
talk to, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“Does that mean I’m not? I try to be.” She smiled invitingly.
</p>

<p>
Laura, who had been lying on her bed, raised herself
up on her elbows. “I never say these things like I mean
them,” she apologized. “I only mean, I—” <em>I can’t talk
to you because I’m in love with you, that’s what I mean.
But that’s not what I can say.</em>
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="108" id="page-108"></a>
She rolled over on her stomach and buried her face in
the pillow. Marcie sat motionless for a minute, afraid to
say anything and start her off again. Then she leaned
over her and touched her shoulders. “You don’t have to
tell me, Laura, honey,” she said. “I guess I shouldn’t
pester you. Jack says you’ve been through a lot and that’s
why you’re nervous. I don’t want to make you unhappy,
Laura. I’m afraid I do sometimes. I don’t know why, I
just get the feeling now and then, when you look at me,
that I make you sad. Do I?”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s nails cut into her smooth white forehead.
“Marcie, don’t torture me,” she said. Her voice was low
and strained. It was such an odd thing to say that Marcie
withdrew, and climbed into her own bed.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry,” she whispered, pulling the covers up and
turning out the light. Then she put her hands over her
face suddenly and sobbed.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Marcie!” Laura was out of bed before she had
time to think, sitting next to Marcie and holding her.
“Don’t cry, Marcie. Oh God, why can’t I ever say anything
right?” She implored the ceiling for an answer. “I
didn’t mean to hurt you.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie slowed down and stopped almost as suddenly as
she began. “I know,” she said. “I know what it is. I used
to drive Burr nuts this way, asking questions and talking
and talking. And when he wouldn’t answer, I just kept
asking more and more till I drove him crazy. I don’t
know why. I guess I <em>wanted</em> to drive him crazy. But I
don’t know why I do it to you.” She looked away, embarrassed.
Laura’s arms tightened involuntarily around
her. She had no idea how to answer this unexpected outburst.
She was afraid to try to comfort Marcie, for the
very act of soothing her brought Laura’s own emotions to
a boil. The safest course was to get back in bed at once
and forget it. Or at least, stop talking. But Marcie was
clinging to her and she couldn’t roughly shake her off.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve learned a lot from living with you, Laur,” Marcie
said quietly. Laura listened, her nostrils full of the scent
of flowers. “This may sound silly to you but—don’t take
this wrong, Laura—but I admire you, I really do. You
have a quality of self control that I could never learn.
You keep your thoughts to yourself. If you don’t have
<a class="pagenum" title="109" id="page-109"></a>
anything to say, you don’t <em>say</em> anything. If you don’t want
to talk, you don’t.”
</p>

<p>
She looked up and laughed a little ruefully. “I talk all
the time, as if I had to. Just living with you, I’m beginning
to see it. I talk all the time and say nothing. You
almost never talk, but when you do it’s worth listening to.”
</p>

<p>
Laura began to squirm uncomfortably, but Marcie
grasped her sleeves and continued. “You know something,
Laur? I think I just drove Burr crazy. I talked him to
death.”
</p>

<p>
“He still loves you, Marcie.” Laura found her hand on
Marcie’s hair, without quite knowing how she had let it
happen. “He wants you back.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. We’ve hardly quarreled at all this week, Laur.
You haven’t been around much, you haven’t seen us. But
we’ve been getting along unusually well. But the screwy
part is, it’s not like I thought it would be.”
</p>

<p>
“You mean, you miss the quarrels?”
</p>

<p>
“I mean I just wish he wouldn’t come around so much
any more. I want time to change. To think.”
</p>

<p>
“Think about what?”
</p>

<p>
“About me. No, about anything <em>but</em> me. That’s all I
ever thought about before. You think about other things.
You know what’s going on. You come home at night and
you read all these books that are sitting around. You
can’t even talk to me about them, because you know how
stupid I am.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was astonished. All these critical thoughts had
gone through Marcie’s head, and Laura hadn’t been
aware of it. Marcie had been watching her, admiring her,
and she hadn’t known that either. <em>I’m plumb blind</em>, she
thought. <em>And I thought I couldn’t know Marcie any better.
Because I love her. And she talks like this to me.
God!</em>
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, you don’t need to read books. It’s just a bad
habit for introverts.” Marcie shook her head silently while
Laura went on. “Beautiful girls like you don’t need to
read,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“That’s just it,” Marcie said. “I’m not going to be just
another pretty idiot. I want to know something. I’m sick
of knowing absolutely nothing. I want to be different.
I want you to help me.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="110" id="page-110"></a>
<em>She wants me</em>, Laura thought happily. <em>She wants me.</em>
It was all she heard.
</p>

<p>
“When you were gone all night with Jack—” She
paused and looked away. “—I started to think.
I couldn’t sleep, I don’t know why. I was thinking about
you, Laur. I was wondering why you never talk to me,
why we have so little to say to each other. We sit at the
breakfast table and read the paper and go off without
anything more than ‘good morning’. At night we go to
bed and sometimes I talk, but it’s not a conversation. You
listen, I guess you listen.”
</p>

<p>
“I do!”
</p>

<p>
“And I say the wrong things. And you go to pieces,
like Friday night.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Or else you run away. You go sleep with Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie!”
</p>

<p>
“I know you were with Jack again last night. He didn’t
have to lie to me about it.”
</p>

<p>
“But he didn’t. I wasn’t!”
</p>

<p>
“Now don’t <em>you</em> lie to me!”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at her, unable to speak.
</p>

<p>
“Help me, Laura,” Marcie said, leaning toward her. “I
want to change. I’m sick of myself. I’m sick of Burr.”
</p>

<p>
The strangest craziest feeling started up in Laura; just
an echo, faraway in herself. <em>She wants me to help her,
to be with her. She admires me. Dear God, I’m afraid
to wonder how much.</em> A very small smile curved the corners
of her mouth.
</p>

<p>
“I have to start somewhere,” Marcie said. “I want to
talk to you like an intelligent human being, not an
ignoramus.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at her. Almost without her realizing it,
her hand had stolen back to Marcie’s yellow hair. “Do
you, Marcie?” she said. It was a simple question, but it
asked a thousand others.
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I’m fed up with myself. I never realized, till I
lived day-in-day-out with you, how much I’d been missing.
Give me a book to read, Laur.”
</p>

<p>
“In the morning.” Laura smiled at her and got up, edging
away from her bed.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="111" id="page-111"></a>
“Now.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s too late, Marcie. You won’t read anything now.”
</p>

<p>
“I want to tell Burr I read a book.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll give you something later,” Laura said. It sounded
strangely insinuating, the way she said it. She scared herself.
She ducked into her bed as into a safe harbor, and
hid her body under the blankets.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh Marcie turned the light out. After a moment’s
silence she whispered, “Laur? Will you talk to me
after this? Really talk to me? Tell me things?”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll try,” Laura murmured, frowning in the dark. She
lay in bed daydreaming for hours, seeing the first signs
in Marcie of an influence she had been unaware of.
Where would it lead? What doors would it open? Would
it lead them both to bitterness? Or mutual ecstasy?
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In the morning Laura was very matter-of-fact. She almost
ignored Marcie. She made her work for her attention
and it delighted her that Marcie was willing to work
for it. Instinctively Laura knew she had to play hard to
get, and she liked to play that way for once.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast, after a few false starts, Marcie blurted,
“I’ll be late tonight.” She put her paper down and faced
Laura.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up slowly. “Date with Burr?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No. Mr. Marquardt is having some out-of-town guests
for dinner downtown. He asked some of us to go. I told
him I would.”
</p>

<p>
“Have fun,” Laura said, and looked back at the front
page.
</p>

<p>
“Ha! Some drunken idiot of a reporter’ll probably
pester me to death.”
</p>

<p>
“A reporter?” Laura looked up again suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t know.” Marcie saw Laura’s interest and it
sparked her own. “A journalist, or something. It’s a convention—professional
fraternity, I guess.”
</p>

<p>
“What fraternity? What’s it called?”
</p>

<p>
“Ummm.” Marcie bit her lip and concentrated. “It’s
Greek. Let’s see. Something the matter?”
</p>

<p>
“No. Is it Chi Delta—”
</p>

<p>
“—Sigma. That’s it, I remember. How did you know?
Now something <em>is</em> the matter, Laura!”
</p>

<p>
Laura had gone very pale. She swallowed convulsively.
<a class="pagenum" title="112" id="page-112"></a>
“I just remembered, I was supposed to run an errand for
Dr. Hollingsworth. I’d better get going.” She got up suddenly
and went into the bedroom for her jacket.
</p>

<p>
Marcie stood up and followed her. “You didn’t finish
your breakfast, Laur,” she said, concerned, a line of worry
in her forehead.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not hungry. I’ll see you tonight,” she said, and
turned quickly to almost run out.
</p>

<p>
Marcie came after her, bewildered. “Laura, you don’t
make sense,” she said. “What’s the matter with you?”
</p>

<p>
But Laura was running down the stairs to the elevator.
Marcie turned and went back into the kitchen and drank
her coffee standing, gazing perplexed at Laura’s plate.

Chapter Ten
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">errill</span> Landon. <em>Merrill Landon. My father. My father
is coming to New York. He never misses these damn
things, he goes every year. Oh, God, help me.</em> Laura rode
down to work on the subway, her fists clenched in her
lap, her face set like a mask to cover the torment inside.
</p>

<p>
<em>He doesn’t know I’m here, that’s one good thing. He’ll
never find me, either. How long will he be here? It must
be in the papers. I missed it at breakfast.</em>
</p>

<p>
She picked up the <em>Times</em> on the corner where she left
the subway. She took it up to the office with her, impatient
to look at it. Sarah was already there.
</p>

<p>
“Hi, gorgeous,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up, startled. “Hi,” she said. “Who’s gorgeous?”
</p>

<p>
“You are. You must be, you’ve got a man.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at her blankly, her mind full of the threat
of her father’s presence in the city. Finally it came to her.
“Oh, you mean Jack,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Did you talk to him?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes. Yes.” <em>Now what the hell does she mean? Why
would I—Oh! I promised her a date.</em> Laura felt suddenly
sunk. All those reports to do that should have been
done before. Lies to tell, at nine in the morning. Merrill
Landon somewhere in New York. It was too much. The
day stretched away in front of her like an endless obstacle
course.
</p>

<p>
“What’d he say?” Sarah said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
“He’s working on it. Maybe this weekend.”
</p>

<p>
“Gee, that sounds great.”
</p>

<p>
Laura had to look at the paper; she <em>had</em> to. It
gnawed at her, as she sat at her desk, sneaking through it
between reports and unable to find anything. Her father’s
name ran through her mind like a robot tune from
a TV commercial.
</p>

<p>
It was a rushed day. Sarah didn’t take a break on days
<a class="pagenum" title="114" id="page-114"></a>
when they were behind, but nothing could have stopped
Laura. She got up and almost ran to the washroom at
eleven, the paper in hand. She felt herself trembling,
going over the pages again and again, until she suddenly
found it at the bottom of page 12. “Chi Delta Sigma, national
journalism fraternity, opens its convention today
at the McAlton Hotel. The convention will last until next
Saturday, at which time ...” etc. There was an agenda
listed, a few names—the national officers. There it was—Merrill
Landon, corresponding secretary. Laura shut her
eyes and groaned a little.
</p>

<p>
The day dragged. She typed until the small round keys
seemed to weigh a pound apiece under her fingers, and
still the reports piled up.
</p>

<p>
Laura sat hunched over her machine for a long time
after the others had left for the day. She meant to work,
but she never did any. She wanted to cry and she couldn’t.
She wanted to move, to talk to someone, to explode, and
she just sat there until the cramps in her back made her
groan. She got up stiffly and put her jacket on and stood
for a moment, aimless and lost. There was nowhere to go,
nothing to do. Marcie wouldn’t be home yet.
</p>

<p>
She rummaged idly in her pockets, pulling out some
change and a shopping list. The list was from the week
before and she started to drop it in the wastebasket, when
she noticed something on the other side. A phone number—Watkins
9-1313. And the initials B. B. Laura crumpled
it in her hand, seized with an uncontrollably pleasant
shudder. Then she threw it indignantly into the wastebasket,
wondering when Beebo had scribbled it out. And
then she leaned over slowly and took it out of the wastebasket
and shoved it furtively back into her pocket, without
looking at it. She sat down abruptly in her chair and
put her head down on her arms and wept.
</p>

<p>
“Father ...” she whispered. “Why did we have to hate
each other? We’re all we have ... Father ...”
</p>

<p>
She got up fifteen minutes later, turned out the lights,
and stole out, quiet as a thief.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She walked over to the McAlton Hotel. She had no
idea what she expected to find or to do. But she went
into the big softly carpeted lobby and walked, almost as
<a class="pagenum" title="115" id="page-115"></a>
if she were sleep walking, toward the desk. It was crowded
and noisy, with that ineffable air of excitement that big
hotels seem to generate.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt gooseflesh start up all over her. Many of
these people must be conventioneers. If Merrill Landon
didn’t see her one of his Chicago friends might, and the
secret would be out. He would run her down if it took the
whole New York City police force.
</p>

<p>
She leaned apprehensively on the marble topped
counter of the desk, waiting until a clerk could serve her.
He came up after a couple of minutes, looking enormously
efficient and busy. “May I help you, Miss?” he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
“Is a Mr. Merrill Landon staying here?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“Just a minute, please.” He disappeared briefly and
Laura looked around the lobby, her hand partially covering
her face.
</p>

<p>
<em>He might see me. I must be out of my mind to come
here.</em> But she waited none-the-less.
</p>

<p>
“He’s in 1402,” the clerk said loudly in her ear.
</p>

<p>
Laura jumped.
</p>

<p>
“Shall I call him?” asked the clerk.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, please.” She had no idea why she was doing this.
She felt as if she were two people, one acting, the other
watching; one compelled to act, the other shocked by the
action.
</p>

<p>
“Who wants to see him, please?”
</p>

<p>
“His daughter.” She almost whispered it, and he made
her repeat it. Then he buzzed off. She watched him, perhaps
ten feet from her but impossible to hear, as he lifted
the receiver, gave the number, waited. Then his face
lighted into a business-type smile, and she saw his lips
form the words, “Mr. Landon?” He went on, and she
watched him, feeling almost sick with anticipation.
</p>

<p>
The clerk came back after a brief conversation. “Well,
Miss—” he began, eyeing her closely.
</p>

<p>
“What did he say?” Laura looked at him with her stark
blue eyes. Her chin trembled.
</p>

<p>
“He says he has no daughter, Miss,” the clerk drawled.
He grinned. “Tough luck. Want to try someone else?”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s mouth dropped open. Her face twitched. She
couldn’t answer him. She turned and ran, bumping into
<a class="pagenum" title="116" id="page-116"></a>
people, stumbling, until she found a phone booth empty
in a row of booths along a far wall and she took refuge
there. She buried her face in her hands and wept. “Merrill
Landon, go to hell, go to hell,” she said fiercely, under
her breath. “I hate you. Oh, God, how I hate you!” And
she sobbed until somebody rapped on the door of the
booth. She wiped her eyes hastily, knowing they were red
and swollen, and turned to glare at the impatient rapper.
He glared back.
</p>

<p>
Defiantly she put a dime in the phone and lifted the
receiver. She called Jack.
</p>

<p>
A voice answered almost at once. A strange masculine
voice. “Hello?” it said.
</p>

<p>
“Jack?” Her voice trembled.
</p>

<p>
“Just a minute.” He called, “Jack, it’s for you.”
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later Jack answered.
</p>

<p>
“Jack, it’s Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you all right?”
</p>

<p>
“I have absolutely nothing to say,” she said. “I’m only
calling because—because I’m in a phone booth and some
fool wants to use the phone. He’s rapping on the door.”
</p>

<p>
“Mother,” he said slowly, “you have a screw loose. Now
listen carefully and do what I tell you. Just go along
quietly and don’t tell them anything. I’ll send my analyst
over right away.”
</p>

<p>
“My father’s in town.” Her breath caught while she
spoke.
</p>

<p>
“Oh! No wonder. Did you tell him to go to hell?”
</p>

<p>
“The desk clerk called his room and said his daughter
wanted to see him.” She stopped to swallow the fury in
her throat.
</p>

<p>
“And he told <em>you</em> to go to hell?”
</p>

<p>
“He said, ‘he had no daughter.’” Her voice trembled
with the immensity of it.
</p>

<p>
Jack, for once, was momentarily speechless. Finally he
said, “He is a bastard, Laura. By God, he is. Don’t mess
with him. Come on over, I’ll buy you a drink.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Jack.” She broke into tears again.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t cry, Laura. Just think what satisfaction that
would give the old s.o.b.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re right!” she said sharply, pulling herself up.
“I won’t. I’ll be right over.”
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Jack was waiting for her on the front stoop, sitting on
one of the cement railings and looking up at what few
stars were available between the roofs. Without a word
he got up, slipped an arm around her, and turned her
away from his apartment. They walked over to a small
bar she hadn’t seen before called Mac’s Alley, without
speaking to each other.
</p>

<p>
The bar was in a basement and you walked down a
flight of twisting stairs to reach it. There were booths
around the walls, tables and a juke box in the middle, and
a long bar ran across the back. Laura walked halfway
towards the bar with Jack before she realized that there
were no other women in the place. She turned to Jack
with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
“Do they want me in here?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
He smiled. “They’re not going to give you a rush,
Mother. I’ll stake my life on it.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t think they liked women in a place like this.”
</p>

<p>
Jack guided her to a barstool. “Oh, they’re friendly
enough. They know you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t
gay. They figure, you leave them alone and they’ll leave
you alone.”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked around her uncomfortably. “I can’t help
thinking I embarrass them.”
</p>

<p>
“Maybe they embarrass you. Would you rather go over
to The Cellar?”
</p>

<p>
“No ... I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t want to run into Beebo. She’s usually out
making the rounds about now. That’s why I brought you
here.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled gratefully at him. “Thanks,” she said. “I
should have seen it myself.” But she found herself so
shaken by the sudden idea of Beebo loose among scores of
desirable girls that she couldn’t concentrate for a minute.
</p>

<p>
Jack ordered them a drink. Then he turned to her,
pushing his glasses back into place on his nose. They
tended to slide down to the halfway mark. “Well?” he
said, and paused. “Let’s tear Papa Landon apart.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to talk about him,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“Then why am I buying you a drink?”
</p>

<p>
She turned to snap at him and then saw he was kidding
her. “Sorry, Jack,” she said. Looking at him brought back
<a class="pagenum" title="118" id="page-118"></a>
her faith in him, and she smiled a little. “I always knew
he was a hard man,” she said softly, “but I never dreamed
he’d go as far as this. I always thought, in spite of everything,
in spite of all the bitterness and misery we’ve had
together, that he must love me a little. After all, I’m all
he has left ... of my mother, my brother ... his family.
I was five when it happened, and I wish to God I could
remember what he was like before. But I can’t. I like to
pretend he was generous and gentle and kind. And I can
remember sitting on his shoulders when we went to a
Fourth of July parade. It was that same summer, before
our vacation. I remember he hoisted me up and bought
me a balloon and held me while the parade went by so I
could see. Afterwards he walked around and talked to his
friends, and he didn’t make me get down. I felt like a
queen on a throne. It’s been my one good memory of him,
to this day. But Mother was with us. Maybe he did it for
her sake.
</p>

<p>
“I remember her better than him from those years.
Sometimes I miss her terribly. She was very loving.”
</p>

<p>
“Maybe,” said Jack, “your father wouldn’t hate you so
now if he hadn’t loved you so much before.”
</p>

<p>
“You give him too much credit,” she said. “After what
he did to me tonight, I’ll never speak to him again. I’d
kill him if I could. But I wouldn’t go near him, even for
that. I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of seeing my
face. He has no daughter, has he? All right, God damn
him, I have no father! Two can play at that game.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t hate me for saying it,” Jack said, “but I think
you still love him. I think you’ll see him again.”
</p>

<p>
She turned on him. “You’re crazy!” she said. “You don’t
know anything! What makes you think such a thing?”
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. “Only that it matters so terribly to you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura finished her drink and placed the glass carefully
on the bar, trying to sort out her thoughts. “If I do see
him again,” she said, “it’ll be when I can tell him I’m a
success. Financially. Socially. Every way. I want to tell
him, ‘I have a good job, nice friends. I can get along fine
in this world without you, and I’ll never need you again.’
And you know what else I’d like to say to him, Jack?”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah.” He lit a cigarette. “‘Father, I’m queer. And
it’s all your fault. Shove that up your rear and live with
<a class="pagenum" title="119" id="page-119"></a>
it!’ Yeah, I know. Shock the hell out of him. I tried that
on—on a close relative once.”
</p>

<p>
“What happened?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t really know. When his face went blue I took
off. I haven’t been home since. I can’t go home to find
out, as a matter of fact. I’m—shall we say—not welcome.”
He said this with slow sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I’m sorry,” she said gently, and looked at him
sympathetically. It occurred to her now, when she found
his own troubles paralleled her own, that he was very
human and not a slick witty party boy without real
feelings. He was lonely. <em>Everybody’s lonely</em>, she thought.
<em>Marcie for a perfect mate. Beebo for a perfect girl.
Jack for an affectionate boy. Me ... Poor Sarah ...</em>
</p>

<p>
That recalled Sarah to her mind. “Jack, I have a
friend,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Congratulations.”
</p>

<p>
“—named Sarah.”
</p>

<p>
“Does Beebo know?”
</p>

<p>
“And she wants a date.”
</p>

<p>
“With a girl?”
</p>

<p>
“—With a boy. She’s straight.”
</p>

<p>
“What a shame.”
</p>

<p>
“Can you help me out?”
</p>

<p>
“I can help <em>you</em>, Mother, but can I help Sarah?”
</p>

<p>
“You must know somebody. How about that boy who
answered your phone tonight? Could he take her out?”
</p>

<p>
“If he does I’ll break his head for him,” he said and
laughed softly, knocking his cigarette ashes into a
scorched aluminum tray in front of him.
</p>

<p>
“Who is he, Jack?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“A friend. No, a lover. For the moment, anyway.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hand on his arm. “Don’t be so cynical,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“These things never last.” He shook his head. “Better
to face it at the beginning.”
</p>

<p>
“He must see something worthy in you or he never
would have come to you in the first place.” She spoke
awkwardly, but with sympathy.
</p>

<p>
“He sees dollar bills.” Jack smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Jack! Don’t be so hard on yourself. It hurts me.” She
didn’t like to see him stick the pins in himself. It
<a class="pagenum" title="120" id="page-120"></a>
was all right when he did it to her, because it was in
fun. She didn’t mind, she understood his need. But
when he hurt himself he hurt in dead earnest.
</p>

<p>
“Besides, you aren’t rich,” Laura said. “If that’s all
he wanted, he’d find somebody else.”
</p>

<p>
“I have a little put away,” he said. “I save it up in
between affairs. When somebody irresistible comes
along, I spend it like a fool. Makes a wonderful impression
the first couple of weeks. Then I’m flat broke and
all alone again. My chronic condition.”
</p>

<p>
It was a pathetic revelation. Laura was taken aback
by it. “You shouldn’t do it, Jack,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t help it. I’ll hang on to him with anything.
Anything I’ve got. Even dollar bills.”
</p>

<p>
“If all he wants is your money he’s not <em>worth</em> your
money! Or your time, or your friendship.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura, this isn’t friendship. This is another subject
entirely. Honest to God.” Laura blushed. “A man
can’t buy a friend. But there’s always a little love for
sale.”
</p>

<p>
“Not real love.”
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. “I don’t ask for the moon.”
</p>

<p>
Laura finished her drink. “What’s his name?” she
said.
</p>

<p>
“Terry.”
</p>

<p>
“Terry what?”
</p>

<p>
“Just Terry.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t trust me.” She said it quietly, but she
was hurt.
</p>

<p>
“Terry Fleming.” He spoke the name gently and
Laura saw a look on his face that changed him entirely.
She studied him, surprised.
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I think you’re in love.” Once said, it
sounded gauche and unfair.
</p>

<p>
But he only said, “I think so, too.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was lost. What do you do on the spot like this?
“I don’t know whether to give you my congratulations
or my sympathy,” she said seriously.
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed. “Both, Mother. That’s a beautiful sentiment,
whatever it is. Thanks.”
</p>

<p>
He seemed unable to talk about it and Laura finally
returned to Sarah. “Is there somebody in the office you
<a class="pagenum" title="121" id="page-121"></a>
could get for Sarah?” she asked. She described her to
him. “She’s not pretty, but she’s just a swell girl.”
</p>

<p>
“I know, there are a million of ’em,” he sighed. “I
wish to God I were straight. I’d marry her, poor kid.”
Laura stared at him, then smiled. “I guess I can arrange
something,” he said. “Do we have to double with
them?”
</p>

<p>
“She expects it. I hate to ask.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, okay. It won’t kill me. But dinner only. And
I’ll be in a hurry.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“I’d better find a tame one for her,” he mused and
then laughed a little. “Whatever that means. Jesus, the
poor girl has probably dreamed all her life of a good
thorough raping. But I can’t assume the responsibility.
Maybe Jensen can go. I’ll call you in the morning
on it.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks. She’d be so happy.” Laura finished a second
drink. Jack was two up on her. She looked at him
out of the corner of her eye, wanting to tell him about
the change that had come over Marcie but afraid of his
sarcasm. Finally she said, in the characteristic blunt
way that disguised her uncertainty, “Jack, Marcie is
different. Something’s happening to her. I—I’m
scared.” She could go no further. She looked away from
him.
</p>

<p>
Jack chuckled. “Well, what’s she doing, filching undies
from Macy’s basement?”
</p>

<p>
“She doesn’t want to see Burr any more.”
</p>

<p>
Jack frowned slightly. “She’s finally coming to her
senses? That was a screwy match to begin with. Burr
wants to worship one gal. Marcie wants to raise a little
hell with every other man she sees.”
</p>

<p>
“She wants to be like me. That’s what she said. She
wants to read books. Spend more time at home. She
wants me to help her.”
</p>

<p>
“Help her what?”
</p>

<p>
Laura frowned. “I don’t know what. She says she’s sick
of herself and she wants to be a better person.”
</p>

<p>
Jack bit his underlip reflectively. “I know what
you’re thinking. And you’re wrong. She’s not turning
gay.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="122" id="page-122"></a>
“I didn’t say that.” Laura turned to him indignantly.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to. You’re thinking it so hard I can
hear the wheels going around in your head.” He looked
at her. “Once and for all, Laura, she’s <em>not gay</em>. Maybe
she’s got room in her somewhere for a little curiosity.
Maybe living with you really has made her dissatisfied
with herself. If so, so much the better. But she’s
not mooning for you every night.”
</p>

<p>
“She acted so funny, Jack. Like—like she enjoyed having
me near her. Like she wanted me to touch her. I
mean, comfort her. You know.”
</p>

<p>
“The more you want her to enjoy it, the more it’ll
seem like she does.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not making up stories,” Laura said with some
heat.
</p>

<p>
“No, Mother, I know. I believe you. I’m just telling
you a fact. I’ve known Marcie for a couple of years.
From the time she and Burr started dating right
through their divorce. She’s capable of—let’s say—wondering.
Like the night she wanted to touch tongues.”
Laura shivered involuntarily. “Once in a while she
gets a kick out of a fling in the Village. Maybe she
just wants to see how far you’ll go. Maybe she’s egging
you on, Laura. Did you ever think of that? Just to see
what the hell you’ll do?”
</p>

<p>
“She wouldn’t do that,” Laura said positively, somewhat
shocked. “Never.”
</p>

<p>
Jack gave a little snort. “Okay, maybe not. But she’s
not about to fall for you. Not now or ever.”
</p>

<p>
“She meant it when she talked to me last night. She
was sincere.”
</p>

<p>
“Sure she meant it. She’s on a book kick. She’s obviously
very impressed with you. It shows when she
talks about you. Temporarily, you’re somebody to imitate,
somebody to admire.”
</p>

<p>
“Temporarily?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t fall into a trap.” He put a hand on her knee.
</p>

<p>
“It’s no trap! She’s too innocent to set me a trap.”
</p>

<p>
“Innocent?” He laughed. “Don’t count on it. Besides,
you’re too innocent to avoid one. Right now you have
a lot to learn.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="123" id="page-123"></a>
Laura glared at him. “I’m not stupid.”
</p>

<p>
“No, you’re not. You’re very bright, honey. You’re just
uninformed. If you want to learn, go scout up Beebo and
take the Grand Tour of the Village.”
</p>

<p>
“I could no more fall for her than I could fall for—for—”
</p>

<p>
“For me?” He laughed.
</p>

<p>
She smiled suddenly and laughed with him. “Oh,”
she said with a wave of her hand, “You’re taken.”
</p>

<p>
“Mother, that’s a beautiful one-line definition of
my dilemma. My analyst could use you.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you being analyzed?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“Aren’t we all?”
</p>

<p>
“Answer me!”
</p>

<p>
“I did. Let’s go. I hate to keep people waiting.”
</p>

<p>
“Who’s waiting?”
</p>

<p>
“My friend, Mr. Fleming.”
</p>

<p>
She slipped off the barstool, pulling her jacket on.
“I’d like to meet him.”
</p>

<p>
“If it lasts another couple of weeks, I guess it’d be
safe.” He took her arm and steered her through the crowd.
They stared at her but it didn’t disconcert her so much
now that she had had a drink or two.
</p>

<p>
“Where’s your adoring roommate tonight?” Jack said as
they went up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
“Having dinner downtown.”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you go over to The Cellar? Let Beebo tell
you some fairy stories. She’s got a million of ’em.”
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t take Beebo tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Suit yourself. I’ll walk you to the subway.”
</p>

<p>
“No, don’t bother. I know you want to get home.
Thanks a lot, Jack. I don’t know why you’re so good to
me.”
</p>

<p>
“My interest is purely academic. Your innocence
amazes me.”
</p>

<p>
“You make me feel like a hayseed,” she said.
</p>

<p>
He laughed. “Okay, Hayseed. I’ll call you in the morning
on what’s-her-name.”
</p>

<p>
“Sarah.”
</p>

<p>
“Sarah. See you.” And he turned and walked off.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura walked toward the subway but she knew she
wasn’t going home. She knew she would walk right past
<a class="pagenum" title="124" id="page-124"></a>
it and she did. She walked for four blocks, seething
with a renewed fury at Merrill Landon. Her hot hand
was cramped around the slip of paper with Beebo’s
number on it, in the pocket of her jacket....
</p>

<p>
<em>I’ll pay her back. I’ll just give her the money I owe
her, have one drink, and go home.</em> She looked at her
watch—a little past nine. For a moment she stood at
the head of the stairs looking down at the double doors
that opened into The Cellar, feeling her heart bound
nervously. She never seemed able to walk into this place
confidently. There was always a moment of fear and reluctance.
But the need to be with her own kind quickly
overpowered it.
</p>

<p>
She walked in, heading for the bar, ignoring the
curious stares that greeted her. She stood at the end of the
bar and when the bartender came up he recognized her.
</p>

<p>
“Hi,” he said. “What’ll it be?”
</p>

<p>
“Whisky and water, please,” she said. She looked
around the place, up and down the bar, around the
tables, but she didn’t see Beebo. She drank half her drink,
and then walked back to the ladies’ room, looking into
the rear of The Cellar, but Beebo wasn’t there. In extreme
irritation she walked back to the bar, wondering
whether to crush her pride and ask the bartender where
Beebo was, or let it go. She finished her drink and decided
if she had come this far she might as well go
the whole way.
</p>

<p>
“Where’s Beebo tonight?” she asked the bartender the
next time he got near. “I owe her some money,” she explained
compulsively. He smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, she’s been and gone already,” he said. “She’s
probably over at The Colophon. She likes it over there.
No boys.” He grinned.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks,” said Laura, slipping off her seat at the
bar and heading for the door. She was embarrassed
enough without asking him where The Colophon was.
She didn’t want to advertise her “innocence.”
</p>

<p>
Near the door a slim pretty girl, who had kept an eye
on her at the bar, approached her. The girl wore her
hair in a short soft curly cut. She was blonde and feminine.
Laura let herself be approached simply by returning
the girl’s gaze as she came near her. She stopped
when the girl spoke.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="125" id="page-125"></a>
“Excuse me,” the girl said. “We noticed you were
all alone. My friends and me. Like to have a drink
with us?” She nodded toward a table where three other
girls were sitting, watching them. One of them, sitting
alone on one side of the table, stared coldly at
Laura.
</p>

<p>
Laura was flattered. But the feelings in her were too
personal, too rough, to dissipate with strangers.
“Thanks,” she said. “I’d like to, but I’m looking for
somebody. I’m in a hurry.”
</p>

<p>
“Who’re you looking for? Maybe we can help you
out,” said the girl, stopping Laura as she started to
move away.
</p>

<p>
Laura realized the girl was interested in her, and
it made her turn back once more. “Oh,” she said with
a little shrug, “you wouldn’t know her.”
</p>

<p>
“Somebody might. We’re over here a lot. What’s her
name?”
</p>

<p>
Laura was dead certain they’d know Beebo, who came
over here all the time. The last thing she wanted was
to have everybody run up and tell Beebo that Laura had
been looking for her. The bartender would no doubt tell
her. That was bad enough.
</p>

<p>
“What’s her name?” the girl prompted, and then
smiled. “Don’t want to tell?”
</p>

<p>
Laura blushed and backed away from her. “I just owe
her some money. I thought she’d be down here tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Who?” the girl goaded her, with a pretty smile.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo Brinker.” Laura didn’t mean to say it. Yet
saying it was better than trying to hide it and getting
laughed at. They could always ask the bartender
who she was looking for after she left, and she would
look even worse. They would take her stammering reluctance
for infatuation. She said the name as casually
as she could.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Beebo!” The girl laughed. “She left half an hour
ago. She’s over at the Colophon. She said this place
was dead tonight. I guess if she’d known you were coming
she would have waited—hm?” She smiled.
</p>

<p>
“I guess,” said Laura briefly. She stared at the girl.
It occurred to her that she saw a slight resemblance to
Beth in her face. Then she turned and walked out.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="126" id="page-126"></a>
The slim girl walked back to her table. Her partner
said peevishly, “Maybe that’ll teach you you’re not irresistible.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, shut up,” the slim girl said quietly. “She’s
Beebo Brinker’s girl.”
</p>

<p>
“Beebo’s girl, hell. Beebo’s got a dozen girls. She can
really pick ’em though, I’ll say that much. I should get
one like that.” And she made a face at the slim one by
her side.

Chapter Eleven

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">L</span><span class="postfirstchar">aura</span> went home. She arrived before ten, but Marcie
wasn’t back yet. Laura put a book she had been reading
on Marcie’s bed and climbed into her own bed. She
tried to read herself, but she couldn’t. An hour went
by, and no Marcie. Nervously, Laura shut her book and
dropped it to the floor. She got up and went into the
bathroom to brush her teeth, and remembered she had
already done it.
</p>

<p>
Then she went to the phone. She didn’t know what
was coming over her. She only felt a deep will-defying
unhappiness. She pulled out the phone book and looked
up the number of the McAlton Hotel. She sat for a moment
with the book open in her lap, unable to move. Then
she reached slowly for the phone.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly it rang. Laura screamed, a small quick cry
of extreme surprise. Her heart had taken a tremendous
leap at the piercing bell sound in that still apartment.
She let it ring twice more while she caught her breath.
<em>It must be Marcie</em>, she thought. <em>Maybe she’s in trouble.</em>
She lifted the receiver. “Hello?”
</p>

<p>
“Hello, Bo-peep.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s heart gave another bound. She felt the sweat
break out. “Beebo?” she said faintly.
</p>

<p>
“How are you, sweetheart? I hear you were looking for
me tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“You didn’t waste any time.” Her voice was sharp.
</p>

<p>
“I hate to keep a lady waiting. What’s on your
mind?”
</p>

<p>
“I just dropped in for a drink. I was down there in
the Village to see Jack and I just wanted to pay you
back.” She spoke in fits and starts.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t owe me a thing, Bo-peep. Not a thing.”
</p>

<p>
“A drink.” Laura hated to owe anybody anything.
She was meticulous about her debts, however small the
sum.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="128" id="page-128"></a>
“You’re right.” Laura could feel her smile. “I nearly
forgot. Okay lover, you owe me one drink.”
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, I can’t talk now, really.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re doing fine. What’s the matter, Marcie
breathing down your neck?”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not that.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to say you love me, you know. Just
say you’ll meet me tomorrow night. About eight.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be late, doll. I’ll call Marcie and ask her where
the hell you are.”
</p>

<p>
“You wouldn’t! You won’t! Damn you, Beebo!”
</p>

<p>
“I would and I will.” She laughed. “Eight on the
dot.”
</p>

<p>
“I won’t be there.”
</p>

<p>
“Want to bet?”
</p>

<p>
Laura hung up on her. She was trembling. Angrily
she slammed the heavy phone back into place, switched
out the bedroom light, and got into bed.
</p>

<p>
The black night settled around her but it brought
more restless tossing than repose. The hours slipped by.
No Marcie. No sleep. Only an endless bitter reviewing
of what her father had done to her; the look on the clerk’s
face when he gave her the message; the impotent fury
and shame that besieged her. At last she turned the light
back on and began to pace the room. The electric clock
on Marcie’s dresser said two-thirty. Laura wondered
whether to call Burr. Or Jack. She was getting afraid
for Marcie. But nobody knew how to reach her. There
was nothing to do but wait.
</p>

<p>
It was a few minutes past three when Marcie came
in. Laura had left the living room light on for her
and she heard her come in laughing and heard a male
voice answer her. Not Burr’s voice. Somebody else. A
deep mature voice. Laura peeked out through the crack
in the kitchen door but couldn’t see him. Marcie was
giggling, as if she were tight, and pushing him away.
Laura could see her now and then.
</p>

<p>
Marcie said, “I’ll call my roommate. She’ll make you
go home.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t go home tonight. I live in Chicago.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s where she’s from!”
</p>

<p>
“Who?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="129" id="page-129"></a>
“My roommate.”
</p>

<p>
“To hell with her. Come here, Baby.”
</p>

<p>
“No!” High as she was, she nevertheless sounded a
little scared. She had stopped laughing.
</p>

<p>
Laura threw a coat hastily over her pajamas and went
into the living room. A large man, partly bald and handsome
in a heavy featured way, had Marcie wrapped in
a bear hug and was trying to drag her to the couch.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” said Laura sharply. “Get out.”
</p>

<p>
She startled them both so much that they froze where
they were. The man stared at her. He was drunk, and his
balance wasn’t the best. Laura, pale and silver blond, her
long hair falling down her shoulders, her face strange
and sensitive and imperious, looked like an apparition
to him. Without taking his eyes off her he
asked Marcie, “Who the hell is <em>that</em>?”
</p>

<p>
“My roommate.” Marcie took advantage of his interest
to slip free. Laura took her arm firmly and sent
her through the kitchen door. Then she turned back to
the man.
</p>

<p>
“All right, you,” she said as if he were a servant.
“Out.”
</p>

<p>
The impudence of it amused him and angered him
at the same time. “You can’t talk to me like that,” he
said.
</p>

<p>
She advanced on him briskly, pulling the door open
sharply and facing him. “It’s my home and I’ll speak
as I please,” she said. She looked as cold and unapproachable
as she was hot and angry. He stared at her,
not sure how to take her, and then came toward her to
put a hand on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie’s no good,” he said confidentially. “Let’s
you and me—”
</p>

<p>
Laura swept his hand off her shoulder. “Get out of
here or I’ll call the police,” she said.
</p>

<p>
He got mad. “Jesus, what a chilly little bitch you
are!” he growled.
</p>

<p>
“Get out,” Laura said, so cold, so controlled, that she
froze him into submission. She shut the door after
him, resisting the urge to slam it. <em>Dear God</em>, she
thought intensely. <em>If I could do that to my father. Just
once.</em>
</p>

<p>
“Laura? It was just a party, Laur,” Marcie said. “We
<a class="pagenum" title="130" id="page-130"></a>
went out after dinner. Just for kicks. He got sort of out
of hand. Thanks, Laur, I don’t know what I’d have done.”
</p>

<p>
“Come on to bed.” Laura turned and walked toward
her and Marcie preceded her into the bedroom. It occurred
to her then that she was behaving with Marcie
much as Beth used to behave with her. She was asserting
herself, taking the lead. She liked it; with Marcie,
anyway. She felt her influence and reveled in it. A
feeling of tremendous strength swept through her when
the man turned and left, like the other poor demented
little fellow who pestered her on the subway. Only he
was such a weakling he hardly counted. She had a mental
image of herself treating Merrill Landon that way, and
it worked a strange exaltation in her. She smiled.
</p>

<p>
Marcie grinned at her crookedly. “I thought you’d
be sore,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No. No, of course not. Why should I be?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know. Maybe because I felt kind of guilty
going out with somebody besides Burr. But I had fun.
Up to the end, anyway. I wouldn’t have minded that if
he hadn’t slobbered so much.” She giggled and Laura
ignored what she said. They were standing less than a
foot from each other and suddenly Laura reached for her
and gave her a little hug. “I’m not mad. I’m just glad
you’re all right,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Marcie submitted, but she seemed embarrassed, and
Laura quickly released her. With the release came a
letdown, a loss of strength and confidence. She slipped
quietly into bed and spent the hours till dawn wrestling
with the bedclothes.
</p>

<p class="tb">

</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura didn’t feel much brighter than Marcie in the
morning. She got to work on time, but all she wanted to
do was sleep. <em>I’ve got to catch up. I’ve got to catch up</em>,
she kept telling herself. <em>Less than three weeks and Jean’ll
be back. And I haven’t done a really good day’s work
since she left. Even if they like me, they can’t keep me
on as a charity case.</em>
</p>

<p>
The episode at the McAlton flamed up in her mind
and gave her an angry energy through most of the morning.
Sarah said nothing to her, but she kept looking
at her over her typewriter, apparently afraid to bring
<a class="pagenum" title="131" id="page-131"></a>
up the date subject again. It wasn’t till Jack called that
Laura even remembered it.
</p>

<p>
“All set,” he said. “Carl Jensen can go. Friday night.
Dinner and a show. What’s Sarah’s number?”
</p>

<p>
Laura got it from her and made her face light up
with expectation. Jack put Carl on the phone, and
Laura gave her end to Sarah. It gave her a momentary
lift to see somebody else stammering with pleasure
and anticipation. But the day she lived through was
endless, bleak with undone work, dragging will, impotent
anger.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
“You’re late,” Marcie said when Laura walked in. “I
wanted you to tell me about that book Burr brought over
last week.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing to tell.” Laura felt too low to talk, to joke,
even to eat. She picked listlessly at her food. After a while
Marcie fell silent, too.
</p>

<p>
When the dishes were done Marcie said, “I called Burr.
Broke our date tonight.” She looked expectantly at Laura,
as if this were a significant revelation, and she wanted a
proper reaction.
</p>

<p>
But Laura only said, “Oh?” and walked into the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Marcie followed her. “What’s the matter, Laur?” she
said. And when Laura didn’t answer, she asked, “Bad
day?”
</p>

<p>
“Um-hm. Bad day.” Laura lay down on her bed, face
downward, one leg hanging over the edge, her mind
wholly occupied with her father: her hatred, her stifled
love for him, her fear of him.
</p>

<p>
“Talk to me, Laura,” Marcie said, coming over to sit
next to her.
</p>

<p>
“Not tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Please. You said you would.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t, Marcie. I can’t talk. I’m too tired.” She rolled
over and looked at her. “Don’t look like that,” she said.
“I’m—I’m worried about my job, that’s all. I’ll be all
right.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s wrong with your job?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Laura! God! Make sense!” Marcie exclaimed.
<a class="pagenum" title="132" id="page-132"></a>
But when she evoked no response she dropped it with a
sigh. “Let’s go out on the roof,” she said, “and get some
fresh air. It’s a beautiful night.”
</p>

<p>
“Looks like rain.”
</p>

<p>
“How would you know? You’re staring at the ceiling.”
</p>

<p>
“It did, earlier.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what’s beautiful about it. Maybe there’ll be
thunder. I love to stand naked in the rain.” She
glanced down slowly at Laura.
</p>

<p>
But Laura turned back on her stomach without a word.
A terrible apathy nailed her to the bed. Not even the
nearness of Marcie could arouse her. They sat quietly for
a few minutes, Laura lost in herself, and Marcie searching
for a way to cheer her up. The phone rang.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll get it,” Marcie said, and got up. She walked across
the room and picked up the receiver when Laura suddenly
remembered Beebo. She sat up in a rush.
</p>

<p>
“No,” Marcie was saying, “I can’t. I’m sorry. I don’t
want to argue, not any more. I’ve had enough, that’s all.
I won’t talk to you, Burr. No, it’s not her fault, it’s nobody’s
fault.” She looked at Laura stretched out again
on her bed. “That has nothing to do with it. No. Goodnight,
Burr.”
</p>

<p>
She hung up and stood for a moment motionless, watching
Laura, who lay with her face turned away, apparently
relaxed. Burr was getting jealous, impatient. He was
ready to accuse anybody of anything to get Marcie’s favor
back. Their phone conversations were little more than arguments
which Marcie terminated by hanging up on him.
But he wouldn’t be put off for long.
</p>

<p>
Marcie sat down on her own bed with a book, the one
she meant to ask Laura about. She stared at the pages
without reading, and wondered about her moody roommate.
</p>

<p>
Laura was watching her wristwatch. It was two minutes
fast. She lay still, but she was alert, poised to jump. At
two minutes past eight, by her watch, the phone rang
again. “It’s for me,” she told Marcie, who had no intention
of going for it. Laura came across the room and sat
on Marcie’s bed.
</p>

<p>
“Hello?” she said into the receiver.
</p>

<p>
“Hi, lover. Where are you?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="133" id="page-133"></a>
“At home,” Laura said sarcastically. “Where else?”
</p>

<p>
“You want me to come over?”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll be down in a few minutes. I was delayed.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, but make it fast. I’ll call again at eight-thirty.
And every ten minutes after that.”
</p>

<p>
Laura hung up without a further word and turned to
look at Marcie. “I met him at work,” she said, her face
flushing. “He’s been pestering me. I don’t want to see
him.” She didn’t know what she was going to do.
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” said Marcie. <em>Then why all the fuss?</em> She looked
curiously at Laura’s pink face. Laura turned away and
began to walk up and down the room, feeling as if there
were a bomb sealed in her breast, ticking, about to go off.
She knew her nails were cutting her underarms, yet she
hardly felt them. It was an expression of terrible tension
in her. Suddenly she whipped the closet door open and
pulled out her coat.
</p>

<p>
Marcie, watching her, said quickly, “Where’re you
going?”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll be back early,” Laura said, heading for the door,
propelled by the tight violence that was boiling inside her.
</p>

<p>
“Laura!” Marcie jumped up and followed her. “Damn
it, Laur, please tell me, I’m worried about you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned abruptly at the door. “I’m just going out
for a little while,” she said. “I won’t be late.” She tried to
leave, but Marcie grabbed her arms.
</p>

<p>
“You’re not fit to go anywhere, Laura. I never saw
you so upset,” Marcie said. “Except once. And you—you
spent the night with Jack that time. It was my fault. Is
this my fault? Am I driving you out again?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, nothing’s your fault.” Laura covered her face
with her hand for a minute and when Marcie’s arms went
around her to comfort her, she wept. “Please don’t let me
go,” she whispered. “I mean—God!—I mean, let me go.
Let me go, Marcie.” She began to resist.
</p>

<p>
But the curiosity in Marcie had taken over. “You’re
trembling all over. Come to bed, Laur. Come on, honey,
you’re in no shape to go anywhere. Come tell me about
it,” she coaxed, trying to guide Laura away from the door.
But Laura knew what was in store for her if she obeyed.
She uncovered her face to gaze for a moment at Marcie,
so close to her, so tantalizing. And that terrible storm
<a class="pagenum" title="134" id="page-134"></a>
brewing inside her made her feel as if she might do any
wild thing that her body demanded of her. She was afraid.
</p>

<p>
“Please,” Marcie said softly. “I’ll give you a rubdown,
I’m a great masseuse. My father taught me how.” She
smiled. “Please, Laur.”
</p>

<p>
“Your father?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you love him very much?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” Marcie frowned at her.
</p>

<p>
“And he loves you?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re lucky, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s the way it’s supposed to be, Laur. I’m not
lucky. I’m just normal. Ordinary, I mean.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at her. The emotion in her simmered dangerously
near the top. With a sudden swift movement,
Laura kissed Marcie’s cheek lightly, leaving the wet of her
tears on Marcie’s face, and then whispered, “So lucky ...
so lucky ...” Then she turned and ran down the stairs
to the elevator.
</p>

<p>
Marcie sat down on a living room chair and put her
head in her hands and tried to think. Laura’s strange behaviour
made her tickle inside. She felt close to the storm
that had barely brushed past her, and yet she remained
untouched. There was only the wet on her cheek as a
token, and she brushed it off, inexplicably embarrassed.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura made the taxi driver take her past the McAlton.
She counted to the fourteenth floor, as nearly as she could
figure it, and stared at the golden blocks of windows,
and wondered which ones opened into 1402. And if Merrill
Landon was in his room.
</p>

<p>
She walked in quickly when she reached The Cellar,
with no hesitation, and made for the bar. It was a little
past eight-thirty by her watch. She hoped anxiously that
Beebo hadn’t called Marcie again. She saw her at the far
end of the bar talking to two very pretty young girls.
They looked like teenagers. Laura was dismayed at the
flash of jealousy that went through her. She walked right
up to Beebo, without being seen, until she stood next to
her. She took a seat beside her, watching Beebo while she
talked, until one of the teens nudged her and nodded
<a class="pagenum" title="135" id="page-135"></a>
curiously at Laura. Beebo turned and broke into a smile.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Bo-peep,” she said. “Didn’t hear you come in.
How are you?”
</p>

<p>
“Am I interrupting something?” Laura looked away.
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed. “Not a thing. This is Josie. And this is
Bella. Laura.” She leaned back on her stool so they could
all see each other.
</p>

<p>
The younger girls made effusive greetings, the better to
exhibit luscious smiles, but Laura only said, “Hello,” to
them briefly. Beebo laughed again, and leaned closer to
her.
</p>

<p>
“Jealous, baby?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“I owe you one drink,” Laura snapped. “What do you
want?”
</p>

<p>
“Whisky and water.”
</p>

<p>
Laura nodded at the bartender.
</p>

<p>
“Is that all you came for, Bo-peep?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t talk like that, Beebo, you make me sick.” Laura
still wouldn’t look at her.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t last time.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes you did. I hope you’ve bought your friends there
one of Dutton’s cartoons. It’s the quickest way to get rid
of them I know.”
</p>

<p>
“Why didn’t it work with you?” Beebo laughed softly
in Laura’s ear. “You came home with me that night, if
you recall.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned angrily away from her. “What happened
was in spite of the God damn juvenile cartoon, not because
of it. I nearly walked out when he gave it to me.”
</p>

<p>
“But you didn’t.”
</p>

<p>
“I should have.”
</p>

<p>
The bartender came up and Laura started to order. She
wanted to buy Beebo the drink and have one quick one
herself, and then get out. Go home. Forget she had come.
But before she could give an order, Beebo said, “Come
home with me, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Come on.” Beebo spun her slowly around on the barstool
with one arm. Laura looked reluctantly at her for the
first time since she had been noticed. Beebo smiled down
at her, her short black hair and wide brow making her face
more boyish even than Laura remembered. She was remarkably
<a class="pagenum" title="136" id="page-136"></a>
handsome. Laura was deeply ashamed of what
she was feeling, sitting there on the barstool, letting herself
be influenced by this girl she tried so hard to despise.
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you invite Bella?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“She’s busy.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s cheeks went hot with fury, and she shook Beebo’s
arm off and started to get up, to walk past her, to
get out. But Beebo caught her, laughing deep in her
throat, thoroughly amused. “By Jesus, you <em>are</em> jealous!”
she said. “Sorry, baby, I had to know. Come on, let’s go.”
</p>

<p>
Laura, who was pulling against her, suddenly found
herself going in the same direction as Beebo, heading for
the door, all her resistance dissipated.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, I didn’t come here for that! I came to keep you
from calling Marcie. To pay you back that drink.”
</p>

<p>
“I want you to owe me that drink all the rest of your
life, Bo-peep.”
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped. Then she walked hurriedly ahead of
Beebo, trying to get far enough ahead to escape. In the
faces around the tables she spotted the slim little blonde
who had approached her before about Beebo. She was
laughing and the sudden humiliation that filled Laura
sent her running up the steps to the street. But Beebo was
close behind her, and Laura felt her arms come around her
from behind, and Beebo’s lips on her neck, and her own
knees going shaky.
</p>

<p>
“No, no, oh Beebo, please! Not here, not here
<em>please</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura, darling.” Beebo kissed her again. “Not here
is right. Come on.” She put an arm around her and led
her away as she had before, and suddenly, strangely, Laura
felt like running. She felt like running with all her strength
until they reached Beebo’s apartment. For there was no
doubt about it any longer, that was where they were going.
</p>

<p>
She wanted her arms around Beebo, their hot bare
bodies pressed together as before. Almost without realizing
it she began to speed up and then to run. Instantly
Beebo was after her, then beside her, laughing that pagan
laugh of hers. She caught a handful of Laura’s streaming
hair, silver in the street light, and pulled her to a stop,
whirling her around. In almost the same gesture she swept
her into a dark doorway and kissed her, still laughing.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="137" id="page-137"></a>
“You’re wonderful,” she said in a rough whisper.
“You’re nuts. I love you.”
</p>

<p>
“No no no no no,” Laura moaned, but she returned
Beebo’s kisses passionately. It was Beebo who had to quit
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, God, Laura, stop. Stop!” she said. “We can’t come
in the streets. Come on, baby.” She dragged her on for
another two blocks. Laura walked <a id="corr-18"></a>as if she were drunk. She
had no liquor in her, but she was not sober. Not at all.
She felt punchy. She half ran, half skipped, to keep up
with Beebo’s stride. For the last two blocks they ran as
fast as they could go. Beebo led her into Cordelia Street,
and through the green door into the court.
</p>

<p>
Inside the door, standing in the little court, the urgency
left Laura. She stood gasping for breath, leaning against
the brick wall by the door. She was where she wanted to
be, next to a fascinating woman whom she wanted to
make love to. It was a huge physical need, an emotional
hypnotism, that drew her to Beebo. After the wild race
she had just come through Laura wanted suddenly to
slow down. To tease, to tantalize. She felt like somebody
entirely different. Not the tightly controlled Laura who
lived anxiously with Marcie, with an uncertain job, with
the spectre of a hated father. Not the nerve-tortured
cautious girl her roommate knew, but a warm excited
woman on the verge of the ultimate intimacy. She wanted
it, she asked for it, she accepted it. She stood watching
Beebo, her eyes enormous with it, her nostrils flared, her
lips parted. Beebo came toward her, smiling, but Laura
slipped away.
</p>

<p>
She moved, almost glided, to a circle of benches in the
center of the court. Beebo followed her. And again when
she reached for her, Laura slipped around the benches.
Beebo reached again, and Laura faded out of her grasp.
And suddenly Beebo was on fire.
</p>

<p>
“Come here, come here, baby. Pretty baby. Pretty
Laura,” she chanted like a spell. But Laura eluded her,
moving just a little faster each time, until they were running
again, and Laura felt the laughter coming out of
her, soft and light at first, but growing wilder, uncontrollable.
She fled, inches from Beebo’s hands, into the
dark hallway, and scrambled up the stairs, losing her
<a class="pagenum" title="138" id="page-138"></a>
footing, and nearly losing her freedom, twice. Beebo was
so close behind her near the top that she could hear her
breath. With a little shriek of unbearable excitement,
she fell against Beebo’s door, and felt within a second
Beebo’s weight come hard against her. The laughter burst
out of her again until Beebo got the door open and they
almost fell into the living room.
</p>

<p>
Nix was all over them instantly, but Beebo, dragging
Laura by the neck and Nix by his collar, locked him in
the bathroom. Then she turned on Laura. Laura, seeing
her, suddenly stopped laughing. Beebo looked unearthly.
Her black hair was tumbled, her cheeks were crimson,
her chest heaved. But it was her eyes that almost frightened
Laura.
</p>

<p>
Laura let her jacket drop from her shoulders slowly,
provocatively, and Beebo approached her. They stood
motionless, so close that just the tips of Laura’s breasts
touched Beebo, and they stood that way, without moving,
until Laura shut her eyes, letting her head rock back on
her shoulders, and groaned.
</p>

<p>
“Do it, Beebo,” she said. “Do it. I can’t stand it, do it
to me.”
</p>

<p>
“Beg me. Beg me, baby.”
</p>

<p>
Laura’s eyes opened. She didn’t know how hard her
breath was coming, how strange and wonderful she
looked with all her inhibitions burning up in her own
flame of desire. “Beebo, Beebo, take me,” she groaned.
</p>

<p>
Still Beebo didn’t move. Her breath was hot and pure
on Laura’s face when she spoke. “When I start, Laura,”
she said slowly, “I’m never going to stop.” She put her
hands against the wall over Laura’s head and leaned on
them, her eyes boring into Laura’s, her body closing
gently in on Laura’s, pressing. “Never,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Do it, Beebo. God! Do it!”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll never stop. Never.” Her lips grazed Laura’s brow.
</p>

<p>
Laura shook all over. She couldn’t talk, except to repeat
Beebo’s name over and over and over, as if she were in a
trance. Beebo’s hands came slowly over her hair, her face,
her breasts, her waist, her hips. And then one strong arm
went around her and Laura groaned. They sank to the
floor, wracked with passion, kissing each other ravenously,
tearing at each other’s clothes.
</p>

<p class="tb">
<a class="pagenum" title="139" id="page-139"></a>

</p>

<p class="noindent">
They never heard Nix’s indignant barking from the
bathroom, or the phone when it rang a half hour later.
They never felt the chill of the rainy night nor the hard
discomfort of the floor where they lay. Or the phone when
it rang again. And later, yet again. It was not until
late morning and brilliant sunshine invaded the room that
they were aware of anything but themselves.
</p>

<p>
Once again it was Laura who woke up first. She was too
bewildered to think straight at first, and the sight of
Beebo, turning over slowly and opening her eyes, did nothing
to straighten her out. Physically she felt wonderful.
For a few moments she luxuriated in her body, letting her
mind go blank.
</p>

<p>
She rubbed her hands gently over herself and discovered
a bruise on her thigh. The little ache gave her a
sudden hard thrill and she remembered how Beebo made
the bruise with her mouth. She had to fight hard against
the need to roll over on Beebo and start loving her all
over again. She touched the small bruise once more and
felt the same shameless pleasure. She stretched, more for
Beebo’s benefit than her own.
</p>

<p>
Beebo caught her and pulled her down and rubbed her
black hair against Laura’s breasts. Laura laughed and
struggled with her.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, I’ve got to get up. I have to get to work.”
</p>

<p>
“To hell with work. This is love.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t keep me, Beebo. This job means the world to
me. I don’t want to be late.” She spoke the truth, yet
she had no idea of how she was going to get up and get
out.
</p>

<p>
“What time do you think it is, baby?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo peered over her head at the dresser clock.
“Eleven-thirty,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura gasped and tried to get off the floor, the surprise
giving her impetus, but Beebo held her. “You’re
going nowhere, Bo-peep,” she said. Her tone, her self-assurance,
brought out the fight in Laura.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve got to get there. You don’t know how far behind
we are. I could lose my job. And if my father ever—” She
stopped, still squirming to get up. She got as far as her
knees but Beebo grasped her wrists and held her there.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="140" id="page-140"></a>
“I said, you’re not going anywhere, baby,” she said,
and she wasn’t kidding.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, be reasonable. Please. You can’t know how
important it is to me.” It was suddenly important in
a new way, too; it meant distance between her and
Beebo. She was vaguely afraid that Beebo was strong
enough to overwhelm her, to dominate her life. She
needed something else to keep her perspective, her independence.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t know how important <em>you</em> are to <em>me</em>,”
Beebo returned. “What the hell, you’re half a day late
already. Call ’em and tell ’em you’re sick.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t lie worth a damn, Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“You can say ‘I’m sick’ can’t you? It’s a cinch, I do
it all the time. Come on, let me hear you say it.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t. I turn bright red when I lie.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo released her and turned over on her stomach,
laughing. “Jesus, Laur, you could turn bright green.
Who’s going to see you over the phone? Do your damn
radiologists have X-ray eyes?”
</p>

<p>
Laura was on her feet and heading for the phone in
Beebo’s kitchen. She dialed the office, while Beebo got
up and followed her to listen.
</p>

<p>
“Sarah?” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“Laura! Are you all right?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I’m all right. I’ll be down as fast as I can get
there. I’m terribly sorry. Is Dr. Hollingsworth mad?”
</p>

<p>
“No. You know him. He’s awfully nice about these
things. He did ask if you called in, <a id="corr-19"></a>though. He asked
twice. Are you sick?”
</p>

<p>
She looked at Beebo, who grinned at her. “Yes, I’m
sick,” she said, setting her chin.
</p>

<p>
“Well, gee, maybe you’d better not come in, then.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I’ll be all right.” She glared at Beebo who was
laughing at her red cheeks. “I’ll be in right away.”
She hung up and brushed past Beebo haughtily without
looking at her.
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” said Beebo, coming after her, her arms
crossed over her chest. “You’re not going to work.”
</p>

<p>
Laura picked up her wrinkled clothes and said, “Do
you have an iron?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="141" id="page-141"></a>
“You won’t need it.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t go out like this.” Laura held up her rumpled
dress, trying to shake it out.
</p>

<p>
“Then you just can’t go out.” Beebo stretched out on
the bed and made a clucking noise at her. “Poor baby,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“Why is it you’re such an angel in bed and a bitch
out of bed?” Laura snapped.
</p>

<p>
For answer, Beebo only lay on her back and laughed
at her. Laura looked at her lithe body and after a moment
she had to turn away to keep from lying down beside
her. “I don’t even like you, Beebo,” she said
harshly, hoping it would hurt. “I don’t know why I
can’t keep away from you.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s because I’m such an angel in bed, Bo-peep,”
Beebo said. “That’s all you care about. That’s all you
want from me.”
</p>

<p>
Laura whirled and threw one of her shoes at her.
“Bitch!” she exploded. The hurt had backfired. Beebo
spoke the truth. And then Laura turned away to hide the
surprise she always felt when the passion in her burst
to the surface. In silent embarrassment she slipped into
her panty girdle, burningly aware of Beebo’s amused
stare while she pulled it over her hips.
</p>

<p>
“I wouldn’t bother, baby,” Beebo said lazily.
</p>

<p>
“Why not?” Laura wouldn’t look at her.
</p>

<p>
“Number one, I hate the damn things. Number two,
you don’t need one. Number three, you can’t go to work
in a girdle. Period. And that’s all the clothes you’re
going to get.”
</p>

<p>
“What?” Laura turned around.
</p>

<p>
Beebo had gotten off the bed and with two or three
sweeping gestures she grabbed Laura’s clothes and headed
for the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, what are you doing? What’s the matter with
you? Give me those things! Beebo!” Laura tugged at her
but Beebo, laughing, was too much for her. Nix burst
out of the bathroom as Beebo shouldered in. She turned
on the shower full force and threw the clothes over
Laura’s head into the drink. And while Laura was
still spluttering at her she threw Laura in, too, gently,
dumping her on the clothes. Everything, everybody,
was soaked.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="142" id="page-142"></a>
“Beebo, you animal! You’re impossible!” Laura said
furiously. She turned off the water angrily and snatched
up her clothes, wringing them out into the tub. She was
trembling with anger. She faced Beebo with a crimson
face and threw the clothes at her.
</p>

<p>
“Take the girdle off, Bo-peep,” said Beebo with
unconcern. She threw the clothes over a wooden drying
rack. “It doesn’t do a thing for you.”
</p>

<p>
Outraged, Laura tried to scratch her, but Beebo
pinned her back against the bathroom door and kissed
her. Laura bit her and only made her laugh. With a
feeling of excitement so strong it almost made her
sick, Laura knew what was coming.
</p>

<p>
“No!” she exclaimed, suddenly sobbing. “No, I won’t!
No!” But it was submissive, helpless. Beebo forced her
to her knees. Standing spreadlegged beside her, she put
her strong hands behind Laura’s neck and pressed
Laura’s face into her belly. “I said I’d never stop, Bo-peep.
I said never, remember?”
</p>

<p>
“Please, Beebo ...” Frustration and desire were both
so strong in Laura now that she was nearly out of her
mind. Her weakness had got her again, and Beebo would
make the most of it.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was late afternoon before she called Marcie. She
had left under such peculiar circumstances that she
was afraid of what Marcie must be thinking. She
didn’t want to call. Marcie was angry with her, to
Laura’s surprise.
</p>

<p>
“You told me you were coming right back,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura was bewildered. “I meant to,” she said. “I
swear, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“You lied to me.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I didn’t, I just didn’t know—I mean—”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t lie to <a id="corr-20"></a>me any more, Laura. It makes me sick. I
thought we were finally getting close to each other. I
thought we were finally going to be friends.” She
sounded upset.
</p>

<p>
“But Marcie, we are.”
</p>

<p>
“I know where you went, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
Laura went white, and Beebo, who was lounging
around the kitchen making dinner, turned to watch
<a class="pagenum" title="143" id="page-143"></a>
her with a frown. “What do you mean, Marcie?”
Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“I nearly lost my mind,” she said. “I would have
called the police and made a fool of myself. But I called
Jack first, thank God. Laura, why won’t you tell me the
truth? Why won’t you just admit that I make you nervous?
This isn’t the first time I’ve driven you over to
Jack’s. If you don’t tell me what I’m doing wrong how
can I ever do anything right?” Her voice broke. “I
feel as if I’m making your life intolerable. As if you’d
rather move in with Jack and live in sin than put up
with me. You might as well, you spend so much time
in his bed.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie! Marcie, I don’t!” Laura was thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve already talked to him, so don’t deny it, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, honey, listen to me. I—” She looked up at
Beebo and the look on Beebo’s face silenced her. “Marcie,
we’ll have a long talk tonight. I’ll try to explain it
to you. We can’t talk over the phone.”
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause on Marcie’s end. Then she said,
“Are you at Jack’s now?”
</p>

<p>
“I—no—I’m at the office.”
</p>

<p>
“You must have just gotten there. I’ve been trying to
get you all afternoon.”
</p>

<p>
Laura got more bewildered, more tongue-tied, the
more she lied. “Marcie, I can’t talk now,” she said urgently.
“Please. I’ll come right home. I’ll explain.”
</p>

<p>
“All right, Laura. But I’ll tell you right now, I’m
ready to move out if you want me to. I’m sick and
tired of getting on your nerves and not knowing why.”
</p>

<p>
Laura shut her eyes and tried to control her voice.
</p>

<p>
“Laura? Are you still there?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” She cleared her throat. “I’ll see you tonight,
Marcie.” She hung up and turned a pale face to Beebo.
</p>

<p>
Beebo snorted and opened the refrigerator door. “She
still straight?” she asked sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
Laura was stung. “No,” she flung at her. “She’s falling
in love with me.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t kid yourself, Bo-peep.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not kidding. And I’m not blind. She’s jealous
of Jack. She thinks I spent the night with him
and it’s her fault. She wants me home.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="144" id="page-144"></a>
“How sweet,” said Beebo and chucked her under the
chin. Laura pushed her hand away impatiently.
</p>

<p>
“My clothes should be dry by now,” she said, getting
up.
</p>

<p>
“Call Jack,” said Beebo. “Ask him what he told your
roommate.”
</p>

<p>
Laura hated to do anything Beebo suggested, just because
Beebo suggested it. But Beebo was right. Laura
called him at the office. She got him five minutes before
closing.
</p>

<p>
“I found out from Mortin—the bartender at The Cellar,”
he said, “And if you pull another fast one on me,
Mother, by Jesus, I’m going to let you stew in your own
juice. I called you a dozen times last night. You must
have been out on Cloud Nine. Marcie’s mad as hell.
She thinks I’m corrupting you.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. I’m sorry,” Laura said earnestly. “Jack, what
would I do without you?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know. But I wish to hell <em>you</em> did. Marcie’d
like to see me behind bars.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, isn’t that a good sign? I mean she seems almost
jealous.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Christ,” he said, and then he laughed. “You’re
really goofy for her, aren’t you?”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up at Beebo. “Yes,” she said. “I am.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, watch it. I don’t know what to tell you. Nothing
seems to register. If I say ‘she’s not gay’ to you once
more I’ll sound like a broken record. But she’s not. I
don’t want to see you get stabbed, that’s all. Better you
should blow off steam with Beebo until you get over
Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve blown off about as much steam as I can stand,”
Laura said, and Beebo laughed. “I’m through.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t be so dogmatic, Mother mine. You’ll only
have to swallow your words and you’ll look like an ass
doing it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura wouldn’t believe him when he told her Marcie
was straight. She wouldn’t because she didn’t want
to. She had told him, she had even told Beebo now, that
Marcie was falling for her. She didn’t dare believe it
herself, but if somebody else did, maybe somehow that
would help. Her desire, her pride, trapped her. “Thanks
<a class="pagenum" title="145" id="page-145"></a>
again, Jack,” she said. “One of these days I’m going to
do the same for you. I swear.”
</p>

<p>
“One of these days you may have to. And Laura—”
</p>

<p>
“Yes?”
</p>

<p>
“Watch out for Burr. You’re on his black list.”
</p>

<p>
“What’d I do?”
</p>

<p>
“He thinks you’re turning his pretty little sex-pot
into a neurotic. He’s jealous.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled, surprised.
</p>

<p>
“Well?” said Beebo, when she hung up. “Going
home to your little wife?” She grinned.
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, sometimes you make me sick.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. I’m enough to make you go straight. Go sleep
with Jack tonight, it’ll do him a world of good.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, shut up!”
</p>

<p>
“At least it’ll give him a whopper to tell his analyst.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned on her heel and left the room. She felt
her clothes, hanging in the bathroom. They were still
damp, but dry enough to iron. She brought them into
the kitchen. “Where’s the ironing board?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Pretty determined, aren’t you?”
</p>

<p>
“I certainly am.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve got dinner ready. You can eat before you go.”
There was a faint tone of pleading in her voice, as
if she knew the time had gone when sheer force was
useless. Laura had made her mind up.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want another thing from you, not even dinner.”
</p>

<p>
“No, not for another day or two,” Beebo said and her
voice became rougher as she talked. “You just want to
run down for kicks once or twice a week. I’m pretty
damn convenient, aren’t I?” She pulled the board out
from the wall and plugged the iron in, her movements
sharp and angry. Laura felt a little afraid of her. Her
blue eyes snapped and there was no trace of her usual
humor in her face.
</p>

<p>
“You’re the bitch, Laura, not me. You’re using me,”
she said. “Go on, iron the damn thing.” She waved a
hand at Laura’s dress and Laura spread it out on the
board.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry, Beebo,” Laura said, taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="146" id="page-146"></a>
“Sure you are.”
</p>

<p>
“All right, Beebo,” she said softly. “I won’t bother
you any more. Ever.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo snorted at her. “You try it and I’ll beat you, I
swear I will,” she said. “I’ve had enough from you,
Laura. I’m not made of stone. Am I nothing to you?
Am I supposed to <em>believe</em> I’m nothing to you? Do you
think I like to stand and listen to you slobber over
that simpering little roommate of yours? Can she give
you what I can give you? Well damn it, <em>can</em> she?”
</p>

<p>
Laura couldn’t face her, much less answer her. She only
worked the iron over her dress and glanced at Beebo’s
shoes.
</p>

<p>
Beebo’s voice softened a little. “Jesus, what a mess,”
she said, leaning on the refrigerator. “Here I am falling
for you. I ought to have my head examined. I ought to
know better.” She came over to Laura and took the iron
out of her hands and Laura had to look at her. “Laura,”
Beebo said, leaning toward her, “I’m nuts for you. I
wasn’t kidding.” They gazed at each other, Laura surprised
and scared and flattered all at once. “I need you,
baby,” Beebo whispered. “Please stay.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t, Beebo,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t really think you’re in love with that little
blonde, do you?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo shook her head and shut her eyes for a minute.
“Jack says she’s straight. Jack is a shrewd boy. Don’t
you believe him?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“You want to get the Miseries, Baby? That’s the
quickest way.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t know her, Beebo. Even Jack doesn’t know
her as I do. She’s changing. She seems interested in
me. She’s sort of approachable. She doesn’t even want to
see her ex-husband anymore. She wants to stay home at
night with me. She breaks dates with him to do it.”
</p>

<p>
“All right.” Beebo turned away. “Suppose she’s gay.
Suppose she is. What then?” She turned to look sharply
at Laura.
</p>

<p>
Laura was stumped. She had never looked beyond the
present into that possibility. What would it be like,
<a class="pagenum" title="147" id="page-147"></a>
just the two of them, both gay, living together, in love?
“Well, then everything will be wonderful,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Beebo gave a short unpleasant laugh. “Yeah,” she said.
“Wonderful. You walk hand in hand into the sunset.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t mean to hurt you, Beebo. I never made a secret
of my feelings for Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“I never made a secret of mine for you, baby.”
</p>

<p>
“We’d never do anything but fight, Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“Fight and make love. I could live forever on such
a diet.” She smiled a little.
</p>

<p>
“It would drive me crazy. I couldn’t take it.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you think there won’t be fights with your little
Marcie if she turns out gay?”
</p>

<p>
“I suppose there will.”
</p>

<p>
“You know damn well there will. And if she’s
straight, what happens? She reads you the Riot Act.
Calls the cops. Sics her husband on you.”
</p>

<p>
“She wouldn’t do any of those things, Beebo. She’s a
sweet girl. She wouldn’t get wild like you.”
</p>

<p>
“Not according to Jack. You’ve known her four
months. Jack’s known her for years.” Beebo lighted a
cigarette and blew the smoke through her nose. “Want
to know something, Bo-peep? Want to know what it’s
like? I’ve had it happen to me—more than once. If
you’re gay, it just happens now and then, that’s all. You
get the bug for some lovely kid and you can’t keep it
to yourself. You get closer and closer. And if she plays
along it’s worse and worse. And finally you give in
and you grab for her. And she turns to ice in your arms.”
</p>

<p>
She looked at Laura and there was a deep regret in her
eyes. “And she gets up with the God-damnedest sort of
dignity and walks across the room and says ‘I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry for you. Now go away. Don’t talk, don’t try
to explain, I don’t want to hear. It makes me sick. Just
go away, and I won’t tell our friends. You don’t need to
worry. Just so I never see you again.’ It makes you heartsick,
baby. You get so sick inside. You give yourself
the heaves. All you want in God’s world is to get the
hell out of your own skin and be normal. Fade into the
crowd like a normal nobody.” She crushed her cigarette
out, grinding it into the ashtray with her thumb till
the paper burst and the brown tobacco spilled out.

Laura felt closer to her. All the insults of the day faded
in her mind. She walked over to her, her pressed dress
over one shoulder. “Beebo,” she said softly.
</p>

<p>
But Beebo wasn’t ready to let herself be touched. “Just
remember one thing,” she said. “Too many Marcies
in your life, and you commit suicide. That’s what it
is to be gay, Laura. Gay.” Laura stepped back a little
shocked. “Sometimes all it takes is one,” Beebo said.
</p>

<p>
“No,” Laura whispered. “Oh, no.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, baby, go find out for yourself. I can’t stop you,
Jack can’t stop you.” Beebo’s eyes were brilliant with
bitterness, with the hard knowledge of her own experience.
“Go play with your little blonde. You’ll find
out soon enough she has claws. And teeth. And when you
get to playing the wrong games with her, she’ll use them.”
</p>

<p>
“Never!” Laura said. “Even if she’s straight she
won’t hurt me. She’s not that kind.”
</p>

<p>
“She doesn’t <em>have</em> to hurt you, idiot. Can’t I get that
through your head? All she has to do is say ‘no thanks’.
Kindly. Sympathetically. Hell! If you want her bad
enough, you’ll die of it. I know, Laura, I know!” And
she took Laura’s shoulders and shook her head until
Laura felt like sobbing. Beebo released her suddenly
and they stood in silence, unable to talk, heavy with
feeling, trembling.
</p>

<p>
Finally Beebo said quietly, “Go on, baby. Go home
and get it over with. You’ve been warned.” All the fight
seemed gone out of her.
</p>

<p>
When Laura left, Beebo came to the door with Nix
at her heels. She was unsmiling. “Come back, baby,”
she said. “To stay. Or don’t come back at all.” And when
Laura turned away without answering she called after
her, “I mean it!”

Chapter Twelve

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">L</span><span class="postfirstchar">aura</span> entered the penthouse and walked slowly back
to the bedroom. It was hard to imagine Marcie’s mood.
Marcie looked up from her bed, her hair in pincurls.
She was a relief to Laura’s eyes after the stormy, ranting
handsomeness of Beebo. Marcie looked beautiful, even
with tin clips in her hair. But she looked cool, too;
ready for a fight.
</p>

<p>
Laura slipped her jacket off without a word, thinking
of the loud quarrels she and Beth used to have. And
how they resolved them with love. A little curl of excitement
twisted around her innards.
</p>

<p>
“Well?” Marcie said sharply. “Did he throw you down
in the street?”
</p>

<p>
Laura was startled, offended. Marcie had no right to
say such a thing. “What do you mean?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Your dress,” Marcie said, nodding at it.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked down at it. Beebo had dragged it over the
bathroom floor and the dirt, together with a hasty pressing
job, made her look like she’d been through a scuffle.
“Marcie,” she said, trying to control her voice, and not
sure when she started talking what she was going to say,
“Marcie, I didn’t sleep with Jack.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie turned her eyes down to the book she was holding,
and her expression said, Tell me another one. “With
who, then?” she said.
</p>

<p>
Laura pressed her lips together and sat down on Marcie’s
bed. <em>I won’t yell at her</em>, she told herself. <em>I can’t take the
chance. I’d say the truth, I’d blurt it out by mistake.</em>
“Marcie, I just ended up down in the Village.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you wander around all night?”
</p>

<p>
“No. No.” She looked down at the floor. “Well, I—”
</p>

<p>
“You what?” Marcie looked at her.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, I <em>didn’t</em> spend the night with Jack.” Her voice
begged for understanding.
</p>

<p>
“Jack has friends.”
</p>

<p>
Even in her mounting irritation Laura sensed jealousy
<a class="pagenum" title="150" id="page-150"></a>
and it thrilled her. “Yes, Jack has friends. And they aren’t
all men.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t tell me you spent the night with a girl. Ha!
That’s even better. You just hang around with anybody
who’s handy, don’t you.”
</p>

<p>
“You aren’t very choosy yourself, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“Only with Burr!” Marcie flashed angrily. “I only sleep
with Burr. And I was <em>married</em> to him. Besides, I haven’t
let him touch me for weeks. You’ve never been married,
not to Jack or anybody else.”
</p>

<p>
“And I’ve never slept with Jack or anybody else.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t believe you!”
</p>

<p>
Laura stood up and looked down at her. “You don’t
have to, Marcie,” she said. “What the hell do you care who
I sleep with? Or why? Are you guardian of my morals?
Yours aren’t perfect, you know. I haven’t slept with Jack,
for your information. Not once. But if I had, what would
it matter? You thought it was all a good joke at first.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie’s face began to color. She put her book down
and looked diffidently at Laura, who was standing by her
dresser taking off her clothes. Marcie ran her fingers over
her lips, as if warning herself to shut up and Laura
thought to herself, <em>Just like me. Just like me when Beth
used to taunt me. I wanted her so. And I was so afraid.</em>
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t know it would get so serious, at first. With
Jack,” Marcie said, her attitude softening. “I feel like it’s
my fault, what you’re doing, and I—I feel real bad about
it. I’m scared. Maybe you’ll get into trouble, maybe you’ll
blame me then. You get so <em>odd</em> sometimes. I guess I’m
just being selfish, Laur. But—” She gave an audible sigh
that made Laura turn to glance at her. “Laur, will you
tell me—will you <em>please</em> tell me—why you keep running
out of here at all hours of the night? What am I doing
wrong? If you don’t tell me, I’m going to move out of
here tomorrow, I swear. I can’t stand it!”
</p>

<p>
Laura had to tell her something. She had to lie and she
couldn’t lie and as she walked toward Marcie’s bed, she felt
something like panic at the thought of losing her. But
when she sat down beside her something popped into her
head and saved her. She didn’t have to stammer and
blush, and she didn’t have to confess her homosexuality.
She told Marcie about her father.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="151" id="page-151"></a>
She was almost ashamed to recount what had happened.
It was humiliating, and it looked like a bald bid
for sympathy. And yet she wanted terribly to touch Marcie’s
heart, to win her compassion. “He told the clerk
he had no daughter.” She finished. Her shame made her
drop her gaze and cover her face with her hands. But
Marcie, suddenly moved, put her arms around Laura and
cried.
</p>

<p>
“Forgive me, Laura,” she whispered. “I’ve been a stupid
idiot about this. I don’t know what got into me. Honey,
forgive me, I should never have tortured you about it.
Whatever your father did to you, he must be a beast.
He doesn’t deserve to live.”
</p>

<p>
But that was going too far, even for Laura. There had
been violent moments of shame and rejection, when she
wanted to kill him. But there were others when she wanted
only to be allowed to love him. “Don’t say that, Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie looked up at her, her face so close that she gave
Laura a start. “Don’t tell me you still feel anything for
him?” she said. “After what he did to you?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know what I feel. I hate him sometimes,
Marcie, I hate him so much sometimes that I’m terrified of
myself. I think ‘If he were with me right now—if he suddenly
appeared—I’d kill him. I’d <em>kill</em> him!’” And she
said it with such force that Marcie shuddered. “And then,
other times, all I want to do is cry. Just cry till there
aren’t any tears left. Get down on my knees and beg him
to love me.”
</p>

<p>
“It seems so crazy, Laur. My Dad is so nice and ordinary.
I couldn’t take it if he ever hurt me like yours. God,
you must feel so alone. Laura, let me be close to you. Let
me be friends with you. You haven’t up to now, you
know.”
</p>

<p>
Laura began to feel dizzy. <em>This is too much, this is too
easy</em>, she thought, and pangs of conscience came up in
her. <em>All I have to do is pull her close, caress her, kiss
her, all I have to do—oh, my God! But I can’t! It’d be
like corrupting her, like leading her astray. Damn! Why
have I got a conscience? Beth didn’t have one. Neither
does Beebo. Why me? Why can’t I just take her?</em> But
she was too afraid.
</p>

<p>
“Laura, talk to me. You’re off in another world again.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="152" id="page-152"></a>
Laura looked down at her, balanced between desire and
fear, between desire and conscience, between desire and
... desire, desire....
</p>

<p>
“Marcie,” she whispered. “Remember the night you
wanted to touch tongues?”
</p>

<p>
Marcie laughed a little, embarrassed. “Yes,” she said. “I
told Burr about it. He says I’m cracked.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was shocked. “You told Burr?” she said, hurt by
the betrayal.
</p>

<p>
“Well, don’t look so horrified.” Marcie giggled. “Don’t
tell me you didn’t tell Jack?”
</p>

<p>
And Laura, by her sudden confusion, admitted that she
had. With the admission, and the shock, came a clear head.
She stood up. Marcie watched her. “I’m going to bed,”
Laura said. “I’m too beat to talk. I’m just worn out.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie let her go without a word. Her eyes followed
Laura around the room. Laura ignored her studiously.
She was asleep within minutes after she lay down, too
tired even to worry.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura knew she would have to lie to Sarah in the morning
about where she spent the day before. She made up her
mind to do it fast and simply. She organized a little story
about a sick headache and she delivered it quickly, even
before Sarah had a chance to ask. Sarah took it at face
value.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, she called Marcie and told her
she’d be late. “I’ve got to stay here and catch up,” she explained.
“I’ve done nothing but get behind the whole time
Jean’s been away. I just can’t seem to get the work done.
I’m not going to lose this job.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re wearing yourself out, Laur. I think you’re
crazy. You can get a much softer job and earn a lot more
money. In fact I talked to Mr. Marquardt about you.”
</p>

<p>
“You <em>what</em>?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” She laughed. “Today. I thought it would be fun
if we could be in the same office. Besides, I never saw
anybody work like you do. It’s insane, when all you have
to do is sit around.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, I don’t <em>want</em> to sit around! I don’t need help!
I can do this myself. I know you did it out of friendship
but damn it, I <em>want</em> to work. I don’t want to sit around
<a class="pagenum" title="153" id="page-153"></a>
on my behind all day, counting the minutes till the next
coffee break.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie was taken aback by the forcefulness of it. “Laura,
I didn’t mean—” she began, and her voice was hurt.
</p>

<p>
“I know, I know. I’m grateful, Marcie, forgive me. But
I have something to prove, staying here. It’s only hard at
first, when you’re learning. It’ll get easier. And in another
two weeks there’ll be three of us at the office.”
</p>

<p>
She knew she had hurt Marcie’s feelings and when she
hung up she wondered if it was worth it. <em>Why don’t I
quit? Why don’t I take a soft job, like Marcie?</em> But she
knew what scorn her father would pour on a job like that.
It was only the tough ones, the ones that took it out of
you, that demanded your best, that he had any respect
for.
</p>

<p>
Laura stayed on until nearly eight by herself. The building
was crypt-quiet and she was deep in the last round of
reports she intended to do, when the door opened and a
voice said, “Laura!”
</p>

<p>
Laura gave a gasp of shock, throwing her hands over
her face. She was so startled that she found herself trembling
all over. For a moment she was unable to move.
</p>

<p>
“Laura?” he said again.
</p>

<p>
Laura turned slowly around in her swivel chair, taking
her hands away from her face. She looked up, her face
cold and white and resentful. It was Burr. She didn’t say
a word. She only stared at him in surprise. She felt overflowing
with hatred for him, as if Merrill Landon were
standing there.
</p>

<p>
Burr was somewhat taken aback. “Marcie said you were
down here,” he said, a little awkwardly. “I wanted to talk
to you.” He shrugged, and pulled Sarah’s chair out from
her desk, sitting down about five feet from Laura. She
said nothing.
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” he said, embarrassed. “We started out to be
pretty good friends, you and I.” He turned his hat around
and around in his hands, studying it while he talked.
“Then—I don’t know why—we seemed to—well, we just
didn’t have anything to say to each other. I guess maybe
because we always talked about books. And Marcie. You
don’t seem to be reading any books any more. And Marcie—well....”
He seemed at a loss for words here. He
<a class="pagenum" title="154" id="page-154"></a>
twirled his hat assiduously, as if that might give him
some answers. But it was no help. “Of course, I haven’t
been around much lately, either,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Laura was suddenly a little scared. But she was determined
not to be any more helpful than his hat. She
only glared at him. She still hadn’t said a word to him.
<em>After all</em>, she thought, <em>I haven’t done anything. He still
hasn’t said what he wants.</em>
</p>

<p>
“Well, frankly Laura, Marcie’s changed. I don’t know
what the hell’s come over her. I thought maybe you could
help me out.” He eyed her closely. “I guess it sounds
pretty silly. But I love her, and all of a sudden I can’t
even see her any more. I can’t get near her. She’s just
not interested.” When Laura still said nothing he went
on, “I mean, I know it’s not your problem, but I thought,
being her roommate, you know, you might help me out.”
He looked up at her, smiling a little, but his smile faded
when he saw the look on her face.
</p>

<p>
Laura was thinking, <em>Why the hell should I help you?</em>
But she said, “Why don’t you stop fighting with her,
Burr? Maybe that would help.” Her voice was faintly sarcastic.
</p>

<p>
“When we fought,” he said, “at least we could always
make up. That was fun. We both enjoyed it. Then all of
a sudden, a couple of weeks ago, Marcie wouldn’t fight
any more. I don’t know what the hell got into her. She
just got quiet and thoughtful. She wouldn’t fight and
she wouldn’t make love. I’m beginning to think she needed
to fight before she could make love. Maybe that’s the
only thing that excited her.” He looked quizzically at
Laura.
</p>

<p>
“How would I know? Maybe <em>you</em> needed it,” Laura said,
and shrugged.
</p>

<p>
By her reticence she had made Burr uncomfortable.
“Well, I know it isn’t exactly the sort of thing to bother
you with,” he said, making a visible effort to control his
temper. “But damn it, Laura, I love her. She’s my wife.
I still think of her that way, I can’t help it. I was a
fool ever to let her have that divorce.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you think getting married again would change any
of that?” Laura said. “Don’t you think it would just be
the same old fights all over again?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="155" id="page-155"></a>
“I don’t know.” He shook his head. “Maybe. But I’d
rather live with Marcie and fight than live without her
and be this miserable.”
</p>

<p>
“Does fighting make you happy?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t mind it. Not enough to make me give her up
again.”
</p>

<p>
“You talk like a kid, Burr,” she said, wondering what
authority gave her the right to pronounce judgments. And
then she reasoned that Burr himself gave her the right.
He asked for it. Okay, he’d get it. “If you want to win
Marcie back, find out what’s the trouble and change it.
If you want my opinion—and I guess that’s why you’re
here—I don’t think you should go back together. I think
Jack’s right; you were never meant for each other. It’s
purely physical.”
</p>

<p>
These were hard words, but even so Laura wasn’t prepared
for the effect they produced. Burr went pale and
his mouth dropped open. Suddenly he stood up. “Jack
said that?” he said incredulously. “<em>Jack?</em>”
</p>

<p>
And Laura went a little sick. She had violated a confidence,
without even meaning to. The one person she
couldn’t bear to hurt, to alienate right now, was Jack.
“Maybe I’m mistaken,” she said quickly. But who else
could it be? “It was me, Burr, I don’t know why I said
that. It wasn’t Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, it was <em>you</em>!” He had been surprised into a fury.
He had been nursing his grievance, trying to talk calmly
to Laura. Now his feelings got out of control. “Well, I’ll
tell you something, Laura. I don’t believe you. It was
Jack or you wouldn’t have said so. You’re a lousy liar.
Now suppose you explain something to me.” He leaned
with his fists on her desk.
</p>

<p>
Laura leaned away from him, frightened now. “Calm
down, Burr,” she said, but he ignored her.
</p>

<p>
“You and Jack can both go to hell!” he said. “You’ve
been psychoanalyzing the situation over a couple of beers
in your spare time. A couple of cocktail-hour psychologists.
Oh, don’t think I can’t see it. Well, I don’t give a damn
for what you think. I love Marcie!” He was shouting. “I
love her! And I’d like to know why the hell she doesn’t
love <em>me</em> any more. <em>Why</em>, Laura? <em>You</em> tell me. Why would
she rather stay home with you at night than go out with
<a class="pagenum" title="156" id="page-156"></a>
me? Why does she talk about Laura, Laura, Laura all the
time? Laura reads this, Laura does that, Laura says! God,
I’m sick of it!” His ugly suspicions exploded in her face.
</p>

<p>
“She doesn’t, Burr, you’re mistaken.”
</p>

<p>
“Mistaken!” he roared, his face turning scarlet. “Mistaken!
Oh, you’re a bitch, Laura! Mistaken! And she
won’t make love to me any more. She won’t see me. You’re
the only one she gives a damn about. She can’t get enough
of you at home, she’s got to get you a job in her own
office. Yes, she told me about it,” he interrupted himself,
when Laura gave a little gasp.
</p>

<p>
“Burr, you fool, you’re making things up,” Laura said.
She looked cold and controlled, but there was a terror inside
her that he couldn’t see. She rose in her seat and
faced him, their faces not a foot apart. “Now get out of
here.” It had worked before with other men. It had to
work now with Burr. She would give him no satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t tell me you’re not up to some God-damn funny
business,” he growled.
</p>

<p>
“I’m not up to any God-damn funny business,” she replied
quietly.
</p>

<p>
“Then what’s all this crap about touching tongues? In
the dark? In bed? Why does Marcie follow you around like
you were Svengali?”
</p>

<p>
“She doesn’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t tell me she doesn’t!” he shouted in a fury,
bringing his fist down with a huge thump on her desk.
“I know she does. I know!”
</p>

<p>
“Burr, you’re insane with jealousy.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s going on between you two?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’m a bad liar, you said
it yourself. If I had ever touched Marcie I couldn’t lie
about it.” She glared at him, her face a mask, almost
white; her eyes brilliant and her body tense.
</p>

<p>
“You want her. Admit it.” He was quiet now, but it
was the quiet of hatred.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t admit anything. Who the hell are you? I don’t
owe you any explanations.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s my wife.”
</p>

<p>
“So she’s your wife. She’s <em>my</em> roommate. She prefers
to live with me.” Laura was dangerously near throwing
her advantage in his face.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="157" id="page-157"></a>
“You <em>are</em> queer! By God, I knew it!”
</p>

<p>
“How dare you!” And the hot blood came to Laura’s
face. “Get out of here! You bastard!”
</p>

<p>
“All right, deny it, then!”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not accountable to you, Burr. I won’t admit or
deny anything. I don’t have to. I’ll call the police if you
don’t get out of here. I’ll sue you for libel if you make
that accusation in public. I never laid a hand on Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s not what Marcie said.”
</p>

<p>
For a shocked second Laura was unable to move or respond.
Then she gasped and staggered a little. There was
a terrible silence, heavy with the awful meaning of his
words.
</p>

<p>
Laura sat down shaking. She began to cry.
</p>

<p>
Burr watched her in silent fury for a moment. Then he
said, “I thought that’d get you, you bitch.” His voice was
low and dry. “I came here to talk to you like a human
being, to give you a chance. But you act like a God-damn
queen. You act like I was in the wrong, not you! Like I
was an animal. Well, you’re no better. You’re a pervert,
Laura. And I’m going to get Marcie away from you if I
have to call out the cops to do it. You’re not going to
touch her again.” He turned sharply and started out.
</p>

<p>
“Burr! Burr! My God, wait! What did she say? What
did she tell you?”
</p>

<p>
“Can’t you guess?”
</p>

<p>
“She made it up, Burr, believe me. Please believe me.”
She was begging him now. “You know how she is.”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah, I know how she is. She didn’t make this up.”
</p>

<p>
“She did! She’s lying.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s telling the truth. You’re perverting her. It’s obvious,
even I can see it. Perverting her! My Marcie!” He
almost wept when he said it, and Laura instinctively put
a hand to her throat as if to protect herself.
</p>

<p>
“Burr,” she said and her voice was deeply intense and
<a id="corr-21"></a>quiet, “I swear to you by God and Heaven and everything
I hold sacred, I never—”
</p>

<p>
“You hold nothing sacred! You’re a walking profanity!
You’re a mockery of womanhood. You’re queer.
<em>Queer!</em> And you’re infecting Marcie. I’m going to get her
away from you. Now. Tonight!” And he turned on his
heel and walked out.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="158" id="page-158"></a>
Laura called after him until he walked into the last operating
elevator and disappeared. She sobbed wildly for a
minute, collapsed in her chair. Then, as if electrified,
she picked up the phone and dialed the penthouse, as fast
as her trembling fingers would let her. She almost died of
impatience before Marcie answered. “Hello?” Marcie said.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie! Marcie, what have you done to me? Answer
me!”
</p>

<p>
“Laur?” Marcie’s voice sounded small and frightened.
“What’s the matter, honey?”
</p>

<p>
“Burr just left me. I thought he was going to kill me.
Marcie, what did you tell him?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Laura.” Marcie’s voice was only the faintest whisper.
“I had no idea he’d—I didn’t think he’d bother you.
I didn’t think he’d even mention it.”
</p>

<p>
“What did you tell him, Marcie?” Laura’s voice
sounded almost hysterical.
</p>

<p>
“I—we quarreled.” Marcie was crying quietly while she
talked. “We quarreled, for the first time in weeks. It was
terrible. As if to make up for all those weeks when we
didn’t fight at all. He accused me of—forgive me, Laura,
I’m ashamed to say these words—of falling in love with
you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura groaned despairingly.
</p>

<p>
“Laur, I’m so sorry. I guess I talked about you all the
time. I get interested in somebody, or something and I
just don’t talk about anything else for a while. I talked
about you because I admire you so much. I—well, you
know. He got the wrong idea, that’s all. But I didn’t realize
it, I swear I didn’t, Laur. I would have stopped him if
I had. And then we had this quarrel tonight and I said
some things I shouldn’t have.”
</p>

<p>
“What things? <em>What things</em>, Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
Marcie sobbed. “He accused me of trying to tempt you,
of egging you on. Oh, Laura, this is too horrible, I can’t
go on.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me!”
</p>

<p>
“And I got so furious. It was so unfair. You know we
haven’t done anything! He was just determined to believe
it. He can’t believe I just don’t want to see him any more,
that’s too hard on his damned pride. So he was just waiting
for somebody to blame, and there you were. And I
was so damn mad at him. It was hopeless, there was no
<a class="pagenum" title="159" id="page-159"></a>
talking to him. He was losing me because somebody else
was winning me, that’s the only way he could see it. So
I finally just shouted at him, ‘All right, have it your way,
you big fool. Believe what you want to believe, I can’t
stop you!’” She was interrupted by her own sobs.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie,” Laura said, making a huge effort to control
herself, “Did you tell him that I ...” She could hardly
get the words out. “... made love to you?”
</p>

<p>
“No! No, Laura!” Marcie cried.
</p>

<p>
“Did you tell him anything specific?”
</p>

<p>
“Absolutely not, I swear!”
</p>

<p>
Laura gave a sigh of relief. She began to cry again herself.
After a moment she said softly, “Marcie, he’s on his
way to the penthouse. He says he’s not going to let you
spend another night in the same apartment with me. I’m
infecting you.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Laura, honey. God!”
</p>

<p>
“So you’d better lock the door.”
</p>

<p>
“We don’t have a key!”
</p>

<p>
“Get one from the janitor.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m afraid of him. He’s down in the basement. It’s so
dark down there and he always tries to make a pass at
me.”
</p>

<p>
“I shouldn’t think that would bother you.” Laura
couldn’t help the dig; it made her feel better.
</p>

<p>
“Laura, he’s nuts. He’s a meatball.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, damn it, do <em>something</em>!” Laura cried, exasperated.
Then she forced herself to speak quietly. “All right,
call the police,” she said. “Say your former husband is
threatening you. Say you’re afraid of him, you think he
wants to kill you. Say anything! Tell them he’s on his
way over right now and you want protection.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura, I’ve never done such a thing in my life! Poor
Burr! I’ve known him since I was a kid, I worshipped
him.”
</p>

<p>
“You stopped worshipping him in a hurry when you
had to live with him. Listen to me, there’s not much time.
If you don’t want him to do something violent you’d better
get some protection. I can’t fight him off for you.
Unless you want to go with him tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Go with him! That bastard! After what he did tonight?
He can go to hell. Without me.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s where he’d like to see <em>me</em>,” Laura said. “I’d better
<a class="pagenum" title="160" id="page-160"></a>
not show up. I’ll stay down here for another hour or
so. I’ll call you before I come home, to be sure the coast
is clear.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura? I hate to call the police, Laur. It makes me
sick.” She sounded miserable.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie for God’s sake, you’re a taxpayer. You’re entitled
to protection. Burr was in a fit when he left here.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie began to weep again. “Laura, I’m so sorry. I’m
so sorry,” she said softly over the phone.
</p>

<p>
Laura’s heart softened too. “Oh Marcie,” she moaned.
“I guess it really isn’t anybody’s fault. Burr’s still in love
with you. None of us realized how much. He had to be
jealous of somebody, and he knew you weren’t dating anybody
else. We’ve all been pretty stupid about the whole
thing. I just hope to God it blows over.” All of a sudden
she felt powerfully tired.
</p>

<p>
“It’s all my fault,” Marcie said. “Everything’s my
fault. I’ll make it up to you, Laura, I promise.”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind, honey. Just keep out of trouble tonight.
I’ll be home about ten. I’ll call you first.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay.” Marcie was still crying when she hung up.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
For a long time Laura sat at her desk, staring into space.
The windows were black, gold-spangled with the city
night, and everything was still.
</p>

<p>
She got up, feeling weak and tired, and yet not desperate
or frightened any more. Burr had no proof of anything.
Marcie would deny everything. And if things went
as it seemed they must, Burr would act like a crazy man
and convince the police he was bent on violence. Marcie
would be genuinely frightened and it would show. There
ought not to be any difficulty about it. She got her things
together and turned out the office light.
</p>

<p>
The hall to the elevator was bare and echoing as she
walked down it. The elevator boy was silent, as if he too
had been touched by the vast quiet of the night.
</p>

<p>
Laura walked out on the street. People hustled by,
lights shone, cars honked. But it all seemed far away, not
very real. Her senses registered only half of what they perceived.
</p>

<p>
<em>Where shall I go? I’d better not try to go home for a
while. Not till Burr leaves. Another hour, at least.</em>
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="161" id="page-161"></a>
She looked at her watch: eight-thirty. She walked
slowly, gazing ahead of her like a sleepwalker. <em>I’ll go
somewhere where I can sit down and read</em>, she thought.
She bought a magazine from a corner stand and sauntered
on another couple of blocks until she saw the McAlton on
the next corner.
</p>

<p>
She almost exclaimed aloud, as if the hotel had been
sneaking up on her while she marked time on the sidewalk.
She stopped in her tracks to stare at it and then
looked self-consciously into a shop window. After a few
minutes she moved on to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
<em>If I just sit in a corner, as if I’m waiting for somebody,
they can’t do anything. I’ll just read this thing till nine-thirty
or so.</em>
</p>

<p>
A tiny unworded excitement knotted itself around her
heart and stuck there, prepared to stay for as long as
Laura stayed in the lobby. She didn’t go over to the desk.
She just sat down in an alcove on a leather covered sofa
next to a fat middle-aged woman. She read until nine-thirty.
</p>

<p>
Then she got up and walked halfway across the lobby
to the phone booths, entered one, and dialed the penthouse.
Marcie answered.
</p>

<p>
“Is everything all right, Marcie? It’s Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” She sounded tired, reticent.
</p>

<p>
“What happened?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing. The policeman got here right after Burr did.
Burr was yelling like a crazy man. The policeman took
him out and told him to stop bothering me or they’d take
him down and book him. He was furious. He cried. But
he went. Damn it, he deserved it, after what he did to
you.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you alone now?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
Laura suddenly felt enormously relieved. “Thank God,”
she said.
</p>

<p>
“Will you be right home?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Right away.” She hung up and left the booth,
putting some change in her purse. She felt much better.
Burr was mad as hell, that was certain. But for the moment
he would have to watch himself; he would have to
be careful. Marcie was disgusted with him. Obviously force
<a class="pagenum" title="162" id="page-162"></a>
was the wrong way to get her back. And suddenly Laura
saw her father.
</p>

<p>
Merrill Landon was about twenty feet from her, his
face turned profile to her, talking to some men.
</p>

<p>
Laura gave a low cry, almost inaudible, and her heart
stopped. The knot around it gave a tremendous squeeze,
like a big angry fist, and stopped it altogether for a moment.
It started again with a tremendous thump. She
darted toward the little alcove, her face averted, but found
all the seats taken. She stood facing away from him for a
minute, her heart kicking wildly, wondering frantically
what to do.
</p>

<p>
<em>I’ve got to be calm, I’ve got to be calm</em>, she said under
her breath, but each time she said it it seemed more hysterical.
She gulped convulsively and barely heard someone
say in her ear, “Excuse me, dear. Are you all right?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Yes, thanks,” she said, her voice staccato, afraid
to identify her questioner.
</p>

<p>
She shut her eyes tight for a minute. <em>If I just walk out
quickly, he’ll never see me. The lobby is full, there are
dozens of people in here. He’s not looking for me, he’s
talking to some men, he won’t see me. I’ll just walk out.</em>
</p>

<p>
She took a very careful glance behind her. He was facing
her now, but not seeing her, gesturing, talking, engrossed
in his words. He would never see her. For a second
she permitted herself the luxury of looking hard at
him; his big maleness, his strong face that could never be
called handsome and yet compelled interest. That face
that almost never smiled at Laura since she was five years
old. That face she was condemned to love.
</p>

<p>
Laura turned away then and began to walk toward the
door, keeping her face averted, hurrying, her heart pounding
as if she were running up a steep hill. Near the door
she slowed down a little. <em>I’ll never see him again</em>, she told
herself fiercely. <em>Just one more glance. It will have to last
me my life.</em> She turned around slowly, carefully, just five
feet from the door and safety.
</p>

<p>
He was looking at her. Looking straight at her, as if he
had been following her through the crowd with his eyes,
not quite sure but wondering. For a split second Laura
didn’t believe it; thought he didn’t really see her and was
just looking that way. But then he cried, “Laura!” in his
<a class="pagenum" title="163" id="page-163"></a>
big rough voice, and her eyes went huge with fear and she
gasped and turned and ran as if the devil were after her.
She ran headlong, panicky, her heart huge and desperate,
struggling to get out of her throat. She ran with all her
strength and with an unreasoning terror whipping her
heels, all the way to the subway. She never once looked
back. People turned to stare, they jumped out of the way
and she collided with a dozen of them. She almost fell
down the subway steps and ran and dodged and shoved
her way into the ladies’ rest room.
</p>

<p>
There, she fell on the floor, whimpering, crying despairingly,
unable to lift herself off the filth of the black floor
and completely unaware of anything but the hysterical fear
that gripped her. After a while she felt hands on her
shoulders and she gave a wild scream and sat up. A terrified
Negress was bending over her, saying, “There now,
there now.” Her eyes were all whites.
</p>

<p>
Laura panted, speechless, gasping for breath. She
leaned exhausted against the door of a booth until her
wind came back to her and then she tried to get up. The
Negro woman helped her, handling her like heirloom
china, watching her every second for fear she would take
off on another fit.
</p>

<p>
Laura half staggered to the wash basin and turned the
water on. She looked at her haggard face in the mirror
and an attack of real crying, soothing relief with real tears,
overwhelmed her. “Father, Father, Father,” she cried
softly, her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
“Can I help you, Miss?” the colored woman asked.
She was scared by Laura’s behavior, but fascinated.
</p>

<p>
Laura shook her head.
</p>

<p>
After a moment’s pause the woman said, “You came
in here like a bat out of hell. You was out of your mind,
honey, that’s for sure. Was some sonofabitch chasin’ you?”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands down to look at the woman in the
cracked mirror over the basin. She nodded.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I never seen a girl so scared in my life. Never.”
She shook her head positively. “You better get yourself
some help, honey. Is he still out there?”
</p>

<p>
At this Laura went so white that she frightened the
woman again, who said, “There now, there now. Didn’t
mean to start nothin’. Don’t go off like that again.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="164" id="page-164"></a>
Laura turned around to look at her. And in her awful
unhappiness she went to her and put her arms around
her, to the bottomless astonishment of the woman, and
wept on her shoulder. “I never had a mother,” Laura
sobbed. “I never had a mother.” And her heart was broken.
</p>

<p>
The woman held her like a child and said, “There now,
there now. Everybody’s got a mother, even you.”
</p>

<p>
“Nobody knows me. I don’t even know myself. I don’t
know what I’m doing here,” she said brokenly. “I’m a
stranger in this world.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, now,” said the woman, “Everybody’s a stranger
when you look at it that way. But everybody got a chance
to find a little love. That’s the most important thing.
When you got a little love, the rest don’t seem so strange
or sad no more. There now, honey, there now.”
</p>

<p>
Laura suddenly shied away from her. “Don’t call me
honey!” she said, her face twisted with misery.
</p>

<p>
The Negro woman let her go, shaking her head. “You
pretty sick, girl,” she said. “You need a doctor, and that’s
the truth.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned and walked out of the rest room on shaking
legs. Outside she looked warily up and down the waiting
platform. Only a handful of people were there. A train
had gone through just after she entered the rest room and
had taken most of the crowd with it. She waited in silence
for the next train.
</p>

<p>
The woman came out of the rest room after Laura. She
stood some distance from her, staring at her with a mixture
of distrust and pity, until the train arrived and the
crowd separated them.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura came home too exhausted to talk about it, to be
embarrassed with Marcie about the fight with Burr. She
was so full of her experience, so absorbed in her father,
that nobody else seemed real. She almost fell into her bed,
with hardly a word to Marcie, and lay there wrapped up
in herself, crying quietly for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Things were no better in the morning. Somehow the
enormity of Burr’s accusation hung between them like a
curtain. They could look at each other only furtively;
they couldn’t speak. They were embarrassed, a little afraid
<a class="pagenum" title="165" id="page-165"></a>
of each other, and it made them overly polite. All they
said was, “Excuse me,” “pass the cream, please,” “I’m
sorry.” Laura had the additional burden of her terrible
flight from her father to keep her both silent and preoccupied.
</p>

<p>
She was unable to figure it out. She knew she didn’t
want to talk to him, to show him any forgiveness at all,
to satisfy his curiosity about her—if he had any. She only
wanted a glimpse of him; she wanted to reassure herself
that he was still in New York, even though she knew he
was. And she knew he might see her if she hung around
his hotel. And she was ashamed that he should see her and
know how important he was to her, even after his cruel
denial of her. All these things were plain to Laura and yet
when she looked back on the night before it seemed incredible.
Especially her own terror.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
They parted for work without more than a perfunctory
goodby. Laura knew it was going to be a rough day. She
had had almost no sleep. And for the first time since she
took the job she didn’t even give a damn what happened.
She was too engrossed in herself and the urgent unnameable
feelings that plagued her. Not even the head start
she had given herself the night before encouraged her. It
only reminded her of Burr and the ugly quarrel they had
had. The thought of her father, which usually spurred her
on, even on the darkest days, now filled her with a shaky
apprehension and so engaged her mind that it was hard
for her to think about anything else.
</p>

<p>
Bombshells fell around her all day. Marcie called in
tears at ten to say she couldn’t stand it any longer and
wouldn’t Laura forgive her. And Laura was forced to
take time out, while Dr. Hagstrom was in the room,
to reassure her. Marcie wouldn’t be put off; there was
no help for it.
</p>

<p>
Sarah reminded her that they were all going out for
dinner that night. They had arranged to meet Jack and
Carl Jensen at a small bar a couple of blocks away for
cocktails and to go on from there. It wasn’t until Sarah
mentioned it that Laura even remembered it, and then
she was dismayed.
</p>

<p>
Just before lunch, Jack called.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="166" id="page-166"></a>
“Laura,” he said firmly, “what the hell are you trying
to do to me?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing. What’s the matter, Jack, can’t you make it
tonight?”
</p>

<p>
“Tonight be damned. I’m liable to get skinned alive.
Right <em>now</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“Did something go wrong with Terry?” Laura was
startled into attention.
</p>

<p>
He paused a minute before answering, taken aback
to hear his lover mentioned right out on the phone.
“No,” he said. “I spoil him rotten, but that’s nothing
new. Guess again.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Jack, I don’t have time for guessing games,
we’re—”
</p>

<p>
“I know, you’re behind. Burr told me you stayed late
last night to catch up.”
</p>

<p>
“Burr told you? Oh!” Suddenly she remembered.
“What’s the matter with me?”
</p>

<p>
“You tell me. I’d like to know. Burr was real sweet.
He told me I was a lousy bastard and no friend of his,
and I could take my psychoanalysis and cram it. Oh,
he told me some very interesting things. He told me
you’re queer and you’re perverting Marcie, and you
two are lovers, and Marcie sicked the cops on him
last night, and God knows what else. Would you care to
explain to me what the hell is going on? Just so I
won’t put my foot in my mouth? You know how it is.”
There was the forgiveness in his bitter humor and
it made her miserable.
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I’m so terribly sorry,” she said. “I blurted out
something about the way you felt about Burr and Marcie.
I was trying to calm him down. I should have
known better. He was out of his mind.”
</p>

<p>
“Since when are you and Marcie lovers?”
</p>

<p>
“We’re not! I would have told you, you <em>know</em> that.”
She glanced surreptitiously across the office at Sarah,
but Sarah had her eyes on her work. “Burr got it into
his head we were because Marcie talked about me so
much. Because she stayed home and wouldn’t go out with
him. When he accused her, it made her so mad she just
told him, ‘Okay, believe it.’ And he did. I thought he
was going to kill me last night.”
</p>

<p>
At this Sarah did look up, but Laura didn’t notice.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="167" id="page-167"></a>
“Well, that’s a hell of a story,” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
“It’s the truth, Jack! I swear.”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind the truth. You’ve got me in a lovely
mess. Burr thinks I promoted the whole affair.”
</p>

<p>
“My God! Jack, what’ll we do?”
</p>

<p>
“What <em>can</em> we do? Have you done anything with
Marcie you wouldn’t want to write home about?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing! I wish to God now I had. As long as he’s
going to believe it anyway.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no! Christ! Whatever you do, Laura, don’t touch
Marcie. Not till Burr straightens out. Never, if you
have any sense.”
</p>

<p>
Laura wouldn’t answer him. She felt closer to winning
Marcie, in spite of their awkwardness with
each other this morning, than she ever had. She
wouldn’t make any promises to Jack.
</p>

<p>
“You hear me, Mother?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.”
</p>

<p>
He apparently took that for a promise. “And one more
thing.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t take any more right now.”
</p>

<p>
“This won’t hurt. What have you done to Beebo?”
</p>

<p>
“<em>Done</em> to her? Nothing. Ask her what she’s done to
me,” she said, and her voice was hard. Sarah watched
her with considerable interest now.
</p>

<p>
“Keep your voice down, Mother,” Jack said. “Beebo’s
goofy for you. And when she gets a girl on her
mind, that girl had better watch out. She’s a stubborn
bitch.”
</p>

<p>
“So am I,” Laura snapped.
</p>

<p>
“She’s in love with you, Laura. Don’t cross her.”
</p>

<p>
“I’d walk all over her if I could. She treats me like a
slave.”
</p>

<p>
“Christ, keep your voice down,” Jack said, and
Laura was surprised at her own lack of caution. Usually
she was meticulously careful. Today, nothing seemed
to matter. “She’s in love with you,” Jack said. “That
explains a lot of things.”
</p>

<p>
“It doesn’t excuse them. Besides, she isn’t. How do
you know she is?”
</p>

<p>
“She said so.”
</p>

<p>
“When?”
</p>

<p>
“Last night.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="168" id="page-168"></a>
Laura couldn’t help being flattered. The pleasure in
her was warm and sudden and overwhelmed her bad
conscience briefly. “I’m not going to see her again,”
she told Jack. This time she almost whispered, which
intrigued Sarah still more.
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed. “Have it your way,” he said. “Only
don’t drag me into your messes any more, Mother. I’ve
got enough of my own.”
</p>

<p>
“Is everything all right between—I mean—” She
looked over at Sarah for the first time and surprised
Sarah staring at her. Sarah went quickly back to work
and Laura felt suddenly nervous. “Jack, I’d better hang
up. We’ll talk tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay. See you at five-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
Laura spent the rest of the day reassuring herself, <em>I’ll
never go back to that hotel. He’ll be gone tomorrow. Or
Sunday at the latest.</em> The thought gave her considerable
relief.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">C</span><span class="postfirstchar">arl</span> Jensen was a clean cut young man, very fair with
freckled skin. He engaged Sarah in conversation right
away; it was a part of what he considered good technique
to get a girl talking, and he wasted no time.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Laura had dinner with them, but Jack was
obviously chafing to get away. They hadn’t even finished
their after-dinner coffee before he was whispering
in Laura’s ear, “Let’s get the hell out of here.”
Laura, who was almost wordless through dinner, agreed.
</p>

<p>
Jack did the dirty work. He told them a joke, he
made them laugh, and then he said he had a meeting
the next day up in Albany. Very unexpected. Would
they mind, etc.
</p>

<p>
They were a little startled, Jensen especially, for he
had expected Jack and Laura to stick with him and
lend moral support through the evening—but they replied,
almost together, “No, go ahead. We don’t mind.”
</p>

<p>
As soon as they were in the street Jack sighed, “God.
I couldn’t have stood another minute of it. Straight
people are so depressing.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at him and noticed for the first time
that evening how tired and worried he looked. She was
so wound up in Laura Landon that nobody’s troubles
counted for her but her own. But now she saw Jack’s anxiety
and she was afraid she had caused it. She started
to apologize. “Jack, I want you to know ...” she began.
</p>

<p>
“Skip it.”
</p>

<p>
“Please.”
</p>

<p>
“I said skip it.” And his voice was harsh enough
to hurt her.
</p>

<p>
They walked along in silence for a minute and finally
Laura said, “Jack, I have to talk. I feel awful about
it. I saw my father last night. He saw me, too. I don’t
know what came over me. I’ve never been so terrified
in my life, as if he were the devil and I had to get
<a class="pagenum" title="170" id="page-170"></a>
away from him. I ran all the way to the subway. I think
I was hysterical.”
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and then he sighed. “Everybody’s hysterical.
Even me.”
</p>

<p>
“There was an old colored lady there. In the rest room.
She said something I didn’t understand then, but I’ve
been thinking about it. She said everybody is a stranger
in this world until he finds a little love. That’s
the most important thing.”
</p>

<p>
“Wise lady,” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
They walked without talking for half a block. “How’s
Terry?” Laura asked.
</p>

<p>
“He needs a spanking. I act like a lovesick cow with
him. I can’t help it. I know I’m doing it, and I can’t
help it. He laughs at me.” Jack looked at the pavement
as he walked, his hands shoved into his pockets.
“Mother,” he said slowly. “Do you want to get back in
my good graces?”
</p>

<p>
“I do,” she said gently. “Yes. I do.”
</p>

<p>
“Well,” he said, and stopped walking. She stopped
beside him and saw that he was embarrassed. “This is
a rotten thing to do. But I’d do it for you, bear that
firmly in mind.” He poked her chest between her
breasts, as if he were making a point with a fellow
business man. It was intended to lighten the atmosphere
a little, but the atmosphere was too heavy already.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll help you, Jack, you know I will. Any way I can.
You’ve been so wonderful to me. I don’t know what I
would have done.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, okay.” He stopped her abruptly and then
seemed unable to speak himself for a minute. Finally
he said, quickly, “I’m losing him, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Jack!” She was suddenly full of sympathy, but he
cut her off again.
</p>

<p>
“What the hell,” he said cynically. “I expected it. I
<em>predicted</em> it. And I know why.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“Mother, you have a short memory.” He smiled wryly.
“My little friend likes nice things. Nice things cost
money. And besides,” he looked at his shoes, scraping
one toe along a crack in the pavement, “I can’t handle
him. I should shove his teeth down his throat. I should
<a class="pagenum" title="171" id="page-171"></a>
make him behave. And I can’t. I feel more like falling
on my knees and worshipping him. He has no respect
for me.” He spoke so softly that Laura had to strain to
hear him.
</p>

<p>
She put her hands on his arms. “Jack, he’s not worth
your time,” she said. “Anybody who would take advantage—”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, no, it’s normal. In this abnormal world we
live in, you and I. If I were young and beautiful, he’d
settle for that. But I’m not. I’m middle-aged and ugly.
And a sap. So it takes something else ... money. I wish
I had the knack of being a millionaire.”
</p>

<p>
“Damn it, Jack, you need somebody who can appreciate
you.” He laughed bitterly, but she went on. “You
make me hate Terry already without ever having seen
him.”
</p>

<p>
“No, Laura,” he said seriously. “Don’t hate him.
He’s very young. He’ll learn. It’s my fault. I can’t give
him what he needs.”
</p>

<p>
“Dollar bills?”
</p>

<p>
Jack sighed. “That’s my last chance. I know it takes
something else, but I haven’t got it. And now I haven’t
got the dollar bills, either.”
</p>

<p>
“If I were a boy I’d fall madly in love with you,”
Laura said.
</p>

<p>
This was such a startling remark that Jack had to
drop his cynicism and take it in the spirit in
which it was given. “Thanks, Mother,” he said softly.
He looked at her, his ugly intelligent face prey to a
number of strong emotions that he made no attempt to
hide. It was a measure of his regard for Laura that he
could let her see him stripped of wit and laughter like
this. “How much do you have in the bank, Laura?”
</p>

<p>
Laura stared a little at him. But then she said
quickly, “All I have is yours, Jack. It’s not much, but
if it’ll help....”
</p>

<p>
He smiled a little and then he leaned over and kissed
her cheek. “You’re a doll,” he said. “We both know this
is a losing investment. But it’ll give me a few more
days with him. After that....” He shrugged. “Well, I
always seem to live through these things. I don’t know
why.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="172" id="page-172"></a>
They stood uncertainly on the corner for a minute
and suddenly he asked, “Where are you going now?”
</p>

<p>
“Home.”
</p>

<p>
“To Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I hope Burr hasn’t tried to bother her.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s pretty sick about the whole thing. I think he’ll
drink it off for a day or two. You should, too. The
whole thing looks screwy to me.” He looked at her.
“Come have a nightcap with me.”
</p>

<p>
“Where?”
</p>

<p>
“The Cellar. Where else?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m afraid I’ll run into Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
He shrugged. “I’ve gotten to know her better.” He
gazed away from her thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
“You have?”
</p>

<p>
“She calls me all the time. ‘Where does Laura work,
what does Laura like, tell me all about her.’”
</p>

<p>
“She asked you that?” Laura was slightly incredulous,
but once again, she liked it. She was sorry she liked
it, but she did.
</p>

<p>
“Yeah. I’m beginning to think I like her.”
</p>

<p>
“You liked her before.”
</p>

<p>
“I know.” He laughed. “I’m not making sense. I guess
I mean I feel sympathetic toward her. We’re both unlucky
in love. At the moment.” He looked hard at her
then and said, “Please come with me, Laura. I don’t
want to go home.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not?”
</p>

<p>
Again he laughed, not so pleasantly this time. “I’m
afraid of what I’ll find.”
</p>

<p>
“Like what?”
</p>

<p>
“Like somebody else in my bed with Terry.”
</p>

<p>
After a moment of shocked silence, Laura put her arm
in his. “Okay,” she said. “Let’s go somewhere and flatter
the hell out of each other.”
</p>

<p>
He chuckled at her. “Mother, damn it, sometimes I
suspect you of having a sense of humor.”
</p>

<p>
They went down to The Cellar, in spite of Laura’s misgivings.
Jack seemed so unhappy that she wanted to indulge
him. It was crowded as always on Friday nights,
but Beebo wasn’t in sight.
</p>

<p>
“She’ll be in,” Jack observed. “She’s late on Fridays.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="173" id="page-173"></a>
They stood at the bar until a couple of stools were vacated
and then sat down.
</p>

<p>
“What does she do?” Laura asked rather shyly.
</p>

<p>
“Who? Beebo?”
</p>

<p>
“She must get money somewhere. She has to pay the
rent like everybody else.”
</p>

<p>
“She runs an elevator. In the Grubb Building. They
think she’s a boy.”
</p>

<p>
“My God—an <em>elevator</em>.” It seemed wrong, even ludicrous.
Beebo had too much between her ears to fritter
her youth away running an elevator. “What does she do
<em>that</em> for?”
</p>

<p>
“She doesn’t have to wear a skirt.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was stunned. It was pathetic, even shameful.
For the first time she saw Beebo not as an overwhelming,
handsome, self-assured individual, but as a very human
being with a little more pride and fear and weakness
than she ever permitted to show.
</p>

<p>
Laura didn’t know how long they had been there when
Beebo walked in. She only knew she had had plenty to
drink and it was time to go home. Beebo walked up to
her, and Laura saw her face first in the mirror. She
turned around with a start and stared at her. Beebo
was wearing a dress.
</p>

<p>
A dress. And high heeled shoes. She was over six feet
in the high heels. Strangely enough she wasn’t awkward
in them, either. She wasn’t comfortable, but she could
walk a straight line and keep her balance.
</p>

<p>
“Hello, Bo-peep,” she said quietly in Laura’s ear.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt a grateful response flow down to her toes
from the ear. “Hello,” she said to the mirror image
and then turned to face her. “Hello, Betty Jean.” She
looked at her skirt.
</p>

<p>
Beebo gave her a wry smile. “You remembered?” she
said. “Do you remember the good things, too?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Laura, smiling back. And surprised herself.
For a moment she felt curiously receptive. She had
no idea why.
</p>

<p>
Beebo gazed at her and then she put a hand on Jack’s
shoulder. “Hello, fellow sufferer,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Hi, doll.” He turned around. “We’re drowning our
sorrows.” He gestured at Laura with his glass.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="174" id="page-174"></a>
“So I see. Mind if I drown a few with you?”
</p>

<p>
“We’d be delighted.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo nodded at the bartender, who nodded back and
fixed her a whisky and water. Beebo was on good terms
with the bartenders in all the gay bars. They knew what
she drank and they served her without being told. Beebo
leaned on the counter between Jack and Laura.
</p>

<p>
“Where’ve you been, doll?” Jack asked, waving a hand
at her dress. “Masquerade ball?”
</p>

<p>
“Party,” she said laconically, hoisting her newly arrived
glass.
</p>

<p>
“Gay?”
</p>

<p>
“Straight.”
</p>

<p>
“How dull. What’s the matter with you, Beebo? You’re
no fun anymore. You wear skirts and go to straight parties.
Jesus.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo grinned at him. “I have one dress, lover. I get
it out once a year and wear it. In honor of my father.
He likes dames.”
</p>

<p>
“Yeah, but he’s not around to appreciate it.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, you are, Jackson. Give me a kiss.” And she took
his chin in her hand and extracted one from his reluctant
mouth.
</p>

<p>
“God!” he said, and made a face. Beebo laughed.
And Laura sat and watched them and wondered what
they were all doing there and why they laughed at themselves
when they were all aching inside from unspeakable
hurts. She felt vaguely jealous to think of Beebo at
a party with people she didn’t know and had never seen.
Beebo surrounded by women. Laura looked at her until
Beebo returned the stare without talking, only looking
at Laura until Laura had to lower her eyes. “What’s eating
you, Bo-peep?” Beebo said, running a finger
around the edge of her glass.
</p>

<p>
“Are pants really that important?” Laura said. She
said it sarcastically because she was afraid of her tears.
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed a little. “I don’t know. How important
is <em>that</em> important?”
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you get a decent job?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” said Beebo as she understood. She finished a
second drink. “I’ve got one, baby. I’m a lift jockey.
Very elevating work.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="175" id="page-175"></a>
“Not funny,” Laura said. “You work all day at a lousy
job like that, and then you drink all night.”
</p>

<p>
“Does that bother you?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Not very much, of course. You’re not worth it.
But it seems awful. All for a pair of pants.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed. “Reform me, baby.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t have time.”
</p>

<p>
“What do you have time for?”
</p>

<p>
“Work.”
</p>

<p>
“And Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“And Marcie.” Laura didn’t know why she said it.
She knew how badly it would hurt. But she was high,
the go-to-hell feeling was still with her from the morning.
It was either hurt or be hurt; sarcasm or tears. She
looked up slowly at Beebo. At her blue eyes and her lips
turned down, with an unaccustomed trace of lipstick
on them. Laura wanted to hurt her. She couldn’t stop herself.
She turned on her stool to face her. “You’re ridiculous,”
she said. “You’re a little girl trying to be a
little boy. And you run an elevator for the privilege.
Grow up, Beebo. You’ll never be a little boy. Or a big
boy. You just haven’t got what it takes. Not all the elevators
in the world can make a boy of you. You can wear
pants till you’re blue in the face and it won’t change
what’s underneath.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo just stared at her, her face suddenly pale and
frowning, in silence. Then she turned, leaving her cigarette
still lighted in a tray on the bar, and left them without
saying a word to either.
</p>

<p>
Laura and Jack sat in silence for a while after she had
gone, watching her cigarette burn itself out. Finally Jack
said, “If Terry had done that to me, Laura, I’d have
strangled him.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her head down on the bar and cried.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The weekend was a stalemate for Laura and Marcie.
Laura was so deeply involved in her conflicts that it was
impossible to talk about them. In two weeks Jean would
be back. In a day her father would be gone. Burr would
start hounding Marcie, and Laura still didn’t know why
Marcie had let him think they were lovers. And Beebo
... Beebo ... that hurt the worst, somehow. It was so
<a class="pagenum" title="176" id="page-176"></a>
needless, so brutal. The kind of thing Merrill Landon had
done to her when he was in a temper. Just to blow off
steam, to dissipate the mood. Only he went even farther. He
would shout and call her names, slap her, call down the
wrath of his dead wife and son on her head.
</p>

<p>
Marcie couldn’t get through to Laura, hard as she tried.
She, too, began to get moody. She launched into long
self-reproaching speeches which tortured Laura until she
begged her to stop.
</p>

<p>
On Monday Laura went to the bank before she went to
the office and withdrew one hundred and ninety-two dollars.
She was going to leave herself twenty, just in case,
but she left herself five instead. She had a little at home.
She could get along until the end of the week. The rent
wasn’t due and there was food in the house.
</p>

<p>
Jack came by at five and picked it up. “Come out for
dinner with me,” he said. “I seem to have come into a
little money.”
</p>

<p>
“No, thanks.”
</p>

<p>
“My treat,” he said, directing his sarcasm at himself
and waggling her dollars at her.
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled faintly. “Take it,” she said. “I can’t talk
to anybody tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“How’s Marcie?”
</p>

<p>
“Brooding. I get on her nerves, I guess.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s only fair. She’s made a mess of yours. How’s
Burr?”
</p>

<p>
“He called her. They talked for a few minutes. He
asked her to see him.”
</p>

<p>
“Will she?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Not yet, hm?”
</p>

<p>
“Never,” Laura said sharply. “She’s fed up with him.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, if not Burr, somebody else.” Laura covered her
face with her hands suddenly and Jack looked at her sympathetically.
“Just won’t believe me, will you, Mother!
You love Marcie so sooner or later Marcie will have to
give in and love you.”
</p>

<p>
“No!” she said, looking up. “I know it’s not that simple.
It’s just that I’m convinced I have a chance. I live with
her, I know her, and she was willing to have Burr believe
we were lovers.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="177" id="page-177"></a>
“She was willing to get him the hell out of her hair
after a bad quarrel,” he said. “That’s all. She just let
him believe it to get rid of him.”
</p>

<p>
“Please Jack,” she said with forced patience. “How’s
Terry?” <em>If he’s going to torment me, I’ll give him the
same treatment</em>, she thought.
</p>

<p>
Jack lifted his eyebrows slightly and shrugged.
“Healthy,” he said. “And hungry. Jesus, how that kid eats.
And he likes smoked oysters.”
</p>

<p>
Laura had to smile, though she didn’t feel like it. “Get
him a bale of smoked oysters,” she said, “and leave me
alone for a while. Please.”
</p>

<p>
Jack gave her shoulder a squeeze. “Okay.” He started
out and then turned to ask, “How did Sarah like Jensen?”
</p>

<p>
“She said she liked him. She has a crush on Dr. Hagstrom,
but she liked Carl anyway.”
</p>

<p>
“He’s smitten. Says he’s going to call her again.”
</p>

<p>
“Good.” They smiled a little at each other. “Somebody’s
doing it right,” Laura said wistfully.
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed. “Never mind,” he said. “Someday we’ll
die and go to heaven. All the angels are queer, you know.”
And he left.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura followed soon after. She knew just where she was
going—the McAlton Hotel. She would walk right in and
ask for Merrill Landon and the clerk would say he had
left, the convention was over, and Laura could quit suffering
over him. He would be hundreds of miles away and
she could start to forget him.
</p>

<p>
She walked over to the hotel in a matter of minutes
and went into the lobby with a confidence she had not
felt during the week her father had been there. She was
about to kill her ghost. She looked forward to great relief.
</p>

<p>
At the desk she waited for a moment or two until a
clerk could take care of her. She recognized him from one
of her previous visits but fortunately he didn’t seem to remember
her. “Yes?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Is the Chi Delta Sigma convention over?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, ma’am it is.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh. Then I guess Merrill Landon isn’t staying here
any more.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes he is.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="178" id="page-178"></a>
Laura was startled. “He said a young lady might be
asking for him,” the clerk said. “He left a message.” He
looked at her dubiously, unnerved by the strange expression
on her face. “Would you be his daughter, by any
chance?”
</p>

<p>
Laura shook her head numbly. The clerk brought her an
envelope and Laura opened it and read, in her father’s
hand: “Laura, I will be here till the end of the month.
Come up to my room any evening after eight.” It was not
even signed. <em>Nice and sentimental</em>, she thought. <em>Just like
him.</em>
</p>

<p>
“Thank you,” she told the clerk.
</p>

<p>
“Will there be any answer?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” Laura said. She took the pad of paper he pushed
toward her and wrote on it, “Go to hell.” Then she folded
it, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and wrote “Merrill
Landon” on the front.
</p>

<p>
She shook all the way home. He was still there, still
haunting her, waiting to pounce on her and punish her.
When Marcie asked her what was the matter, Laura
couldn’t tell her. It was Laura’s problem, it was intimate
and awful, and she had no wish to share it. She hardly
noticed how little she had looked at Marcie the past few
days, how little she had responded to her. And yet in the
back of her mind the question rankled: Why did Marcie
let Burr believe that lie? Even for a short while? Why
hadn’t she fought it harder?
</p>

<p>
But the fact of her father’s physical presence in New
York obliterated other considerations. He was waiting for
her around every corner, in every doorway. She was even
afraid to answer the phone, and afraid to return to his
hotel for fear he would have the police there waiting for
her. She didn’t know on what grounds he could arrest her,
but she believed her father could do anything violent and
forceful. Her work suffered still more at the office. And
she hadn’t the interest to stay late and make it up.
</p>

<p>
Sarah talked to her one afternoon at the end of the
week. “Guess what?” she said, to start out in a friendly
vein.
</p>

<p>
“What?”
</p>

<p>
“Carl Jensen called me again. We’re going out tomorrow
night.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="179" id="page-179"></a>
“How nice, Sarah. I’m glad for you.” But she spoke
without enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
“Are you?” Sarah’s voice was pointed enough to catch
Laura’s attention and warn her that something was wrong.
She looked up. “Yes, of course I am, Sarah. I’m sorry, I’m
not myself lately. I—”
</p>

<p>
“You’ve been in a fog all week. Another one of those
headaches?”
</p>

<p>
“No. I mean yes. I don’t know. I just don’t feel alive.”
She laughed listlessly.
</p>

<p>
Sarah sat down beside her. “Laura,” she said firmly,
“you could do real well in this job. If you wanted to.
Everybody here likes you. Everybody’s pulling for you.
You’re a good typist and you’re a smart girl. Jeanie liked
you a lot, and she’ll be back here in another week. There’ll
be three of us, and things could go a lot better ... but
Laura....”
</p>

<p>
“But I haven’t worked out too well,” Laura said for her.
“Is that it?”
</p>

<p>
“You haven’t worked at all sometimes. Other times
you work your tail off. That’s the trouble, Laura, you’re
so erratic,” Sarah said. “You stay late and knock yourself
out one night, and then a week goes by and you can’t do a
damn thing. You drag along all day, you just don’t seem
to care.
</p>

<p>
“I hate to pull a philosophical on you, but gee, Laura,
we’re dealing with sick people. Sometimes these X-ray reports
spell life and death for somebody. We can’t dawdle
over them. Doctors are waiting all over the city for these
things. Dr. Hollingsworth is swamped. We can’t let him
down.”
</p>

<p>
“I know.” Laura felt the way she had in third grade
when she feigned sick to get out of playing a role in the
annual spring pageant. The teacher had talked to her in
much the same tone of voice, and used much the same
arguments. “Everybody’s pulling for you, we all like you,
don’t let us down, Laura, don’t let us down.” But the
thought of going out on that stage had appalled her. The
whole audience melted down to one man—Merrill Landon.
She had done it, finally, to prove she could. But his
amused criticisms afterward had nearly killed her.
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t been feeling well,” she murmured to Sarah.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="180" id="page-180"></a>
“Well, you’d better start feeling better, honey. Because
Dr. Hollingsworth and I had a little talk today. He asked
me what was wrong with you. He thought maybe if you
and I talked it over you might tell me what was the matter.”
She spoke carefully, in a discreet voice.
</p>

<p>
But Laura stood up, offended and frightened. “Nothing’s
the matter,” she snapped. “If he doesn’t like my
work let him come to me and tell me about it himself.”
</p>

<p>
Sarah stood up, herself slightly offended at this display
of ingratitude. “He came to me because he wanted to
spare you any embarrassment, Laura. I should think that
would be obvious.”
</p>

<p>
Laura relented a little. “I’m sorry, Sarah. I can’t explain
it. I just can’t, it’s impossible. If he wants to let me go, I
have no choice. I’ll leave.” But she was not as resigned to
it, as stoical, as she sounded.
</p>

<p>
“Can’t you <em>try</em> to do a little better, Laura?” Sarah said
kindly. “If I could tell him we had a little talk and you
promised to try to do better. Or you’d been sick, or had a
problem at home, or something. <em>Anything.</em>”
</p>

<p>
Laura gave an unpleasant little laugh. Then her face
dropped and she said, “I have no excuses, Sarah. I’m not a
good enough liar to cook one up. I just—” And here she
burst unexpectedly into tears and Sarah had to try to comfort
her.
</p>

<p>
“Look, honey,” she said, after Laura had recovered a
little. “Do you want the job? Do you?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” Laura said. “I want it.”
</p>

<p>
“Will you try to be more consistent, then? And I’ll tell
Dr. Hollingsworth you’ve been having trouble at home
you don’t want to talk about.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s such an obvious fib, Sarah.”
</p>

<p>
“No, it’s no fib. I heard you talk to Jack on the phone
last week,” Sarah said. “I know there’s something going
on.”
</p>

<p>
Laura went shaky and pale, and the blue shadows that
had been growing in the past weeks under her eyes deepened.
“What do you know?” she demanded.
</p>

<p>
Sarah became alarmed at her appearance. “Well, nothing
really, only you sounded so upset, I thought maybe—”
</p>

<p>
“What did I say?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t remember.” She tried to push it off casually,
<a class="pagenum" title="181" id="page-181"></a>
but she had thoroughly scared Laura, who recalled
with biting clarity now Jack’s voice saying, <em>For God’s
sake, Mother, keep your voice down</em>. “What did I say,
Sarah?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing so very bad, Laura.” Sarah stared at her. “I
just got the impression you had a quarrel.”
</p>

<p>
“You had no right to listen!” Laura exclaimed harshly.
</p>

<p>
“You had no right to make personal calls during working
hours, for that matter,” Sarah said defensively.
</p>

<p>
Laura picked up her purse and ran out of the office
without another word. She went into a phone booth and
called Jack. “Can I come over?” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No. I’m in a mess.”
</p>

<p>
“Please, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Mother, for Christ’s sake! Be empathic for once, will
you?”
</p>

<p>
“All right, I’ll call Beebo.”
</p>

<p>
“No don’t. She’s p.o.’d at you. She may never speak to
you again after what you said to her.”
</p>

<p>
Laura felt frantic. “Well, what am I supposed to do?”
she said, half crying into the receiver. “I’ve practically lost
my job.”
</p>

<p>
“Go home to Marcie, Mother. Do <em>something</em>. I can’t
help you out tonight. I’m sorry, honey.” And he was.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Jack, say something to me. Say something kind.
Anything.”
</p>

<p>
After a pause he said, “I love you, Mother. Only I’m
not <em>in</em> love with you. I wish to hell I was, it couldn’t be
worse than Terry. Now be a doll and let me go. I’ll call
you tomorrow.”
</p>

<p>
She felt the urgency to get away in his voice and let him
go. For a moment she sat in the booth and dried her tears.
She felt sick about Beebo but she was afraid to call her.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was another torturous weekend for Marcie, who was
beginning to feel as if she had ruined Laura’s life. It was
Sunday night before they actually made any sort of communication
with each other.
</p>

<p>
Burr had been calling Marcie every night, trying to talk
her into leaving the apartment. Their talks were short but
the animosity had faded from them. Laura listened to
them listlessly; she could not avoid hearing them in the
<a class="pagenum" title="182" id="page-182"></a>
small apartment. Marcie said things like, “Yes, she’s here.”
“No, you <em>know</em> I don’t want to see you.” “No, we aren’t,
and don’t bring that up again.” “I know I did. I know
what I did, Burr, don’t throw it in my face.” She refused
to see him.
</p>

<p>
Laura winced at all this, and finally she took to going
out on the roof when he called. The windows were wide
open, the weather being soft and pleasant now, and
Marcie’s voice carried even out there. But it wasn’t so
pervading, so persistent. On Sunday night, Laura went out
and looked at the city while Marcie talked. The time
passed almost without Laura’s being aware of it. She gazed
across New York in the direction of the McAlton, wondering
if her father was sitting in his room waiting for
her. And then she looked down toward the Village and
her heart gave a sick squeeze at the thought of Beebo.
Beebo, who told her how terribly a love affair could hurt.
Beebo, who told her to beware and then got caught in her
own trap. Laura wondered if Beebo really loved her. If
she could ever forgive her. Laura had attacked the very
basis of her being: her body, her pride, her deepest needs.
In that one quick wicked speech, Laura had ridiculed
her. She felt the tears come. And she could hear Jack saying,
“If Terry said that to me, I’d strangle him.” It was
shameful.
</p>

<p>
She grew very depressed, thinking of the necessity of
going back to work in the office the next morning, with
Sarah trying to put on cheerfulness and Dr. Hollingsworth—so
kindly, so tolerant—watching for signs of steadiness
and application in her. And herself, so heavily aware
of their good will toward her, their frustration, and her
own overwhelming complexities that sapped her strength
and effort.
</p>

<p>
She was startled when Marcie said at her elbow, “Burr
wants to see me.” When Laura didn’t answer, Marcie said,
“He feels God-awful about the whole thing. He wants to
apologize to me.” Another silence. “I want to apologize
to <em>you</em>, Laura. But you won’t let me.”
</p>

<p>
Laura shut her eyes in pain for a moment, as if to avoid
the sight of Marcie’s face. And then she opened them and
without looking at her, said, “We’ve been all through this
before, Marcie. I don’t want your apologies. You have
nothing to apologize for.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="183" id="page-183"></a>
“I do.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t!”
</p>

<p>
Marcie gave a long sigh of exasperation. “All right,
then why won’t you speak to me?”
</p>

<p>
“I <em>will</em>, Marcie. When I can.”
</p>

<p>
“When will that be?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not now?”
</p>

<p>
“I guess I’m sick. Maybe Jack was right, I need to see
his analyst.” She tried to smile a little.
</p>

<p>
“Because of your father? What he did to you?”
</p>

<p>
Laura looked down at her arms, folded on the cement
railing. “I guess so,” she almost whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Laura, say something to me. This is unbearable.” Marcie
was pleading with her, as Laura had pleaded herself
with Jack on the phone. She turned and looked at Marcie,
standing close beside her, two delicate lines between her
eyes betraying the tension inside her. For a moment Laura
just looked at her. It had been over a week since she
looked at Marcie that way. In the soft spring night, in the
golden light fading up from the streets below, with the
myriad muffled noises that are the music of a great city
around them, they gazed at each other. And Marcie was
very beautiful with her hair lifted gently in the breeze
and her eyes big with anxiety. She was wrapped in a blue
silk negligee and the lines of her slim young body showed
through it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, prompted by the necessity to speak, Laura said,
“It’s so hard to talk, Marcie. Words are so inadequate
sometimes.”
</p>

<p>
“Any words will do, Laura. Except ‘Excuse me.’ That’s
all you’ve said to me for days on end.”
</p>

<p>
They smiled a little at each other, and Laura took her
hands. She pulled just a little on them, and Marcie responded
softly, coming toward her. “Laura, tell me I’m
forgiven. Don’t say there’s nothing to forgive me for. I
just want to hear you say it.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Please.” Her voice broke.
</p>

<p>
“No, no, no,” Laura said, gazing curiously at Marcie.
Did she really feel so guilty? She hadn’t done anything that
bad. Laura had a strange feeling of finality, of the end of
things, of everything ending at once so that nothing really
<a class="pagenum" title="184" id="page-184"></a>
mattered any more. As if Marcie would turn and walk
out of her life, and her job would end, and Beebo would
never see her, and Jack and Terry would break up. It made
her pensive and sad. She wondered at all the new feelings
in her: the inability to care about her job, her meanness
with Beebo, her unreasoning fear of Merrill Landon in the
hotel lobby. Nothing seemed very real, up there on the
roof. It didn’t seem to make much difference what she
did. She gave another little pull and Marcie came still
closer, touching her up and down the length of her body.
</p>

<p>
Laura touched her hair. “You look so much like a
friend of mine,” she said. Marcie reminded her of
Beth again at this moment; the Beth she had lost so long
ago, a million years ago, it seemed.
</p>

<p>
“I do? You never told me that.”
</p>

<p>
“I forgot.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s she like?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, she was tall, short dark hair, purple eyes. Rather
boyish.”
</p>

<p>
“You talk about her as if she were dead.”
</p>

<p>
“She is. As far as I’m concerned.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie frowned at her. “She doesn’t sound at all like
me.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I guess she doesn’t,” Laura said. “There’s something
about your face; I don’t know how to define it.
I thought I saw a resemblance.” She had seen it in
Beebo, too. And even in the curly-headed little blonde
who had approached her in The Cellar the night she
was looking for Beebo. They couldn’t all look like Beth.
It was very strange.
</p>

<p>
“Were you good friends?” Marcie asked.
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled a little and put her arms around Marcie.
In the still night she answered simply, “We were
lovers.” It was very quiet, dreamlike, as if she spoke
in a trance.
</p>

<p>
Marcie stared at her, motionless, as if to determine
whether she were joking. She stood in Laura’s arms, unable
to move one way or the other; uncertain and a little
scared.
</p>

<p>
Laura saw her consternation, but it didn’t worry her.
She spoke again, still feeling as if it weren’t real, any more
than the glittering city below was real, or her father’s
<a class="pagenum" title="185" id="page-185"></a>
wrath, or Jack, or Beebo, or the doctors and Sarah ...
“That was the ‘great love’ I told you about, in college,”
she said. “It was Beth.”
</p>

<p>
After a long pause, Marcie said in a whisper,
“What happened?”
</p>

<p>
“She got married,” Laura said.
</p>

<p>
Marcie was dumbfounded. “I’m sorry,” she said awkwardly
and then retreated into herself, embarrassed. She
had no idea what to say, what to do.
</p>

<p>
Laura could see that, but at first she didn’t try to interpret
it. It didn’t frighten her yet. “That’s why I
was so shocked when Burr said you told him we were
lovers,” Laura said. “I wish we were, Marcie. But I
never touched you.” Marcie was studying her now, her
eyes brimming. “When he accused me of it and believed
it and said you told him so, I was so hurt I
didn’t know what to do or say. I thought of a million
crazy explanations. The only one that seemed to make
sense was that you felt the way I do.” She looked hard at
Marcie. Their faces were very close together, and Laura
was holding her tightly, her arms locked around Marcie’s
small waist. “Do you, Marcie?” Laura whispered.
“Do you?”
</p>

<p>
They stayed that way for awhile, not moving, looking
at each other. Laura felt her breath speed up and she
felt a powerful longing to kiss Marcie. It grew stronger
by the second. She began to press Marcie against her
rhythmically and suddenly all the months of repression
exploded inside her and came out kisses on her lips.
She began to kiss Marcie intensely—her face, her neck
and arms, her ears, her throat. “Marcie,” she said
hoarsely, suddenly holding her tight with the strength
of desire. “I’ve wanted you for so long. I thought I’d die
of it. Living with you, so close to you, seeing you all
the time ... undressing, bathing ... It drove me crazy.
Marcie, you’re so beautiful, so sweet. Oh, God, it feels
so good to say it. You’re impossible. I want you so terribly,
so terribly. You want me too, don’t you? I know it,
I always knew it. Oh, Marcie, let me, let me. Don’t
stop me! Please!” A note of anguish crept into her voice
when Marcie began to resist her. “Please, Marcie!” she
implored her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="186" id="page-186"></a>
But Marcie put her arms up and pushed hard against
Laura. “Let me go!” she said. “Let me go!” And she
began to cry. Laura, shocked, released her so suddenly
that Marcie staggered backwards a little. She gave a cry,
recovered her balance, and stared at Laura with her
eyes wide for a moment. Then she turned and ran inside.
</p>

<p>
Laura stood where she was for a long time, afraid to
think or feel. She had no idea how much time had passed
before she dared to go inside. Had she frightened Marcie?
Revolted her? Would Marcie greet her with love
or hatred? As a witch or a lover? She was in a state of
nervous agony when she finally gathered the strength to
walk around to the penthouse door.
</p>

<p>
She opened it and walked slowly through the living
room and kitchen. She pushed the bedroom door open
slowly. Marcie was sitting on her bed, her back toward
Laura. She had apparently sat like that without moving
for some time. She turned very slowly when she heard
Laura come in, and looked up at her. Laura felt her
heart turn over. Marcie was so lovely, so miserable. It
showed plainly in her face. Laura went to her and
dropped to her knees in front of her and put her head in
Marcie’s lap. And when she felt Marcie’s hand stroking
her head, she wept.
</p>

<p>
“Forgive me,” she begged. “It’s your turn now, Marcie.
I frightened you. I didn’t mean to, I didn’t!”
And she caught Marcie’s hand and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” Marcie said quietly. “I’ve been trying to
talk to you for weeks and you wouldn’t let me. Now it’s
eating me up. I’m going to tell you something. And
you’re going to listen.” Her voice trembled so that Laura
looked up at her.
</p>

<p>
“Laura, I’m so ashamed, so ashamed.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, Marcie. Tell me. I’m listening now.” She
searched her face anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Marcie swallowed her tears and with a tremendous
effort, said, “I did an awful thing, Laur. I’ve known
for a while about you.” She looked away, struggling
with herself; her shame, her pity, her shaking voice.
</p>

<p>
“You—you knew?” Laura whispered, going white.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I couldn’t help knowing. You couldn’t hide it,
Laura. You couldn’t come near me without it showing—in
<a class="pagenum" title="187" id="page-187"></a>
your eyes, your face. The way you touched me, the
things you said, all the crazy moods you had. You
seemed afraid of me. You let things slip. You even
kissed me once. I’ve been around enough to know. I
knew about you.” She wiped the tears from her cheeks
embarrassedly and went on, unable to look at Laura, “I
should have told you. Or else I should have let it drop.
But I guess it interested me. It seemed like a game. I
got sort of intrigued, you might say. I even told Burr
what I suspected ... months ago ...” She stifled a sob.
</p>

<p>
Laura’s face was colorless, tortured. Her hands were
over her mouth.
</p>

<p>
“It kills me to say these things,” Marcie whispered.
“But I did everything to earn your contempt. I can’t lie
to you any more, Laura. I even <em>bet</em> Burr I could make
you make a pass at me.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” Laura gasped. “Oh, no—”
</p>

<p>
“He thought it was all a joke. He wouldn’t even listen
to me. Until I got fed up with him and started
hanging around here so much. Then he got it into his
head that we were having a hot and heavy affair. I
couldn’t talk him out of it. I’d gone too far for that.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned away from her and rested her head
against her own bed, too stunned, too wounded, to answer
or understand half of it.
</p>

<p>
“Laura.” Marcie bent toward her. “I don’t know what
crazy imp gets hold of me sometimes. I swear I don’t. I
never even wondered what I’d do if it ever came to
this, if you ever tried to make love to me. I guess I
thought it would be a game, like everything else. I guess
I thought it would be a lot of kicks. Or just a stupid
silly thing that wouldn’t really matter. To either of us.
I guess I didn’t think at all.
</p>

<p>
“And just now—on the roof—when you told me how
you felt, and how you wanted me—Laura, I had no idea
you could love like that. I didn’t know it could be
beautiful, or touching, or tragic. I thought it was
mostly play-acting. I thought the only real love was between
men and women. But you made it beautiful,
Laura. I don’t know what else to call it. I’m ashamed.
Clear through my soul. I played you for a fool, and all
the while you were an angel.”
</p>

<p>
Laura began to sob.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="188" id="page-188"></a>
“I’d do anything for you, Laur,” Marcie whispered.
“Anything to make it up. If I could love you the way
you want me to, I’d do that. I’ll even try, if you want it.”
</p>

<p>
Laura slumped to the floor, her arms over her head, and
sobbed helplessly.
</p>

<p>
Marcie knelt beside her, profoundly afraid and
ashamed. “Laura,” she said, “Do whatever you want
with me. I’ve hurt you so terribly. Hurt me back if it’ll
help. Do something. Do anything. I can’t stand to see
you like this. Oh, Laura, Laura. Please don’t cry like
that. Please.”

Chapter Fourteen
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> the morning—the bleak morning that came in
spite of everything and had to be faced—she could
hardly look at Marcie. And Marcie, brimming with
shame and pity, avoided her, breaking softly into tears
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast Marcie said, “Laur, if you think you can
bear to live with me I don’t want you to move out. Nothing
was your fault, nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t stand it, Marcie,” Laura said hoarsely
without looking at her. “Neither could you.” She got
up abruptly and left the table without having eaten a
thing.
</p>

<p>
Marcie got up and followed her. “I wish we could
still be friends, Laur.”
</p>

<p>
“We never were.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, but we were. I like you so much, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, this is unbearable. Don’t talk to me. Please
don’t.”
</p>

<p>
“But I can’t just leave things like this, it’s too
awful.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t help it.”
</p>

<p>
“Laura, I’ll never get over this. I’ll never forgive myself.
I hurt you so.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie, stop it!” She almost screamed at her. “I
was a fool, a blind fool. I wouldn’t listen.” She was
thinking of all the warnings from Jack and Beebo that
she willfully ignored. But she caught herself and spared
Jack another betrayal. That, at least, was something Marcie
didn’t know and never would. “Never mind,” she
finished. “Just drop it.” She turned away and busied
herself, but Marcie wouldn’t let her go.
</p>

<p>
“You will come back tonight, won’t you, Laura?
You’ll stay here until you find another place? I’ll be
sick if you don’t. This is your apartment as much as
it is mine. I’ll move out if you’d rather. You know
<a class="pagenum" title="190" id="page-190"></a>
that, don’t you, Laur?” She was so anxious, so eager for
conciliation, so disgusted with what she had done,
that Laura felt a momentary relenting and looked shyly
at her. “Please come back tonight,” Marcie whispered.
“I’ll worry myself sick if you don’t. Please. Promise?”
</p>

<p>
Laura shut her eyes for a moment and tried to control
her voice. She hadn’t the courage to argue. She just said,
“Yes,” and grabbed her purse and rushed out.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura knew, even before she reached the subway, that
she wasn’t going to work that day. She knew it would be
impossible for her to read, to type, to look up words, to
answer the doctors, to joke with Sarah. It would be a
nightmare of hypocrisy, utterly beyond her strength.
</p>

<p>
She felt shattered, ready to scream if anyone touched
her, like someone with an open wound. But she held
herself tightly in check. She rode aimlessly on the subway
for an hour or two. She stood in bookshops with a volume
in her hands and stared at the pages until the
clerks, in turn, stared at her. She sat on benches in Central
Park. She stopped now and then to get a cup of coffee,
and late in the day, a sandwich. It enabled her to
keep walking. She walked, looking at nothing but the
pavement ahead of her, for a couple of hours. She paid
no attention to where she was going or why. She walked
to exhaust herself, to reach that country of fatigue where
even the mind cannot operate and the emotions are
dead.
</p>

<p>
Abruptly she found herself standing outside the McAlton
in the last hour of daylight. She was not strong
enough to feel surprise. On the contrary, it was as if
she had been working toward it, all through that empty
endless day, knowing she would end up here. And knowing,
she had not needed to think of it, to make a decision.
It was unavoidable.
</p>

<p>
She stood outside the main door to the lobby, looking
at the people hurrying past and hoping somebody
would come up to her, talk to her, even make advances to
her. Anything to postpone what she knew was coming.
She looked at the door and away again, and then back to
it, as if it were a great sinister magnet. Sooner or later
she knew she would walk through it.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="191" id="page-191"></a>
She stood leaning against the gray stone of the McAlton,
her fine face pale and vacant, her body apparently
relaxed. She looked like a tired young career girl,
waiting at the appointed place for a date. She knew it
and took advantage of it. The hotel doorman strolled
over to her and said, “Lovely evening, isn’t it?” And
later, “Looks like he’s a bit late, Miss.” With a little
smile.
</p>

<p>
Laura returned the smile faintly. She tried to engage
him in conversation, but he was called away frequently,
and finally, with the evening crowd converging
on him, got too busy to talk to her at all. The night
was violet now, turning fast to black. It was eight o’clock.
</p>

<p>
Laura turned to the door and walked through it almost
automatically. Once inside she was suddenly profoundly
afraid. Flashes of fear went through her; long
sweeps of tremors and gooseflesh. She didn’t bother with
the desk this time. She knew what floor he was on. She
got the elevator and said, “Fourteenth floor, please.” She
wondered if her voice sounded as shaky as it felt in
her throat. She thought of simply getting off the elevator
on the fourteenth floor and taking another elevator
right back down. And when she was let off, she stood
there in the deep carpeted hall with her heart crying
“No-no, no-no, no-no,” at every beat.
</p>

<p>
“He’s my father,” she told herself. “He won’t kill me,
after all. He might beat me, but he’s done that before
and I’ve lived through it. I’ll be twenty-one in three
weeks, so he can’t say I’m a minor. All he can do is
make a speech about my ungratefulness. He’s a human
being, not the devil.” She said the last aloud, in a
whisper, and her own voice startled her.
</p>

<p>
Cautiously, Laura investigated room numbers, half
expecting him to burst from his room and discover
her unprepared. After a few false starts she found 1402
and standing there, looking at that door, she felt an
enormous need to cry. She shut her eyes hard and said
softly, “I won’t, I won’t.” Then she opened them, and,
with her heart in her mouth, she rapped on the door.
</p>

<p>
The noise sounded huge. For a moment she wanted
to run. But she didn’t. <em>He mustn’t see me looking panicky</em>,
she thought. She listened. There was no sound audible.
<a class="pagenum" title="192" id="page-192"></a>
<em>Maybe he’s not in. Oh, dear God, maybe he left.</em>
She didn’t know whether to exult or despair. <em>If I don’t
face him now, I’ll never be able to face myself</em>, she
thought. <em>I’ll never stand alone. I’ve got to tell him everything.</em>
She felt desperate at the thought of having to go
and search him out, to win her freedom from him. The
hope that she had missed him, that he had already left
for Chicago, was too sweet to banish.
</p>

<p>
She was ready to flee when the door swung open, without
any preliminary sounds to warn her. She blanched
uncontrollably and found herself looking at her father’s
feet. Very slowly, she looked up the rest of him to his
face. There was a slight frown on his heavy features.
But he wasn’t at all surprised. He let her stand there until
she was miserably uncomfortable, and then—only then—he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
“Come in,” he said. Not “Hello, Laura.” He spoke as
if she might have been the maid come to clean his
room. He stepped aside slightly to permit her to walk
past him. She clutched herself in her arms, fearful of
touching him as she brushed past, and walked quickly
across the room to a half open window on the opposite
side. She looked resolutely out at the city, afraid to let
him see her face.
</p>

<p>
<em>The minute I look at him, I’ll cry. I’ll do some damn
silly weak thing, and he’ll lord it over me, and I’ll wind
up promising to go home to Chicago with him. I
can’t look at him. Not yet.</em>
</p>

<p>
She listened to him moving around the room behind
her and felt his eyes on her. But he said nothing. After
a few moments, Laura could stand it no longer. She knew
he was laughing at her. Not with his voice or his
lips, but silently, inside. She turned and looked for
him. He was standing across the room, his enormous
back planted against the wall, his arms folded over his
chest, studying her. She flinched a little, seeing his
face.
</p>

<p>
“I never knew before,” he said slowly, savoring it,
“how fast you could run.” He gave her a slight sardonic
smile.
</p>

<p>
Laura felt her insides turn to water. Her face was
white and set as plaster. She forced herself to return his
gaze.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="193" id="page-193"></a>
“I never knew you could swear, either,” he said. “Especially
at me. As a matter of fact, I doubt whether you
can, now that we’re face to face.”
</p>

<p>
It was a dare. Laura, stung, felt a flush of resistance
come up in her. “If I do,” she said, “you’ll beat me.
That’s your answer to everything.”
</p>

<p>
“It always worked before,” he said, mocking her.
</p>

<p>
“It worked so well that it drove me out of your house
forever. It made me hate you, Father.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t need to spell it for me, Laura. I get the
idea.”
</p>

<p>
She hated his sarcasm! Her hatred flowed in her now
and revived her spirit. “Is that what you wanted? To
make me hate you?” she asked. “Because you’ve done a
fine job. A masterful job.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks. I’m glad we agree on one thing anyway.” He
stood immovable, still smiling slightly.
</p>

<p>
<em>He wants to drive me frantic. He wants me to end up
on my knees, incoherent. Kissing his feet. God damn
him! He doesn’t care what he says as long as it’ll drive
me wild.</em>
</p>

<p>
“I must say, you took a prosaic way out, Laura. Running
away is no way to solve a problem. Running away
to New York is the classic cliché. There are a lot of
you here in New York, you know. Silly little girls who
left one set of problems at home for another set in the
big city.”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned her back on him. <em>I won’t even answer
him. If I could just hurt him somehow. Hurt him like
he hurts me. What would hurt him the worst? Mother.
My Mother.</em>
</p>

<p>
“Did you slap my mother around the way you do me?”
she asked him abruptly.
</p>

<p>
At this his smile faded and his face grew very hard.
“Your mother never deserved it,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Neither did I,” she retorted. “As far as I can see.”
</p>

<p>
“You are notoriously shortsighted, my darling daughter.”
</p>

<p>
“And you, Father, are blind.” Her face flushed.
</p>

<p>
Again he smiled, but his smile frightened her. “What
have you been doing, Laura, that gives you such intestinal
fortitude in the face of such obvious physical risk?”
</p>

<p>
She wanted to scream at him, “I hate you! I hate your
<a class="pagenum" title="194" id="page-194"></a>
God-damn sophisticated sarcasm!” But she only said
tersely, “I have a job. I have some nice friends. I have
money in the bank. I have a life of my own without
you. I have a little confidence I never had before.” They
were all lies, that started out so beautifully true. Almost
all lies, anyway. But she had flung them in his face,
and now he was not sure. He studied her. “Those are
the problems I came to face in New York, Father. Nothing
could ever persuade me to trade them for the ones
at home.” <em>If I didn’t hate him so much I couldn’t do it.
He started out wrong, trying to drive me in a corner.
He gave me a chance without realizing it.</em>
</p>

<p>
He moved away from the wall then, his face registering
contemptuous amusement. He lighted a cigarette,
and, to her astonishment, offered her one. She shook
her head. “Well,” he observed. “You apparently haven’t
taken up all the vices yet.” He turned away from her and
walked about the room, firing questions at her. “What
kind of job do you have?”
</p>

<p>
“Medical secretary.”
</p>

<p>
“Where?”
</p>

<p>
“With Dr. Edgar Hollingsworth.”
</p>

<p>
“Who’s he?”
</p>

<p>
“The top radiologist in the city.”
</p>

<p>
“Where’s his office?”
</p>

<p>
“Fifth and fifty-third.”
</p>

<p>
“Who are the friends?”
</p>

<p>
This abrupt switch threw her for a moment. “The
friends?”
</p>

<p>
“You said you had some.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” she said quickly. “Do you want their names?”
The little sarcasms she mustered added to her bravery.
</p>

<p>
He curled his mouth disgustedly. “Anything that will
help,” he said. “Names mean nothing. Who are they?”
</p>

<p>
“Well,” she said, “some are men and some are women.”
</p>

<p>
For a triumphant moment she felt like laughing in his
face. But his face had grown dark, and a flash of fear
prevented her. “My roommate,” she went on, more timidly.
“For one. She’s a very nice girl, I’ve met a lot of wonderful
people through her. The doctors have been wonderful
to me.”
</p>

<p>
“Everybody’s ‘wonderful’,” he mimicked.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="195" id="page-195"></a>
“I was surprised to find that people can be nice,
Father.”
</p>

<p>
“God! If a man accused me of being ‘nice’ I’d spit in
his face.”
</p>

<p>
“And decent and human!” she said hotly.
</p>

<p>
His face grew dangerous now and his body tense. “Are
you implying that I’m not human?”
</p>

<p>
Her fear grew suddenly quite strong and for a moment
she wavered. Then she said softly, “If you’re going to
beat me, Father, do it now and let’s get it over with.”
</p>

<p>
He laughed; an awful laugh she remembered very well.
It was usually the prelude to violence. “Well, isn’t that
noble,” he said. “Why don’t you pull down your pants
and bend over? Make it easy for me?”
</p>

<p>
“You’ve beaten me all my life, whenever I displeased
you. And I seem to displease you just by existing. I’ve
never seen you beat anyone your own size, Father, but
you’re awfully damn good at beating <em>me</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“My, aren’t we grown up!” he said. “We not only talk
back to our Father now, we swear at him. That’s real
sophistication.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t know how much I hate you, Father! You
can’t know! I’ve begun to think that’s what you want.
You’ve worked hard enough all my life to make me hate
you.”
</p>

<p>
His face changed again, became grave and heavy. Her
eyes watched him intently, like eyes that have witnessed
floods scan the skies for sun. He turned away from her,
dragging on his cigarette, knocking ashes into a heavy
glass tray on the dresser. “Why do you hate me, Laura?”
he asked dispassionately. “Because I discipline you now
and then? Isn’t that a father’s prerogative?”
</p>

<p>
“Not when it ruins his child’s life.”
</p>

<p>
“Is your life ruined?” he said sharply. “You have a
‘wonderful’ job, ‘wonderful’ friends. Wonderful money in
the bank, wonderful everything. Hell, I seem to have done
you a favor.”
</p>

<p>
“A favor! You call it a favor!” She stared at him, his
hardness still astonishing her after all these years. And
then she felt her resistance begin to wilt. Sooner or later
all her arguments were doomed. She never won with him.
The sheer physical fact of him, massive and dominant, exhausted
<a class="pagenum" title="196" id="page-196"></a>
her after a while. “I—I never wanted to hate
you, Father. You were all I had. I wanted to love you. But
you wouldn’t let me,” she almost whispered. <em>I mustn’t go
on like this. I’ll cry</em>, she thought desperately. “I hate you
because you hate me!” she flung at him.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her for some time before he answered
quietly, “What makes you think I hate you, Laura?”
</p>

<p>
She was so taken aback by this that she could only stammer
at him. “I don’t know, but you know you do.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, come now. I haven’t been <em>that</em> harsh with you.”
</p>

<p>
<em>It’s a trap! A trap! He wants to soften me up. He wants
to see me whimpering. Oh, God, if only I could stop him,
freeze him up, like other men.</em> “You’ve been brutal,” she
said harshly and the sobs were crowding close in her
throat. “You’ve treated me like a slave. Worse! you’ve
beaten me sometimes for nothing. Just for the exercise.”
</p>

<p>
“I never once beat you without a reason,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“You lie!” And her voice was a furious hiss.
</p>

<p>
He glared at her. “I’m not in the habit of lying to you,
Laura. Your life has been more than beatings. I sent you
to the best schools. I let you go to the college of your
choice. I let you join a sorority and paid all your bills. And
when you came home and quit like a damn coward—without
so much as an explanation, I didn’t force you to
go back. I found you a good job with excellent training
and a big future. I’ve given you a good comfortable home,
a lot of clothes, travel.” His voice was low, controlled,
but it was the calm before the storm and he was tense.
</p>

<p>
“I would have traded them all for love.” Her voice broke
and she turned suddenly away, afraid to shame herself
with tears in front of him.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s not get maudlin,” he said sardonically, and once
again smothered the spark of tenderness that had waited
so many years in Laura for expression.
</p>

<p>
“All right,” she said sharply. “Let’s not be maudlin. I
have a good job here and I’m not going to leave New
York. That’s what I came to tell you. Now maybe I’ll better
go.” She turned and walked resolutely toward the door,
but she should have known it wouldn’t be that easy. He
merely placed himself between the door and Laura and
she stopped, afraid to go near him. He smiled slightly at
this evidence of his power over her.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="197" id="page-197"></a>
“Before you leave,” he said, “suppose you explain the
filial affection that made you write me to go to hell, in
your little billet-doux last week?”
</p>

<p>
“Why did you say you had no daughter?” she flared.
</p>

<p>
“To teach you a lesson.”
</p>

<p>
“Are there any lessons left for you to teach me?” she
said.
</p>

<p>
“Quite a few, my dear. You don’t know it all yet, even
if you are almost twenty-one.”
</p>

<p>
“It almost killed me, Father,” she said, the anguish
showing. “You don’t know how terribly I—” But she
stopped herself, ashamed. He didn’t know, and she didn’t
want him to know. She was the one who cared about their
relationship, who wanted love and trust and gentleness
between them. Not her father. He didn’t give a damn, as
long as she minded him. “You said you had no daughter,”
she repeated bitterly.
</p>

<p>
“You wanted it that way, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
She turned to stare at him, incredulous. “I?” She said.
“<em>I</em> wanted it that way?”
</p>

<p>
“You denied my existence before I ever denied yours,”
he said. “You ran away from me.”
</p>

<p>
“You <em>forced</em> me to.”
</p>

<p>
“I did no such thing.”
</p>

<p>
“You made life intolerable for me.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t mean to.” It was an extraordinary admission,
completely unexpected, and she looked at him speechless
for a moment.
</p>

<p>
“Then why didn’t you show me some kindness?” she
said. “Just a very little would have gone a long way,
Father.”
</p>

<p>
He crushed out his cigarette in the heavy ashtray with
an expression of contempt on his face, “You women are
all alike, I swear to God.” he said. “Give you a little and
you demand a lot.”
</p>

<p>
“What’s wrong with a lot?” she said, trembling. “You’re
my father.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, exactly!” he said, so roughly that she ducked.
“I’m your father!”
</p>

<p>
“Did you treat my mother this way?” she whispered.
“Her life must have been hell.”
</p>

<p>
He looked for a minute as if he would strangle her. She
<a class="pagenum" title="198" id="page-198"></a>
stood her ground, pale and frightened, until he relented
suddenly and turned his profile to her, looking out the
window. “Your mother,” he said painfully, “was my wife.
I adored her.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was absolutely unable to answer him. She sat
down weakly in the stuffed chair by the dresser and put
her face in her hands. Her father—her enormous gruff
harsh father—had never spoken such a tender word in
her presence in all her life.
</p>

<p>
“I could never marry again, when she died,” he said.
Laura felt frightened as she always did when her mother’s
death was mentioned. She expected him to turn on her
unreasonably as he had so often before. “I never struck
her.”
</p>

<p>
“Then why me?” she implored out of a dry throat.
</p>

<p>
He turned and looked at her, his mouth twisted a little,
running a distraught hand through his hair. “You needed
it,” was all he would say.
</p>

<p>
“What for?”
</p>

<p>
“You <em>needed</em> it, that’s what for!” And she was afraid to
push him further. After some minutes he said, “Laura,
you’re coming back to Chicago with me.”
</p>

<p>
“No Father, I can’t. I won’t.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s why I waited for you,” he went on, as if she had
said nothing.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t go to Chicago or anywhere else with you. I’m
through with you.”
</p>

<p>
“You could look for work with a radiologist, if you like
it so well. I won’t insist on journalism. You have a flair
for it, it’s a waste to leave the field, but I won’t insist.
You see, Laura, I can be human enough.”
</p>

<p>
She stared at him. She had never heard him talk like
this. He glanced at her, annoyed by the look on her face.
“I’ve made reservations,” he said, “for June first. That’s
Saturday. I could probably get earlier ones.”
</p>

<p>
“Father.” She stood up. “I can’t come with you.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t say that!” he commanded her, so sharply that
she started.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“You can, and you will. That’s all I want to hear on
the subject.” As she started once again to protest he held
his hands up for silence. “No more discipline Laura. I
<a class="pagenum" title="199" id="page-199"></a>
promise you that. I was a fool. You were too, but never
mind that now. I was too hard on you, it’s true. I see that.
Well, you’re more or less grown up by this time. I guess
we can dispense with spanking.”
</p>

<p>
“Spanking! It was more than that and you know it!”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t argue with me, Laura.” He turned on her, his
voice low and fierce. Then, making a visible effort to
calm himself, he said, “Get your things together and I’ll
see about the reservations.”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t fight me, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
“Father, there’s something you don’t know about me.”
<em>I have to tell him. I’ll never be free from him till I tell him.
Till he knows what he’s made of his only child.</em> “There’s
something you don’t know about me,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t doubt it. Now hurry up, we’ve wasted enough
time.”
</p>

<p>
“Father ... listen to me.” It was almost too hard to say.
Her legs were trembling and her heart was wild.
</p>

<p>
“Well, out with it, for God’s sake! Jesus, Laura, you go
through more agony.... Well? What is it?” He frowned
at her tense face.
</p>

<p>
“I—I’m a—homosexual.”
</p>

<p>
His mouth dropped open and his whole body went
rigid. Laura shut her eyes and prayed. She held her lower
lip in her teeth, ready for the blow, and felt the humiliating
tears begin to squeeze through her shut lids. She
moaned a little.
</p>

<p>
He made up his mind fast and his voice cracked out
like a lash. “Nonsense!” he snarled.
</p>

<p>
“It’s true!” Her eyes flew open and she cried again, passionately,
“It’s true!” It was her bid for freedom; she had
to show this courage, this awful truth to him, or she
would never walk away from him. She would spend all
her life in a panic of fear lest he find her out. “I’m in
love with my roommate. I’ve made love—”
</p>

<p>
“All right, all right, all right!” he shouted. His voice
was rough and his face contorted. He turned away from
her and put his hands over his face. She watched him,
every muscle tight and aching.
</p>

<p>
At last he let his hands drop and said quietly, “Did I
do that to you, Laura?”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="200" id="page-200"></a>
Without hesitating, without even certain knowledge, but
only the huge need to hurt him, she said, “Yes.”
</p>

<p>
He turned slowly around and faced her and she had
never seen his face like that before. It was pained and full
of gentleness. Perhaps it looked that way to her mother
now and then. “I did that to you,” he said again, to himself.
“Oh, Laura. Oh, Laura.” His heavy brow creased
deeply over his eyes. He walked to her and put his hands
on her shoulders and felt her jerk with fear. “Laura,” he
said, “have you ever loved a man?”
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, unable to speak.
</p>

<p>
“Have you ever wanted a man?”
</p>

<p>
Again she shook her head.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know what it’s like to want a man?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” she whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Do you want to know?” His eyes were wide and intense,
his grip on her shoulders was very hard.
</p>

<p>
“I’m so afraid of them, Father. I don’t want to
know.”
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be in another world. Laura was utterly
mystified by his strange behavior, blindly grateful for his
sudden warmth, and she let herself weep softly.
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” he said, as if he derived some private pleasure
from saying her name over and over. “Your mother—you
look so much like your mother. You never looked
like me at all. Every time I look at you I see her face. Her
fragile delicate face. Her eyes, her hair.” He put his arms
around her. “Come back to Chicago with me,” he said
gently. “You don’t have to love a man, Laura. I don’t
want you to. I don’t want you to be like other girls, I
don’t want you to go off with some young ass and give
him your youth and your beauty. I don’t mind if you’re
different from the rest. I can take that if you are able
to.”
</p>

<p>
Laura clung to him, astonished, fearful, grateful, anxious,
a whirlwind of confused feelings churning inside
her.
</p>

<p>
“I want you to stay with me,” he said. “I always did.
I won’t let you go.”
</p>

<p>
“You made me go, Father. You punished me so.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no Laura! Don’t you see, it was myself.” He was
holding her so hard now, as if to make up for years of
<a class="pagenum" title="201" id="page-201"></a>
avoiding her, that she ached with it. She began to cry on
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Father, Father,” she wept. “You never told me
you wanted me to stay with you. You made me believe
you hated me.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” he said. “I never hated you.” He spoke in a rush,
as if he couldn’t help himself, as if it were suddenly forcing
its way out of him after years of suppression. “Never,
Laura, it was just that I was so lonely, so terribly lonely; I
wanted her so much and she was gone. And there was only
you, and you tormented me.”
</p>

<p>
“I?” She tried to see his face, but he held her too close.
</p>

<p>
“You were so much like her, even when you were a child.
Every time I looked at you, I—oh, Laura, it’s myself I
should have punished all this time. I <em>was</em> punished. I’ve
suffered. Believe me. Laura, please believe me.”
</p>

<p>
Laura was suddenly shocked rigid to feel his lips on
her neck. He put his hand in her hair and jerked her head
back and kissed her full on the mouth with such agonized
intensity that he electrified her. He released her just as
suddenly and turned away with a kind of sob. “Ellie!
Ellie!” he cried, his hands over his face.
</p>

<p>
Laura was shaking almost convulsively. At the sound of
her mother’s name she grabbed the thick and heavy glass
ashtray from the dresser, picking it up with both hands.
She rushed at him, unable to think or reason, and brought
the ashtray down on the crown of his head with all the
revolted force in her body. He slumped to the floor without
a sound.
</p>

<p>
Laura gaped at him for a sick second and then she
turned and fled. She left the door wide open and ran in
a terrible panic to the elevators. She sobbed frantically
for a few moments, and then she pushed the down button.
She jabbed it over and over again hysterically, unable
to stop until an elevator arrived and the doors opened.
She stumbled in and pressed into a back corner, helpless
in the grip of the sickness in her. The operator and his
two other passengers stared at her, but she paid them no
heed, even when one asked if he could help her. At the
ground floor the operator had to tell her, “Everybody
out.”
</p>

<p>
She turned a wild flushed face to him and he said, “Are
<a class="pagenum" title="202" id="page-202"></a>
you all right, Miss?” And she glared at him, violently offended
by his manner, his uniform, his question.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you know those pants won’t make a man of
you?” she exclaimed acidly. And rushed out, leaving him
gaping open-mouthed after her.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">arcie</span> called Jack late that night. “I haven’t heard
from her. I wouldn’t bother you, but I don’t know where
she is, and I’m worried,” she said. “Is she with you?”
</p>

<p>
“No. What’s the matter, Marcie? It’s only ten-fifteen.”
</p>

<p>
“She said she’d be home tonight. She promised.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you call the office?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. She wasn’t there today.”
</p>

<p>
“Was she sick?”
</p>

<p>
“No.” Marcie was almost physically sick with shame
and the fear that Laura would do herself violence. She
knew well how passionately Laura could respond, how intensely
she could feel. She had been truly alarmed when
she called the office in the afternoon and Sarah told her
they hadn’t seen Laura all day. And they’d damn well like
to know where she was themselves.
</p>

<p>
“She left the house this morning to catch the subway
to work. She said she’d be back tonight, but she didn’t go
to work. And she isn’t back,” Marcie told Jack.
</p>

<p>
Jack’s first thought was Merrill Landon. “Out with it,
Marcie. Tell Uncle Jack everything.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I can’t—” Jack of all people! Jack, who had a
crush on Laura. Marcie would have slit her throat before
she would have betrayed Laura to him. She was in no
madcap mood any longer. She had wounded Laura with a
callousness that shocked even herself when she thought
back on it. She had no yen to hurt any more.
</p>

<p>
“Come on, doll, we’ve known each other for years,”
Jack said. “Spill the beans.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I won’t hurt her. Not even—”
</p>

<p>
“Not even if she drops dead because you won’t tell me
the truth.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! But she won’t!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, but she might! Now let’s have it.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack, I don’t want you to think—”
</p>

<p>
“I think all the time. It’s a congenital defect.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="204" id="page-204"></a>
“Yes, but this—”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, for Chrissake, Marcie! <em>Say</em> it. Did you quarrel?”
</p>

<p>
“I—yes. We quarreled.”
</p>

<p>
“What about?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t say.”
</p>

<p>
“Now you listen to me, God damn it, I’m getting worried.”
</p>

<p>
“About love.” She whispered it.
</p>

<p>
And Jack knew at once what was the matter. But why
hadn’t Laura come to him? Why hadn’t she told him?
She couldn’t be that ashamed. She knew he wouldn’t hurt
her with the knowledge. He would be kind, with the kindness
of deep sympathy. Something was wrong—more
wrong than Marcie admitted, or more wrong than she
knew. Or both.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t explain, Jack,” Marcie moaned.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to, Marcie. I get the message.”
</p>

<p>
“Should I call the police?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” he said quickly. Jack had an inborn aversion to
cops. “I think I have an idea. I’ll call you back later. And
call me the minute you hear anything.”
</p>

<p>
“I will, I promise!”
</p>

<p>
Jack called Beebo. “Marcie’s straight,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“So what, Jackson?”
</p>

<p>
“So Laura just found out—the hard way, apparently—and
now she’s disappeared.”
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t care less.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t believe you.”
</p>

<p>
“Look, Jack, I don’t even want to talk about the kid. I
don’t want to hear her name mentioned. She can go to
hell as far as I’m concerned.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve got to find her, Beebo, and you’ve got to help
me.”
</p>

<p>
“The hell I do.”
</p>

<p>
“I want you to check the Lessie joints. They won’t let
me in. I busted the mirror in the Colophon last month
and they all hate me.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s your problem.”
</p>

<p>
“Beebo, for God’s sake. I know how bitchy she was.
I’m not asking you to forget it. I’m asking you to help me
find her. I think she went to see her father. From what
she’s told me of him, she might be dead before we find
her.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="205" id="page-205"></a>
There was a shocked silence and finally Beebo said,
“Don’t play around with me, Jack. Tell me the truth.”
</p>

<p>
“That <em>is</em> the truth. He’s a real bastard. God knows
what he might have done to her. He has the Devil’s own
temper and he’s been beating hell out of her since she
was five years old.”
</p>

<p>
There was a reluctant pause at Beebo’s end and finally
she said, “All right, damn it. All right. I’ll go look for her.
If she’s with her father I don’t know what good it’ll do to
check the bars down here.”
</p>

<p>
“You never know. Besides, there’s not much time.”
</p>

<p>
“Okay, Jack. I’ll get going.”
</p>

<p>
“Call me as soon as you get back. Whether you find
her or not.”
</p>

<p>
“Right. Where are you going?”
</p>

<p>
“The McAlton. To check with her old man.”
</p>

<p>
“What about Terry? Can you trust him alone?” she
asked with slight sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
“No,” he said matter-of-factly, looking at Terry as he
spoke, in a voice that betrayed none of his passion for
the boy. “I’m counting on the smoked oysters to keep
him out of trouble.”
</p>

<p>
Terry grinned a little but his eyes didn’t leave the television
set.
</p>

<p>
Beebo laughed. “Okay, doll, I’ll help you out, but don’t
expect me to welcome Laura back and send her flowers.
I’m through with that little bitch. If I find her I’ll
drag her home by the scruff of the neck and dump her.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s good enough, Beebo. Thanks.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo scoured the Village. She knew it inside and out
and backwards: all the gay bars, the favorite coffee
shops, the side streets; the markets, the boutiques, the
stalls and the brownstones; the parks, the alleys, the bookshops.
Some were closed, some stayed open half the night.
Wherever people collected down there, sooner or later
Beebo investigated the spot.
</p>

<p>
The hours stretched out. Every hour or so she called
Jack’s apartment and talked to Terry. He simply said,
“Jack’s not back yet. He hasn’t called in. Okay, I’ll tell
him.” And as Beebo walked she began to feel a real fear
for Laura’s safety, a tender concern that welled up in
her and aroused her own contempt. At three in the morning
she muttered, “Oh, the hell with it. Nobody can cover
<a class="pagenum" title="206" id="page-206"></a>
the whole damn Village in one night.” She called the
penthouse.
</p>

<p>
Marcie, wide awake and alarmed, answered, hoping it
would be Laura. She wasn’t sure if she had a boy or a girl
on the phone; she only knew it wasn’t Laura.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie?” Beebo said.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Who’s this?”
</p>

<p>
“A friend of Laura’s. Is she there?”
</p>

<p>
“No. Do you know where she is?”
</p>

<p>
“I wish I did.”
</p>

<p>
“Who <em>is</em> this?”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll call you back.”
</p>

<p>
Marcie sat holding the receiver and staring perplexed
at the phone some minutes after Beebo hung up.
</p>

<p>
Jack got back in the first light of dawn to find Terry
asleep. He sat down without taking his jacket off, and
called Beebo. No answer. Terry rolled over and looked at
him. He was a medium-sized well-built boy, bright and
handsome and easily bored, affectionate by nature, but
spoiled, quick with his temper and quick with his generosity.
He was not quite sure, being young and desirable,
if he was in love with Jack. He liked being admired by a
lot of people. But he was not the money grubber Jack
had painted for Laura. He liked to be dominated and he
was waiting for Jack to make a move in that direction.
</p>

<p>
“Where the hell have you been?” he asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
“Where’s Beebo?”
</p>

<p>
“How should I know? You’re the one who knows it all.”
</p>

<p>
“Just this once, don’t get smart with me, lover. I gotta
find her.” Jack was too worried to coddle him.
</p>

<p>
“She’ll call back on the hour. She’s been calling in every
God-damn hour since you went out. I can’t get any sleep
around here. Who’s this Laura, anyway? She must be a
living doll.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve told you a dozen times. She’s a friend.”
</p>

<p>
“You act like she was a lover.”
</p>

<p>
Jack stared at his handsome arrogant young face. “So
what?” he said. “You have your affairs. I have mine.”
And he turned around and walked into the bathroom
and left Terry staring after him. Jack never talked that
way to him, not even when he caught him <em>in flagrante
delicto</em>. He never showed an erotic interest in girls, either.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="207" id="page-207"></a>
The phone rang fifteen minutes later. It was Beebo.
Terry answered and handed Jack the phone, listening to
the conversation with his eyes half open.
</p>

<p>
“Absolutely no soap,” Beebo said. “I’ve been all over
the damn Village. Nobody’s seen her.”
</p>

<p>
“She saw Landon earlier this evening,” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
“She did? Does he know where she is?”
</p>

<p>
“He doesn’t know from nothing, doll. She gave him a
first class concussion. Walloped him with a glass ashtray.
On the back of his head. Must have snuck up on him
when he had his back turned.”
</p>

<p>
“God!” Beebo exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“And then took off, hysterical, according to the elevator
boy. She screamed all kinds of stuff at him. He says.
Half of it’s crap, of course. But he did tell me one thing—”
</p>

<p>
“What’s that?”
</p>

<p>
“She told him those pants he was wearing would never
make a man of him.”
</p>

<p>
After a surprised silence Beebo gave a wry tired little
laugh. “Jesus,” she said. “She must have been screwy.”
</p>

<p>
“The elevator boy thought so. It sounds kind of bad.
I’d better call Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“I called her at three.”
</p>

<p>
“God, Beebo, don’t make it any worse than it is!”
</p>

<p>
“Relax. I didn’t leave my name. Just asked for Laura
and Marcie said she wasn’t there. Well, Jackson? Now
what? We call the cops?”
</p>

<p>
“You want us all to get thrown in the jug? They’d
love to run in a bunch of queers. No, let’s wait a day.
She’s a sensible girl underneath it all. She’ll come to her
senses and I’m the first one she’ll call.” Terry, on the
bed beside him, gave a contemptuous snort.
</p>

<p>
“I wish I felt so confident,” Beebo said.
</p>

<p>
“Yeah,” Jack said. “I do too,” he admitted.
</p>

<p>
“Okay, boy, keep in touch.”
</p>

<p>
Jack hung up and sat drooping on the bed, the fatigue
showing in his face.
</p>

<p>
“God, you look old,” Terry said with a characteristic
lack of tact. “How old are you? You never told me.”
</p>

<p>
“Eighty-two,” Jack said.
</p>

<p>
Terry grinned, “I don’t believe you.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re not supposed to.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="208" id="page-208"></a>
“How old? Tell me.”
</p>

<p>
Jack stood up and turned to face him, in no mood for
jokes. “Terry, don’t bug me. I’ve had enough of you
today.” Terry gaped at him. Jack had never talked harshly
to him and now he was doing it every time he opened
his mouth. “I love this girl,” Jack told him. “I don’t know
why, but I do know that for once I’ve found a decent
sweet kid who isn’t out for every damn thing she can get
from me. She can give a little, she doesn’t have to take all
the time.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you love her!” Terry said sarcastically, propping
himself up on his elbows. “That’s swell. Just swell! Thanks
for letting me in on it.”
</p>

<p>
“And I’ll probably love her long after you’ve climbed
out of this bed for the last time, you little bastard. You
and a dozen other guys. It’s a kind of love you don’t
know much about, Terry.” He was too tired, too worried,
to take much heed of what he said or how. His resentment
spilled out and it felt good to let go with it and he did.
</p>

<p>
Terry wasn’t used to being disciplined. He had managed,
in eighteen crafty years, to avoid it. So he was surprised
at himself when he reacted to Jack’s tongue lashing with
a renewal of interest in him. He lay back on the bed
and watched Jack strip to his underwear. Jack was not a
beautiful man physically; tough and wiry, but not beautiful.
Yet Terry watched him with enjoyment, wondering
what to expect from him next.
</p>

<p>
Jack stretched out on the bed next to Terry. There was
an hour or so when he could sleep before he had to get
to the office. He turned his head a little and saw Terry
watching him. “You still here?” he said. “I thought I
told you to go.”
</p>

<p>
“I think I’ll stay,” Terry said, smiling. “I’m a glutton for
punishment.” He was intrigued by this new side of Jack.
</p>

<p>
Jack turned over and looked at him, surprised. “You’re
a brat,” he said finally. “A beautiful, unbearable, stuck-up,
silly, irresistible brat.”
</p>

<p>
Terry laughed. “That’s why you love me, Superman,”
he said, poking Jack in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
“Who says I love you?” Jack said wearily and turned
away from him.
</p>

<p>
“Jack, be nice to me.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="209" id="page-209"></a>
“I’m worried sick and he wants me to be nice to him.
Ha!” Jack told the walls.
</p>

<p>
“Damn it, I think you <em>do</em> love this girl.”
</p>

<p>
“She bought your oysters, lover. You can spare her a
little good will yourself.”
</p>

<p>
Terry dropped back on his pillow in silent surprise.
It was the first hint he had had of the state of Jack’s
finances.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Jack went to work. There was nothing to be accomplished
sitting around the apartment quarreling with
Terry. It wouldn’t bring Laura back any sooner, and there
was not much he could do to find her now. Except call
in the police and he gagged on that idea. He would wait
at least until the next morning.
</p>

<p>
But at the end of the day things were getting black.
Laura was still gone; Marcie was panicky and agitating
for a call to the police; Beebo was glowering, furious at
herself for caring what happened to Laura and yet caring
anyway in spite of herself; and a thunderstorm was
brewing.
</p>

<p>
They waited alone, Jack and Marcie and Beebo, in the
gathering dark: each with his own peculiar fears and
hopes. Jack drank. Marcie paced around the roof, praying
God that Laura hadn’t killed herself. Beebo came over
after a while and talked to Jack.
</p>

<p>
They talked, they drank, the phone rang. Terry wandered
around the apartment in a pet because nobody was
paying any attention to him. In another part of town
Burr cursed silently because Marcie would pay no attention
to <em>him</em>. And still elsewhere Merrill Landon lay with
an aching head and heart and peppered the detective
agency he had hired with evil-tempered calls while they
labored to locate his daughter.
</p>

<p>
Finally Terry exploded at Jack, “If you don’t talk to
me I’m going to get out of here!” He gave the nearest
chair a petulant kick. “I don’t have to hang around
here till I drop dead from boredom.”
</p>

<p>
“Go,” said Jack. “You’re driving me nuts anyway with
that damn pacing the floor.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish I <em>was</em> driving you nuts,” Terry retorted. “I just
seem to be in your way.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="210" id="page-210"></a>
“You are, lover. Shut up and eat something. You’ll
feel better.”
</p>

<p>
“I just ate!”
</p>

<p>
“Then just shut up.”
</p>

<p>
“God! This place is a mausoleum. I’ve had enough!”
He went to the bedroom and grabbed a sweater, but when
he reached the front door he turned and found that Jack
wasn’t even looking at him. He was talking to Beebo. He
was saying, “By God, it’s worth a try. I’m going over
there. Nothing could be worse than sitting here wondering
if she’s drowned in the damn river or swinging from
a rope somewhere.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, for Chrissake, Jack!” Beebo snapped. “Have mercy.
I’m not made of stone.”
</p>

<p>
Jack got up and headed for the door. Terry stood uncertainly
and watched him approach. “Make up your
mind,” Jack said to him. “In or out?” His anxiety over
Laura made this attitude of impatience with Terry perfectly
genuine. Yet Jack was not without a small sudden
pleasure at Terry’s reactions.
</p>

<p>
“How about you?” Terry said.
</p>

<p>
“Out.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll go with you.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll be back in an hour.”
</p>

<p>
“I want to go with you.”
</p>

<p>
Jack stared at him, again pleased and surprised. “You
can’t,” was all he said, putting his cigarette in his mouth
while he pulled his jacket on.
</p>

<p>
“Why the hell not?”
</p>

<p>
Jack took him by the shoulders. “Terry, you want to do
something for me?”
</p>

<p>
Terry eyed him like a suspicious five-year-old. “I don’t
know. You’re so bitchy tonight.” He sighed. “All right,
all right. What do I have to do?”
</p>

<p>
“Stay here. And if she shows up, hang on to her. I’ll be
back at—” He looked at his watch. “—at ten. No later.”
</p>

<p>
Terry threw himself in an armchair with a huge sigh of
disgust. “Oh, this Laura!” he groaned. “She must be the
most fabulous female in the whole goddam world.”
</p>

<p>
“She is,” Beebo said briefly. She dinched her cigarette
and walked out ahead of Jack. “I’ll be at home, Terry,”
she called back. “If she shows up.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="211" id="page-211"></a>
“Yeah, yeah, I know. I’ll hogtie her and call all the
newspapers. I’ll notify the President. Christ!”
</p>

<p>
Jack and Beebo went down the stairs together and out
into the lowering night. The first drops were coming
down. “What’d you give him, Jackson?” Beebo smiled.
“He’s learning how to mind. He doesn’t like it very much,
but he’s learning.”
</p>

<p>
Jack shrugged. “He does like it, doll. That’s the secret.
He likes to be shoved around a little. I wish to hell I’d
known before I bought all those stinking oysters.”
</p>

Chapter Sixteen
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was five past ten and the rain was fairly heavy outside.
Terry was curled up in the armchair watching television,
eating peanuts and drinking a beer. He was irritated
with Jack for being late. He tried to get interested
in the film and sat for a quarter of an hour with his eyes
on the set, wiggling restlessly, like a child in need of a
comfort station. He jumped when a knock on the door disturbed
him.
</p>

<p>
“Come in, you know it’s not locked,” he said without
looking up. “Where the hell were you? At least I tell you
where I’m going. Well talk, damn it.” And he turned
around to see a tall slim girl standing five feet from him,
her long hair streaming wet and her clothes clinging to
her body. He was conscious of nothing in her face but her
eyes; huge, blue and heavy, dominating, agonized.
</p>

<p>
Terry stood up suddenly, stammering a little. “You must
be Laura,” he said finally. “I was beginning to think
you weren’t real.” He took another look at her, pale as a
wraith, her eyes the only warmth in the cold oval of
her face. “Are you?” he asked. And then smiled a little
sheepishly. “Well, don’t just stand there. Come in and sit
down.”
</p>

<p>
She moved as if she were dreaming, one hand to her
forehead, and he guided her to the sofa where she half
sat and half collapsed, letting her head fall back against
the cushions. She looked utterly exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Terry stood hovering uncertainly over her, staring at
her. At last he said, “Jack says I’ve got to keep you here.”
She shut her eyes. “He’s supposed to be home at ten. He
should be right along. I’m Terry. Terry Fleming. Jack
says he told you about me. He certainly talks a lot about
you. He thinks the world of you.” She gave no sign that
she had heard or cared to hear.
</p>

<p>
At last in some consternation he said, “Would you like
something to eat, Laura? You look like you could do
<a class="pagenum" title="213" id="page-213"></a>
with something.” No answer. He went out to the kitchen
and opened a can of soup. He fixed up the plate with
crackers and cheese and, as a second thought, smoked
oysters, and poured a glass of milk. Every two or three
minutes he interrupted his task to go to the doorway and
check on her. He thought she might vanish, like a ghost.
But she didn’t move. She looked dead. She scared him.
</p>

<p>
He put the food on a tray and brought it into the living
room and sat down on the sofa next to her. He put the
soup and milk on the coffee table in front of her and
then he said, “Wake up. Wake up, Laura.” She didn’t
stir. Terry put an oyster on a cracker. “Here,” he said,
shaking her a little. “Here, for God’s sake, eat it. It’s
your oyster.”
</p>

<p>
Laura stirred and opened her eyes, took one look at
the smoked oyster, and turned away with a grimace. Terry
was offended. “So what’s wrong with smoked oysters?” he
said. “Here. It’s yours.”
</p>

<p>
She looked at him then. Really saw him. And then sat
up a little, rubbing her eyes. “Mine?” she repeated dimly.
</p>

<p>
“Jack says you bought ’em.” Terry looked at her with
bright eyes, curious now. “You might as well enjoy them.”
</p>

<p>
Laura sighed and then saw the soup. Terry handed her
a spoon and she ate it all without a pause or a word. It
seemed to give her strength, to bring her back to life. “I
haven’t eaten.” she apologized. “I can’t remember ...”
</p>

<p>
“Want some more?” he asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
“No. No thanks. Maybe later.” She looked around the
apartment, recognition and sense coming back to her face.
“Where’s Jack?” she said, and suddenly clutched Terry’s
sleeve. “Where’s Jack?” She sounded frightened.
</p>

<p>
“He’ll be back any minute,” Terry said.
</p>

<p>
Laura stared at him then. “Oh, you’re Terry,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“You’re Laura.” He grinned. “I saw you first.”
</p>

<p>
She blinked at him, unable to joke with him. Dead serious,
she asked, “Did the oysters help?”
</p>

<p>
“Help?” he said. “Oh. You mean Jack and me.”
</p>

<p>
“He says you love them.”
</p>

<p>
Terry studied her, frowning over his smile, and then
looked away in embarrassment. “Not the oysters so much,”
he said. “But <em>you</em> helped, in a roundabout way. By getting
lost.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="214" id="page-214"></a>
“I’m glad,” she said, confused. “He loves you terribly.”
She seemed to have no sense that this might startle him
or be the wrong thing to say. She hadn’t the physical
strength to censor herself. She spoke the necessary truths
and no more. But Terry was strongly affected. He walked
to the other side of the room and refused to look at her
for a while, letting his feelings whirl around inside him.
When he did look back, she was stretched out on the sofa,
sleeping the sleep of complete exhaustion.
</p>

<p class="tb">

</p>

<p class="noindent">
Laura woke up to find Jack sitting in the armchair sipping
gingerly at a steaming cup of coffee. His eyes showed
over the rim of the cup, heavy, anxious, and old. He lowered
the cup when she wakened, putting it on the coffee
table by the sofa and lighting a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a nice day,” he said cautiously.
</p>

<p>
She sat up halfway. “What time is it?”
</p>

<p>
“Seven-thirty.”
</p>

<p>
Laura dropped back and shut her eyes. She found a
blanket over herself and her shoes were on the floor beside
the sofa.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Jack, “are you going to tell me where
the hell you’ve been? Or am I going to ask?”
</p>

<p>
Laura turned her face suddenly to the back of the sofa
and wept. “Oh, Jack,” she moaned. “I killed him. I killed
him. Oh, God help me.” And she began to sob.
</p>

<p>
“Killed who?”
</p>

<p>
“My father.”
</p>

<p>
“Your father,” he said with friendly sharpness in his
voice, “has a prize concussion. But he’s very much alive.”
</p>

<p>
She turned her head slowly to look at him, her eyes
enormous and her heart stopped in her chest. “Alive?”
Her voice was a startled whisper. She sat up suddenly and
said it out loud. “Alive?” She grabbed Jack’s arms with
the strength of shock. “How do you know? How do you
know? Tell me quickly.”
</p>

<p>
“I will, give me half a chance.” He pushed her back
down and told her of his trip to the McAlton. “I just went
up to the fourteenth floor,” he said. “It was easy. There
were a lot of people standing around outside his room and
the elevator boy told me about it. Incidentally, you made
a real friend. He thinks you’re the original Goof Nut.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="215" id="page-215"></a>
“But my father, Jack, my father?”
</p>

<p>
“There was a doctor with him. He’s okay, Mother.”
</p>

<p>
Laura half fainted and it was some minutes before Jack
could bring her around. Terry sat on the floor by the sofa,
watching her with interest while Jack propped her feet up
on pillows. “That better?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“I hit him so hard,” she murmured the moment she was
able to talk. “I was sure I killed him. Maybe he died of
the concussion.” Her eyes went wide again with fear and
she looked at Jack, but he shook his head with a little
smile.
</p>

<p>
“No such luck,” he said. “I talked to him last night.”
</p>

<p>
She gasped. “What did you say? Is he all right? Did
you tell him who you were?” The fears tumbled out of
her.
</p>

<p>
“I called him on the house phone. Relax, Laura, you’re
among friends. I asked him if he knew where you were.
He said no.”
</p>

<p>
“What else?” Laura had clutched his arms with trembling
hands.
</p>

<p>
“He was pretty curious about <em>me</em>, naturally. But I
didn’t give him my name and phone number. Now calm
down, will you? You’re giving me the screaming mimis.”
</p>

<p>
“What did he say?” She was crying again. “What? Tell
me!”
</p>

<p>
“He tried to get me to talk but I didn’t tell him anything,
except that I was your best friend. Finally he said he
was afraid he had hurt you.” Laura shut her eyes and covered
her face with a groan. “He wanted a chance to explain.
He said if I found you to tell him right away. He
has an agency trying to track you down. He said to tell
you he’s sorry.” Jack looked curiously at her.
</p>

<p>
“He’s sorry,” she repeated, staring. “He’s sorry!”
</p>

<p>
“Did he hurt you, honey?” Jack said gently.
</p>

<p>
It was too enormous to describe, too torturous to explain;
her own private agony. Not even Jack could share it
with her. “Yes,” she whispered. “He hurt me.” She looked
at Jack and he could see in her face how much more there
was to it than the simple words told him.
</p>

<p>
Jack crushed out his cigarette angrily. “I wish I could
break his head for him,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” Laura said. “I thought I had killed him. I
<a class="pagenum" title="216" id="page-216"></a>
never meant to. I was sick. I’ve been so sick, Jack, you
wouldn’t believe—Oh, thank God he’s alive. Thank God.
I wanted to hurt him and I did. I never wanted anything
more. Just a chance to get even with him.”
</p>

<p>
“What the hell happened between you two?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t talk about it.”
</p>

<p>
“You can to me.”
</p>

<p>
“No. I can’t. Not to anybody.”
</p>

<p>
“Did he beat you?”
</p>

<p>
She shook her head. “Don’t ask me, Jack,” she said.
“It’s my own personal sickness. And his. It’s between us,
and nobody else.”
</p>

<p>
Jack lighted a cigarette, watching her closely through
the blue smoke. “Why did you go to him in the first
place? Didn’t you know it would be bad?”
</p>

<p>
“I had to,” she said, her face drawn and intense. “I’ve
been running away from him all my life. I had to quit running
and save myself. I had to tell him face to face what
I am.”
</p>

<p>
Jack’s brows drew together heavily. “You told him you
were gay?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. I told him.”
</p>

<p>
“What did he do?”
</p>

<p>
She turned her deep eyes, accentuated by the thinness
of her face, to Jack. “He hurt me, Jack. And I hurt him.
But it’s all over. Oh, my God, I’m so grateful I didn’t kill
him. Have you ever thought you killed somebody, and
tried to go on living with it? It eats you up, it corrodes
your brain and your body, it makes you sick, oh, so horribly
sick. Oh, Jack....” And he put his arms around her
while she wept and Terry watched them in silence.
</p>

<p>
“That bastard,” Jack murmured, comforting her. “That
damn bastard. I think I hate him as much as you do,
honey.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, I don’t hate him,” she whispered. “I can’t any
more. I never will again. I understand now, so much.
Nothing ever made sense before, but now I understand.
He was weaker than I was, Jack.” She spoke with wonderment.
“He was more afraid of me than I was of him.”
It was a strange new feeling this knowledge gave her. “I
don’t know quite how I feel about him now. I won’t know
for a long time, I guess. But I still love him. I always
<a class="pagenum" title="217" id="page-217"></a>
loved him, even when I hated him the most. I only hope
we never meet again. I can stand it if I never have to see
him again.”
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Terry fixed her a breakfast, and she ate ravenously.
She discovered they had stripped her wet clothes off and
put a robe on her the night before while she slept. She
pulled the robe close around her while Jack tried to make
her tell him where she had been, but he got little satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know,” was all she would say, and when he
protested, skeptically, she turned to him, her face earnest,
and said, “I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“Ahhh, don’t tell <em>me</em>,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“I just walked, I guess. It all seems like a nightmare.
The first thing I remember after I left Father is eating
a bowl of soup. And then I fell asleep.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you remember me?” Terry said. “We had a nice
little talk last night.”
</p>

<p>
“We did?” She was surprised.
</p>

<p>
“Sure.” He smiled, and made her blush with embarrassment.
“I’ll tell you all about it sometime.” He grinned at
Jack who gave him a quizzical smile.
</p>

<p>
“So you don’t know where you were?” he prodded
Laura.
</p>

<p>
“I swear, Jack.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, we didn’t know either,” he said. “And we damn
near lost our minds. We pictured you—well, never mind
what we pictured. You had us frantic, I can tell you.”
</p>

<p>
Laura smiled at him a little. “Jack,” she said, and put
a hand on his arm. “You’ve been so good to me. I
wouldn’t have caused you any worry, only—only—oh, my
God. Marcie! I forgot about Marcie. And Beebo.” She
turned to him, but he calmed her with a glance, holding
her down in her chair.
</p>

<p>
“I called them,” he said. “I called everybody. Even
Papa Landon. I told them you were all right, and that’s
all. Your father doesn’t know where you are.”
</p>

<p>
Laura hung her head. “Jack, I didn’t have a chance to
tell you about Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. You don’t have to tell me. Marcie did.”
</p>

<p>
“Marcie did?” She looked up amazed.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="218" id="page-218"></a>
“Not in so many words, Mother. She just said you quarreled,
and I got the idea. She sounds pretty unhappy
about things.”
</p>

<p>
Laura covered her face, her elbows resting on the table.
“She knew, Jack. She knew all along that I was gay,” she
whispered brokenly. “She and Burr had a bet that she
could make me make a pass at her.”
</p>

<p>
After a long silence Jack squeezed her arm and said
gently, “You had to learn. Now you know. We all go
through it sooner or later.” He looked up at Terry and
found the boy staring at him, his eyes full. He looked
away, confused, turning his attention back to Laura. “She
wants to see you. She means it.”
</p>

<p>
“I know. But I couldn’t stand to see her. Even talk to
her. It would be hell.”
</p>

<p>
“I know what you mean.” Jack got up and poured himself
another cup of coffee, saving himself a half inch in
the cup for a jigger of whiskey.
</p>

<p>
“It’s not even ten o’clock yet,” Terry reproached him.
</p>

<p>
“Shut up and drink your milk,” Jack said and smiled
at him.
</p>

<p>
“I’d better call the office,” Laura ventured quietly.
</p>

<p>
“I did,” Jack told her. “You’re fired. They were damn
nice about it, though. Dr. Hollingsworth wants you to
come in and talk to him. Sarah gave me the pitch. It
seems they admire your brains but they figure your nerves
are loused up. I suggest, Mother, that you see my analyst.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t afford it.”
</p>

<p>
“Neither can I.” Jack laughed. “Let’s put Terry to
work,” he said to Laura. “It’s time he earned his own
way.”
</p>

<p>
“Doing what?” Terry said.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know. What are you good for? Anything?”
</p>

<p>
“I can cook.” Terry grinned.
</p>

<p>
“Good. I know a Greasy Spoon two blocks from here.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, hell!”
</p>

<p>
“Jack,” Laura said suddenly. “Does Beth know I’m all
right?”
</p>

<p>
“Beth?” Jack frowned at her. “You mean Beebo, doll.”
</p>

<p>
“I mean Beebo,” Laura said quickly, growing hot.
</p>

<p>
“She knows.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="219" id="page-219"></a>
“Did you tell her when I disappeared?”
</p>

<p>
“She looked all over the Village for you. She was worried.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you think she’d talk to me?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Jack.” She turned an unhappy face to him, pleading
for a chance to hope.
</p>

<p>
“She might say ‘goodby’ to you. Or ‘go to hell’. Don’t
expect miracles.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess I haven’t any right to her friendship any more.”
But it suddenly seemed terribly important; the most important
thing in the world.
</p>

<p>
“Not as long as you get her mixed up with Beth.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, that was just a slip of the tongue.”
</p>

<p>
Jack stood up and paced across the kitchen. He turned,
resting his rump on the counter by the sink, and parked
his coffee cup next to him. “Laura,” he said seriously.
“You fell in love with a girl named Beth once. You told
me that. Then you and Beth broke up and Beth married
somebody and quit school. And then you ran away from
home. And you came to New York, and every damn female
you met reminded you of Beth.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no—” Laura began, but he held up a hand to silence
her.
</p>

<p>
“Now listen to me, damn it! I’m beginning to wonder
if you were running away from your father or from Beth.”
</p>

<p>
“Jack!” Laura stood up and faced him, her temper
rising.
</p>

<p>
“Marcie and Beebo look about as much alike as Laurel
and Hardy. Yet they both remind you of Beth.”
</p>

<p>
“But that doesn’t mean—”
</p>

<p>
“And you fell for both of them. And don’t tell me they
were the only ones.” His eyes were hard to meet. Laura
looked down.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head. “No,” she whispered, confused,
rubbing her eyes. “No.”
</p>

<p>
“Beth must have been a great girl, Mother. But you
can’t stay in love with her all of your life. Even if she <em>was</em>
the first one.” Laura’s face flushed.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t talk about this, Jack!” she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t have to. I will.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s <em>my</em> private life.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="220" id="page-220"></a>
“You’ve pulled me into it. What’s the matter, are you
afraid to hear me talk about it?”
</p>

<p>
She sat down, angry. “No,” she said sharply. “I’m not
afraid.”
</p>

<p>
Jack took a sip of his café royale. “Okay,” he said in a
business-like voice. “I’m going to tell you something you
won’t like. But I think you ought to know it. You were
never in love with Marcie, Laura.”
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other and finally Laura exploded,
“You’re cracked! I thought you understood. I thought
you—<em>you</em>, of all people—understood how I felt about
her!”
</p>

<p>
“I did.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t want to hear any more!”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t doubt it,” he said. She rose again and faced
him, defiant and hurt. “You loved Beth,” he said, more
gently. “You loved love. It showed in all you said to me,
when we first met. You needed love and you went looking
for it. You went looking for another Beth. You were
bound to find her. You found her in every female face
that appealed to you.
</p>

<p>
“Laura,” Jack said slowly. “Marcie doesn’t look like
Beth. Neither does Beebo. Nobody looks like Beth but
Beth. And Beth is gone. She isn’t yours any more. She
belongs to a man.”
</p>

<p>
Laura covered her face suddenly with a groan. “Jack,
don’t! Please,” she whimpered. Then, gathering her anger
around her, she said, “They <em>do</em> look like her! I swear they
do!”
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head. “They just looked like love,
Mother.”
</p>

<p>
Laura gave a little sob. “Jack, don’t torture me.”
</p>

<p>
“You know why I’m doing it. You know I don’t want
to hurt you. Now listen to me, Laura. You can’t stay in
love with Beth all your life.”
</p>

<p>
Laura put her hands down and looked at him again.
“Jack, you don’t know how wonderful she was. You never
knew her, you can’t talk about her. She was so beautiful,
she was so good to me. She made me understand what I
was, when I was so ignorant and scared that you wouldn’t
believe it! And she made me understand without hurting
me. She made it beautiful. I owe her so much. I loved
her so.”
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="221" id="page-221"></a>
“But she’s married, Laura. You told me that yourself.
You’ll never even see her again. No matter how good she
was.”
</p>

<p>
“She never hurt me!” Laura flared. “Marcie hurt me,
Beebo hurt me, but never Beth.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, balls!” Jack said. “Never hurt you, hell! She left
you, didn’t she! She slept with a guy and married him.
What do you want, Mother, a silk-lined accident-proof
guaranteed romance? Good for six months with lotsa
kicks and no pain? Or your money back? They don’t come
that way. Ask anybody. Ask me. Ask Terry.” And then his
face softened. “She’s gone, Laura,” he said quietly, significantly.
“And you can’t go back to Marcie.”
</p>

<p>
Laura sat down and let the tears roll down her face,
and her mouth trembled. “And I can’t go back to Beebo,”
she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Jack walked over to her and leaned on the table, one
arm on either side of her. He put his head against hers
and said into her ear, almost in a whisper, “Beebo loves
you, honey. She’s no Beth. No Marcie. She’s herself, and
for all you know, that may be even better.”
</p>

<p>
Laura covered her face then and cried.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen minutes later Jack, who had gone into the bedroom
to dress, came back to the kitchen and said, “I’m
going to the office for the rest of the day. Somebody has
to pay the rent.” He looked at Terry with a wry smile.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked up quickly. “I’ve <em>got</em> to talk to her, Jack.
Where can I find her?”
</p>

<p>
“Beebo? She’s working. Stick around till I get home,
Mother. Sleep. You look like hell. Get Terry to read you a
story or something. You can see her tonight.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks.” She looked at him with wet eyes and then
she smiled. “Thanks, Jack. For everything.”
</p>

<p>
He grinned. “It’s those damn oysters,” he said. “I’m a
new man.” He winked at Terry and left.

Chapter Seventeen
</h2>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> Cellar was not very crowded when Laura walked in
at eight o’clock. By a quarter to nine, when Beebo got
there, the place had filled up a little and the juke box
was going. Dutton, the sketch artist, was making a few
bucks with the tourists. There was a tableful of them in
one corner that he was working on. Beebo sat down at the
bar and began to josh the bartender. She didn’t see Laura,
and Laura’s heart was pounding so high in her chest that
she was afraid to go near Beebo. She didn’t know what to
say. She was sickeningly afraid of a rebuff, and she hung
back in a sweat. She deserved a rebuttal, but she was
afraid she couldn’t take it.
</p>

<p>
She watched Beebo for a while, her face shaded slightly
as she leaned away from the bar lights. She let the heads
of the people next to her serve as a sort of cover behind
which she could dodge when Beebo glanced her way.
</p>

<p>
For a while she was tortured to see Beebo chatting with
other women; young pretty girls, like the two high-schoolers
Laura had met with her one night.
</p>

<p class="tb">
* * *
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Beebo was tired. She had two drinks and then she meant
to go home. But she was detained by a boy who ran an
antique shop a block from her apartment, who was a
friend. They talked about nothing in particular, just glad
to talk with somebody for a while. Beebo was slightly surprised
when Dutton came up and handed her one of his
sheets of drawing paper. Beebo took it with a wry little
grin. “I knew you’d get around to me sooner or later, Dutton,”
she said. “I’m part of the décor in this joint. Let’s
see.” She studied the caricature. “I hate to admit it, but
it’s good. Does my chin stick out like that?”
</p>

<p>
Dutton grinned. “Take it from me,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Beebo eyed him. “You don’t think you’re going to get a
buck out of me for this, do you?” she said, waving it under
his nose.
</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" title="223" id="page-223"></a>
“I’ve got my buck, friend,” Dutton said, holding a
folded bill up between his thumb and index finger. He
smiled and pushed the sketch back at her. “It’s yours,” he
said. “Keep it.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo studied him a moment, frowning, and then she
looked up and down the bar.
</p>

<p>
“If you don’t like it,” Laura said softly in her ear, “just
tear it up. I can’t complain.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo turned on the bar stool to find Laura standing
close behind her. They gazed at each other in silence
for a moment. Then Beebo tore the sketch once across the
long way and once the short, still watching Laura. And
dropped the pieces on the floor. Laura looked at her, trembling.
Beebo turned back to the bar and finished her drink
at <a id="corr-30"></a>one swallow. Then she said to the boy beside her, “See
you, Daisy.” And she got up and left the bar.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, Laura thought she would die where she
stood. And then she followed Beebo, walking twenty feet
behind her, her heart working hard and making her gasp
a little. Beebo walked out into the night, and Laura
followed her, coming just a little closer, until she was
about five feet behind her. Beebo walked on, slowly, without
glancing back, without hurrying her pace. They walked
for two full blocks like this, and across the street into a
third.
</p>

<p>
And then Beebo stopped. Startled and scared, Laura
stopped where she was, on the curb, with the street light
illuminating her silver blonde hair and leaving her face in
the shadow.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Beebo turned around. She looked at Laura. She
dropped the cigarette in her hand and crushed it under
her heel. For some moments they just stood there and
gazed at each other. A man walked by, and then a couple.
Then the street was empty.
</p>

<p>
Finally Laura said, in a whisper that carried clearly
to Beebo’s heart, “I love you, Beebo. Darling, I love you.”
</p>

<p>
Beebo walked over to her, still moving very slowly, until
they stood together in the pool of light just inches from
each other. The dawn of a smile showed on her face.
</p>

<p>
“Little bitch,” she said softly. “Laura ... Laura....”
She leaned down then, tipping Laura’s face up to hers,
“I can’t hate you any more,” she said. “I’ve given up.
<a class="pagenum" title="224" id="page-224"></a>
There’s nothing left but love.” And she kissed her. Their
arms went around each other suddenly, hard, and they
stood there in the lamplight, kissing.
</p>

<p>
Then they turned and walked into the night toward
Cordelia Street.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
