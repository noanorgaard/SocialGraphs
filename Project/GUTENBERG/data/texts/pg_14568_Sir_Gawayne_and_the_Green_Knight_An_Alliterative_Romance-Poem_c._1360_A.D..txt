<h2>
      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
    </h2>
<p>
      In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
      transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F. Madden's
      "Syr Gawayne."
    </p>
<p>
      I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
      proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the reader
      a text free from any errors of transcription.
    </p>
<p>
      The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
      contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text
      to enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's
      pleasant narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.
    </p>
<p>
      The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"<sup>1</sup> to
      which, for the better interpretation of the text, I have made several
      additions, and have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously
      left unexplained.
    </p>
<p>
      For a description of the Manuscript, and particulars relating to the
      authorship and dialect of the present work, the reader is referred to the
      preface to <i>Early English Alliterative Poems</i>.

<h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
<p>
      No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
      Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the
      renowned Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a man
      matchless on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the hardiest
      of hand, the most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in hall, whose
      knowledge, knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and deeds of
      arms were known in all lands.
    </p>
<p>
      When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed
      in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this blood were
      worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author, too, loves to
      speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him the knight
      faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned with every
      earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in the five
      wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the true knight
      were more firmly established than in any other on earth.
    </p>
<p>
      The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious poems,
      had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better subject
      for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be
      combined. In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though
      tempted sorely not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow
      of chastity, but turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of
      purity and arm of faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous
      defile of trial and opportunity seeming safe.
    </p>
<p>
      But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from
      the "Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the narrative
      more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly
      interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of
      our ancestors.
    </p>
<p>
      The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
      notice:—
    </p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll. 568-589).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll. 1126-1359).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll. 1412-1614).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
      The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more or
      less in the words of the writer himself:—
    </p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas festival at
        Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round Table, noble
        lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the loveliest that
        ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate the New Year by
        a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the most joyous
        mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the table—Queen
        Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the daïs, the high
        table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain together with
        other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115). Arthur, in mood
        as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild, declares that
        he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing,
        some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some encounter of arms has
        occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll. 85-106).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the noise
        of nakers and noble pipes.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          "Each two had dishes twelve,
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Good beer and bright wine both."
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
        music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
        stature—the greatest on earth—in measure high. He was
        clothed entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178).
        Fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great
        beard like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
        bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
        as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the Green Knight
        enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word that he uttered
        was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I see him and
        with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye, looking for
        the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to see a man and a
        horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener they seemed than
        green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they seen, but none such
        as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat stone-still in a dead
        silence, as if overpowered by sleep;
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          "Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight, bids him
        welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The knight says
        that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
        valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his courage to
        the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's court. "I
        come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I bear
        here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
        hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
        because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as
        all men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
        courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
        failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
        fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
        arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me (ll.
        250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year, and I
        see around me many brave ones;—if any be so bold in his blood that
        dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe to do
        with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as I sit,
        and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that I deal
        him another in return.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          And yet give I him respite,
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          A twelvemonth and a day;
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Now haste and let see tite (soon)
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Dare any here-in ought say.'"
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this speech,
        and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in his
        saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
        brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
        would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the
        fame of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown of
        the Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for all
        tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With this
        he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed as
        wroth as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
        great words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!"
        Arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
        about, while the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry countenance,
        stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the blow (ll.
        314-335). Sir Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his uncle to
        let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty of his
        nobles, Arthur consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll. 336-365).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
        dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good faith,"
        answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to this
        buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
        take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
        wight else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me well
        that I shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought here—moreover
        thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant,—but thou
        shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek me thyself,
        wheresoever on earth thou believest I may be found, and fetch thee such
        wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of doughty ones."
        "Where should I seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is thy place? I know
        not thee, thy court, or thy name. I wot not where thou dwellest, but
        teach me thereto, tell me how thou art called, and I shall endeavour to
        find thee,—and that I swear thee for truth and by my sure troth."
        "That is enough in New Year," says the groom in green, "if I tell thee
        when I have received the tap. When thou hast smitten me, then smartly I
        will teach thee of my house, my home, and my own name, so that thou
        mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant between us. If I spend no

        knockest." "Gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and his axe he
        brandishes.

        The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his head,
        lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck for
        the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high, let it
        fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from the body.
        The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many turned it aside
        with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst from the body, yet
        the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he started forth on stiff
        shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his head, and lifted it up
        quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle he catches, steps into
        his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the hair he holds in his
        hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no mishap had ailed him,
        though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned his ugly trunk about—that
        ugly body that bled,—and holding the head in his hand, he directed
        the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The head lifted up its
        eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with its mouth as ye may
        now hear:

        knights. Get thee to the Green Chapel, I charge thee, to fetch such a
        dint as thou hast dealt, to be returned on New Year's morn. As the
        Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou seekest
        thou canst not fail to find me. Therefore come, or recreant be called."
        With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the hall-door, his
        head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew from the hoofs of
        his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none there, nor knew they
        from whence he had come. What then?

        look upon it, and "by true title thereof tell the wonder." Then all the
        knights hastened to their seats at the table, so did the king and our

        beginning is seldom like the end; wherefore this Christmas passed away
        and the year after, and each season in turn followed after another (ll.

        wearisome journey (ll. 521-535). On All-hallows day Arthur entertains
        right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew,
        for whom all courteous knights and lovely ladies were in great grief.
        Nevertheless they spoke only of mirth, and, though joyless themselves,
        made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne (ll. 536-565). Early on
        the morrow Sir Gawayne, with great ceremony, is arrayed in his armour
        (ll. 566-589), and thus completely equipped for his adventure he first
        hears mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur, the knights of the
        Round Table, and the lords and ladies of the court, who kiss him and
        commend him to Christ. He bids them all good day, as he thought, for

        Now rides our knight through the realms of England with no companion but
        his foal, and no one to hold converse with save God alone. From Camelot,
        in Somersetshire, he proceeds through Gloucestershire and the adjoining
        counties into Montgomeryshire, and thence through North Wales to
        Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from which he
        passes into the very narrow peninsula of Wirral, in Cheshire, where
        dwelt but few that loved God or man. Gawayne enquires after the Green
        Knight of the Green Chapel, but all the inhabitants declare that they
        have never seen "any man of such hues of green."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>
        The knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths, over hill and
        moor, encountering on his way not only serpents, wolves, bulls, bears,
        and boars, but wood satyrs and giants. But worse than all those,
        however, was the sharp winter, "when the cold clear water shed from the
        clouds, and froze ere it might fall to the earth. Nearly slain with the
        sleet he slept in his armour, more nights than enough, in naked rocks"
        (ll. 701-729).

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until Christmas-eve, and
        to Mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to some abode. On the
        morn he arrives at an immense forest, wondrously wild, surrounded by
        high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full huge, a hundred
        together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were all overgrown
        with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped
        for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and Mary to guide him to
        some habitation where he might hear mass (ll. 730-762). Scarcely had he
        crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a dwelling in the wood set
        upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld. It was
        pitched on a prairie, with a park all about it, enclosing many a tree
        for more than two miles. It shone as the sun through the bright oaks
        (ll. 763-772).

        Gawayne urges on his steed Gringolet, and finds himself at the "chief

        The drawbridge is soon let down, and the gates opened wide to receive
        the knight. Many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome (ll. 773-825).
        They take away his helmet, sword, and shield, and many a proud one
        presses forward to do him honour. They bring him into the hall, where a
        fire was brightly burning upon the hearth. Then the lord of the land<sup>1</sup>
        comes from his chamber and welcomes Sir Gawayne, telling him that he is
        to consider the place as his own. Our knight is next conducted to a
        bright bower, where was noble bedding—curtains of pure silk, with
        golden hems, and Tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the floors (ll.
        826-859). Here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes, which
        so well became him, that all declared that a more comely knight Christ
        had never made (ll. 860-883).

        A table is soon raised, and Gawayne, having washed, proceeds to meat.
        Many dishes are set before him—"sews" of various kinds, fish of
        all kinds, some baked in bread, others broiled on the embers, some
        boiled, and others seasoned with spices. The knight expresses himself
        well pleased, and calls it a most noble and princely feast.

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After dinner, in reply to numerous questions, he tells his host that he
        is Gawayne, one of the Knights of the Round Table. When this was made
        known great was the joy in the hall. Each one said softly to his
        companion, "Now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of
        noble discourse, since we have amongst us 'that fine father of nurture.'
        Truly God has highly favoured us in sending us such a noble guest as Sir
        Gawayne" (ll. 884-927). At the end of the Christmas festival Gawayne
        desires to take his departure from the castle, but his host persuades
        him to stay, promising to direct him to the Green Chapel (about two
        miles from the castle), that he may be there by the appointed time (ll.
        1029-1082).

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        A covenant is made between them, the terms of which were that the lord
        of the castle should go out early to the chase, that Gawayne meanwhile
        should lie in his loft at his ease, then rise at his usual hour, and
        afterwards sit at table with his hostess, and that at the end of the day
        they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in the
        interim. "Whatever I win in the wood," says the lord, "shall be yours,
        and what thou gettest shall be mine" (ll. 1083-1125).

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Full early before daybreak the folk uprise, saddle their horses, and
        truss their mails. The noble lord of the land, arrayed for riding, eats
        hastily a sop, and having heard mass, proceeds with a hundred hunters to
        hunt the wild deer (ll. 1126-1177).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        All this time Gawayne lies in his gay bed. His nap is disturbed by a
        little noise at the door, which is softly opened. He heaves up his head
        out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains, beholds a most
        lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the bed, and the
        knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep. The lady
        stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her softly on
        the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should awake. After
        lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant, Gawayne
        unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at the same time
        making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden danger (ll.
        1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are a careless
        sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed, of that be
        ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according to your
        will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the more
        comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet one,
        "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight I
        shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
        the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised.
        Now ye are here, and we are alone (my lord and his men being afar off,
        other men, too, are in bed, so are my maidens), and the door is safely
        closed, I shall use my time well while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my
        person to do with it as ye please, and I will be your servant" (ll.
        1208-1240).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne behaves most discreetly, for the remembrance of his forthcoming
        adventure at the Green Chapel prevents him from thinking of love (ll.
        1205-1289). At last the lady takes leave of the knight by catching him
        in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes away
        merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase. He
        presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
        between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of good
        fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says the
        other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won such
        bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies Gawayne,
        "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they proceed to
        supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being carried round,
        Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at night they take
        leave of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the time that the cock
        had crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and after "meat and
        mass" were over the hunters make for the woods, where they give chase to
        a wild boar who had grown old and mischievous (ll. 1395-1467).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        While the sportsmen are hunting this "wild swine" our lovely knight lies
        in his bed. He is not forgotten by the lady, who pays him an early
        visit, seeking to make further trial of his virtues. She sits softly by
        his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day
        before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she; "that
        becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take that
        which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough to
        enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given
        with a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is
        that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a
        knight, has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought,"
        she says, "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of
        true-love's crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you
        some game; do teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne
        replies that he cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and
        tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus did
        our knight avoid all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to do
        what was wrong (ll. 1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses
        upon Sir Gawayne, takes her leave of him (ll. 1553-1557).

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        At the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home with the
        shields and head of the wild boar. He shows them to his guest, who
        declares that "such a brawn of a beast, nor such sides of a swine," he
        never before has seen. Gawayne takes possession of the spoil according
        to covenant, and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host, who
        declares that his guest has indeed been rich with "such chaffer" (ll.
        1558-1647).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After much persuasion, Gawayne consents to stop at the castle another
        day (ll. 1648-1685). Early on the morrow the lord and his men hasten to
        the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of which
        affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730). Meanwhile
        our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He is again
        visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and so
        "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
        Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
        soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
        would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
        one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
        traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to whom
        he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he neither
        has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for sorrow, and
        telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift, if it were
        only a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and lessen her
        grief" (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy
        of her acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand," and therefore has
        "no men with no mails containing precious things," for which he is truly
        sorry.

        not be beholden to me, I shall give you my girdle that is less valuable"
        (ll. 1801-1835). But Gawayne replies that he will not accept gold or

        or slain by any man under heaven." The knight thinks awhile, and it
        strikes him that this would be a "jewel for the jeopardy" that he had to
        undergo at the Green Chapel. So he not only accepts the lace, but
        promises to keep the possession of it a secret (ll. 1836-1865). By that

        solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy (ll.

        slain the fox, returns to his "dear home," where he finds a fire
        brightly turning and his guest amusing the ladies (ll. 1893-1927).
        Gawayne, in fulfilment of his agreement, kisses his host thrice.<sup>1</sup>
        "By Christ," quoth the other knight, "ye have caught much bliss. I have
        hunted all this day and nought have I got but the skin of this foul fox

        and before day-break he calls for his chamberlain, who quickly brings
        him his armour (ll. 1952-2014). While Gawayne clothed himself in his
        rich weeds he forgot not the "lace, the lady's gift," but with it doubly
        girded his loins. He wore it not for its rich ornaments, "but to save

        The drawbridge is let down, and the broad gates unbarred and borne open
        upon both sides, and the knight, after commending the castle to Christ,
        passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide, that
        should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the
        much-dreaded blow. They climb over cliffs, where each hill had a hat and
        a mist-cloak, until the next morn, when they find themselves on a full
        high hill covered with snow. The servant bids his master remain awhile,
        saying, "I have brought you hither at this time, and now ye are not far
        from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after. The place
        that ye press to is esteemed full perilous, and there dwells a man in
        that waste the worst upon earth, for he is stiff and stern and loves to
        strike, and greater is he than any man upon middle-earth, and his body
        is bigger than the best four in Arthur's house. He keeps the Green
        Chapel; there passes none by that place, however proud in arms, that he
        does not 'ding him to death with dint of his hand.' He is a man
        immoderate and 'no mercy uses,' for be it churl or chaplain that by the
        chapel rides, monk or mass-priest, or any man else, it is as pleasant to
        him to kill them as to go alive himself. Wherefore I tell thee truly,
        'come ye there, ye be killed, though ye had twenty lives to spend. He
        has dwelt there long of yore, and on field much sorrow has wrought.
        Against his sore dints ye may not defend you' (ll. 2069-2117).
        Therefore, good Sir Gawayne, let the man alone, and for God's sake go by
        some other path, and then I shall hie me home again. I swear to you by

        Gawayne thanks his guide for his well-meant kindness, but declares that

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Mary!" quoth the other, "since it pleases thee to lose thy life I will
        not hinder thee. Have thy helmet on thy head, thy spear in thy hand, and
        ride down this path by yon rock-side, till thou be brought to the bottom
        of the valley. Then look a little on the plain, on thy left hand, and
        thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself, and the burly knight
        that guards it (ll. 2118-2148). Now, farewell Gawayne the noble! for all
        the gold upon ground I would not go with thee nor bear thee fellowship
        through this wood 'on foot farther.'" Thus having spoken, he gallops
        away and leaves the knight alone.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne now pursues his journey, rides through the dale, and looks
        about. He sees no signs of a resting-place, but only high and steep
        banks, and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and distorted.
        No chapel, however, could he discover. After a while he sees a round
        hill by the side of a stream; thither he goes, alights, and fastens his
        horse to the branch of a tree. He walks about the hill, debating with
        himself what it might be. It had a hole in the one end and on each side,
        and everywhere overgrown with grass, but whether it was only an old cave
        or a crevice of an old crag he could not tell (ll. 2149-2188).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory is ugly
        with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green to
        'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is the
        fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that he
        may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune—evil betide it! It
        is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
        head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
        from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
        clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
        scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
        terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise
        shall cause me to fear."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse with me to
        hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave wight will
        hie him hither, either now or never" (ll. 2189-2216).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Abide," quoth one on the bank above, over his head, "and thou shalt
        have all in haste that I promised thee once."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell weapon a Danish
        axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at first as his legs,
        locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on the earth. When he
        reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides about. He meets Sir
        Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to fulfil his part of the
        compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man), "may God preserve
        thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou hast timed thy
        travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants made between
        us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I should return
        thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
        please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
        'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou didst
        strike off my head with a single blow."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy will for
        any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
        The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force raises
        it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe came gliding
        down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp iron."
        The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with many
        proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed, that never
        feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for fear
        before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that knight
        did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim at me in
        King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never fled,
        wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
        fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
        destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a stroke and
        start no more until thine axe has hit me—have here my troth."
        "Have at thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and
        looks as savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily, but
        withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
        without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
        fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy heart whole
        it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne answers with
        great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest too long; I
        believe thy own heart fails thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly, I will no
        longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and brow,"
        he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of Sir
        Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
        causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
        quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out
        his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid
        me no more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
        but if thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be
        thou sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now cease."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne, as bold and
        fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
        knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee (ll.
        2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold thee
        well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused thee
        much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my fair
        wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me
        according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and therefore I
        have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my own wife,
        belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and the wooing
        of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee, and truly
        methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went. Still,
        sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from no
        immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less I
        blame thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
        within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
        covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
        Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
        cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight, laughing, thus
        spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults, that
        I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast first
        born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
        adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall enjoy
        together the festivities of the New Year" (ll. 2340-2406).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may God
        requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who with
        her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man to
        come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with one,
        and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
        suffered much through Bathsheba. <i>'It were indeed great bliss for a
        man to love them well and believe them not.'</i> Since the greatest upon
        earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God reward you
        for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my fault, and
        when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall lessen it (ll.
        2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land, from whom I have
        received so much honour, tell me truly your right name, and I shall ask
        no more questions."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of
        Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of Merlin,
        who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall for to
        essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to bereave
        you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and affrighted her to
        death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand before
        the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half sister; wherefore
        come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with many
        embraces and kind wishes, they separate—the one to his castle, the
        other to Arthur's court.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the wound
        in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of King
        Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss their
        brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells them
        of his adventures, hiding nothing—"the chance of the chapel, the
        cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
        Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which he
        had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and his
        courtiers comfort the knight—they laugh loudly at his adventures,
        and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
        Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear a
        bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was conferred
        honoured it evermore after.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the "Brutus Books"
        bear witness (ll. 2505-2530).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
      I need not say that the <i>Brutus Books</i> we possess do not contain the
      legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than some of
      the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know the
      relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original Arthur
      legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to his
      edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
      different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance writers.
    </p>
<p>
      Into this and other <i>literary</i> questions I do not enter here, as I
      have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of the
      Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be found
      noticed in the Notes and Glossary.
    </p>
<p>
      As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the
      Early English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of
      its contents before the original shall be no longer legible.
    </p>
<p>
      We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to
      a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of Early
      English minds.

          South Cadbury, in Somersetshire (Sir F. Madden).

              As all were fallen asleep so ceased their

          of <i>slaked hor lote3</i>, which, according to his glossary,
          signifies drunken vagabonds. He evidently takes <i>horlote3</i> to be
          another (and a very uncommon) form of <i>harlote3</i> = <i>harlots</i>.
          But <i>harlot</i>, or vagabond, would be a very inappropriate term to
          apply to the noble <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>. Moreover, <i>slaked</i>
          never, I think, means drunken. The general sense of the verb <i>slake</i>
          is to let loose, lessen, cease. Cf. lines 411-2, where <i>sloke</i>,
          another form of <i>slake</i>, occurs with a similar meaning:<br>
              — <i>layt no fyrre; bot slokes</i>.<br>
              — seek no further, but stop (cease).<br>
          Sir F. Madden suggests <i>blows</i> as the explanation of <i>slokes</i>.
          It is, however, a <i>verb</i> in the imperative mood.

      PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
    </h2>
<p>
      In re-editing the present romance-poem I have been saved all labour of
      transcription by using the very accurate text contained in Sir F. Madden's
      "Syr Gawayne."
    </p>
<p>
      I have not only read his copy with the manuscript, but also the
      proof-sheets as they came to hand, hoping by this means to give the reader
      a text free from any errors of transcription.
    </p>
<p>
      The present edition differs from that of the earlier one in having the
      contractions of the manuscript expanded and side-notes added to the text
      to enable the reader to follow with some degree of ease the author's
      pleasant narrative of Sir Gawayne's adventures.
    </p>
<p>
      The Glossary is taken from Sir F. Madden's "Syr Gawayne,"<sup>1</sup> to
      which, for the better interpretation of the text, I have made several
      additions, and have, moreover, glossed nearly all the words previously
      left unexplained.
    </p>
<p>
      For a description of the Manuscript, and particulars relating to the
      authorship and dialect of the present work, the reader is referred to the

<h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
<p>
      No Knight of the Round Table has been so highly honoured by the old
      Romance-writers as Sir Gawayne, the son of Loth, and nephew to the
      renowned Arthur. They delighted to describe him as Gawayne the good, a man
      matchless on mould, the most gracious that under God lived, the hardiest
      of hand, the most fortunate in arms, and the most polite in hall, whose
      knowledge, knighthood, kindly works, doings, doughtiness, and deeds of
      arms were known in all lands.
    </p>
<p>
      When Arthur beheld the dead body of his kinsman lying on the ground bathed
      in blood, he is said to have exclaimed, "O righteous God, this blood were
      worthy to be preserved and enshrined in gold!" Our author, too, loves to
      speak of his hero in similar terms of praise, calling him the knight
      faultless in his five wits, void of every offence, and adorned with every
      earthly virtue. He represents him as one whose trust was in the five
      wounds, and in whom the five virtues which distinguished the true knight
      were more firmly established than in any other on earth.
    </p>
<p>
      The author of the present story, who, as we know from his religious poems,
      had an utter horror of moral impurity, could have chosen no better subject
      for a romance in which amusement and moral instruction were to be
      combined. In the following tale he shows how the true knight, though
      tempted sorely not once alone, but twice, nay thrice, breaks not his vow
      of chastity, but turns aside the tempter's shafts with the shield of
      purity and arm of faith, and so passes scatheless through the perilous
      defile of trial and opportunity seeming safe.
    </p>
<p>
      But while our author has borrowed many of the details of his story from
      the "Roman de Perceval" by Chrestien de Troyes, he has made the narrative
      more attractive by the introduction of several original and highly
      interesting passages which throw light on the manners and amusements of
      our ancestors.
    </p>
<p>
      The following elaborate descriptions are well deserving of especial
      notice:—
    </p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        I. The mode of completely arming a knight (ll. 568-589).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        II. The hunting and breaking the deer (ll. 1126-1359).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        III. The hunting and unlacing the wild boar (ll. 1412-1614).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        IV. A fox hunt (ll. 1675-1921).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
      The following is an outline of the story of Gawayne's adventures, more or
      less in the words of the writer himself:—
    </p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Arthur, the greatest of Britain's kings, holds the Christmas festival at
        Camelot, surrounded by the celebrated knights of the Round Table, noble
        lords, the most renowned under heaven, and ladies the loveliest that
        ever had life (ll. 37-57). This noble company celebrate the New Year by
        a religious service, by the bestowal of gifts, and the most joyous
        mirth. Lords and ladies take their seats at the table—Queen
        Guenever, the grey-eyed, gaily dressed, sits at the daïs, the high
        table, or table of state, where too sat Gawayne and Ywain together with
        other worthies of the Round Table (ll. 58-84, 107-115). Arthur, in mood
        as joyful as a child, his blood young and his brain wild, declares that
        he will not eat nor sit long at the table until some adventurous thing,
        some uncouth tale, some great marvel, or some encounter of arms has
        occurred to mark the return of the New Year (ll. 85-106).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The first course was announced with cracking of trumpets, with the noise
        of nakers and noble pipes.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          "Each two had dishes twelve,
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Good beer and bright wine both."
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Scarcely was the first course served when another noise than that of
        music was heard. There rushes in at the hall-door a knight of gigantic
        stature—the greatest on earth—in measure high. He was
        clothed entirely in green, and rode upon a green foal (ll. 116-178).
        Fair wavy hair fell about the shoulders of the Green Knight, and a great
        beard like a bush hung upon his breast (ll. 179-202).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The knight carried no helmet, shield, or spear, but in one hand a holly
        bough, and in the other an axe "huge and unmeet," the edge of which was
        as keen as a sharp razor (ll. 203-220). Thus arrayed, the Green Knight
        enters the hall without saluting any one. The first word that he uttered
        was, "Where is the govenour of this gang? gladly would I see him and
        with himself speak reason." To the knights he cast his eye, looking for
        the most renowned. Much did the noble assembly marvel to see a man and a
        horse of such a hue, green as the grass. Even greener they seemed than
        green enamel on bright gold. Many marvels had they seen, but none such
        as this. They were afraid to answer, but sat stone-still in a dead
        silence, as if overpowered by sleep;
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          "Not all from fear, but some for courtesy" (ll. 221-249).
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then Arthur before the high daïs salutes the Green Knight, bids him
        welcome, and entreats him to stay awhile at his Court. The knight says
        that his errand is not to abide in any dwelling, but to seek the most
        valiant of the heroes of the Round Table that he may put his courage to
        the proof, and thus satisfy himself as to the fame of Arthur's court. "I
        come," he says, "in peace, as ye may see by this branch that I bear
        here. Had I come with hostile intentions, I should not have left my
        hauberk, helmet, shield, sharp spear, and other weapons behind me. But
        because I desire no war, 'my weeds are softer.' If thou be so bold as
        all men say, thou wilt grant me the request I am about to make." "Sir
        courteous knight," replies Arthur, "if thou cravest battle only, here
        failest thou not to fight." "Nay," says the Green Knight, "I seek no
        fighting. Here about on this bench are only beardless children. Were I
        arrayed in arms on a high steed no man here would be a match for me (ll.
        250-282). But it is now Christmas time, and this is the New Year, and I
        see around me many brave ones;—if any be so bold in his blood that
        dare strike a stroke for another, I shall give him this rich axe to do
        with it whatever he pleases. I shall abide the first blow just as I sit,
        and will stand him a stroke, stiff on this floor, provided that I deal
        him another in return.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
          And yet give I him respite,
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          A twelvemonth and a day;
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Now haste and let see tite (soon)
        </p>
<p class="i4">
          Dare any here-in ought say.'"
        </p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        If he astounded them at first, much more so did he after this speech,
        and fear held them all silent. The knight, righting himself in his
        saddle, rolls fiercely his red eyes about, bends his bristly green
        brows, and strokes his beard awaiting a reply. But finding none that
        would carp with him, he exclaims, "What! is this Arthur's house, the
        fame of which has spread through so many realms? Forsooth, the renown of
        the Round Table is overturned by the word of one man's speech, for all
        tremble for dread without a blow being struck!" (ll. 283-313). With this
        he laughed so loud that Arthur blushed for very shame, and waxed as
        wroth as the wind. "I know no man," he says, "that is aghast at thy
        great words. Give me now thy axe and I will grant thee thy request!"
        Arthur seizes the axe, grasps the handle, and sternly brandishes it
        about, while the Green Knight, with a stern cheer and a dry countenance,
        stroking his beard and drawing down his coat, awaits the blow (ll.
        314-335). Sir Gawayne, the nephew of the king, beseeches his uncle to
        let him undertake the encounter; and, at the earnest entreaty of his
        nobles, Arthur consents "to give Gawayne the game" (ll. 336-365).

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Sir Gawayne then takes possession of the axe, but, before the blow is
        dealt, the Green Knight asks the name of his opponent. "In good faith,"
        answers the good knight, "Gawayne I am called, that bids thee to this
        buffet, whatever may befall after, and at this time twelvemonth will
        take from thee another, with whatever weapon thou wilt, and with no
        wight else alive." "By Gog," quoth the Green Knight, "it pleases me well
        that I shall receive at thy fist that which I have sought here—moreover
        thou hast truly rehearsed the terms of the covenant,—but thou
        shalt first pledge me thy word that thou wilt seek me thyself,
        wheresoever on earth thou believest I may be found, and fetch thee such
        wages as thou dealest me to-day before this company of doughty ones."
        "Where should I seek thee?" replies Gawayne, "where is thy place? I know
        not thee, thy court, or thy name. I wot not where thou dwellest, but
        teach me thereto, tell me how thou art called, and I shall endeavour to
        find thee,—and that I swear thee for truth and by my sure troth."
        "That is enough in New Year," says the groom in green, "if I tell thee
        when I have received the tap. When thou hast smitten me, then smartly I
        will teach thee of my house, my home, and my own name, so that thou
        mayest follow my track and fulfil the covenant between us. If I spend no
        speech, then speedest thou the better, for then mayest thou remain in
        thy own land and seek no further; but cease thy talking<sup>1</sup> (ll.
        366-412). Take now thy grim tool to thee and let us see how thou
        knockest." "Gladly, sir, for sooth," quoth Gawayne, and his axe he
        brandishes.

        The Green Knight adjusts himself on the ground, bends slightly his head,
        lays his long lovely locks over his crown, and lays bare his neck for
        the blow. Gawayne then gripped the axe, and, raising it on high, let it
        fall quickly upon the knight's neck and severed the head from the body.
        The fair head fell from the neck to the earth, and many turned it aside
        with their feet as it rolled forth. The blood burst from the body, yet
        the knight never faltered nor fell; but boldly he started forth on stiff
        shanks and fiercely rushed forward, seized his head, and lifted it up
        quickly. Then he runs to his horse, the bridle he catches, steps into
        his stirrups and strides aloft. His head by the hair he holds in his
        hands, and sits as firmly in his saddle as if no mishap had ailed him,
        though headless he was (ll. 413-439). He turned his ugly trunk about—that
        ugly body that bled,—and holding the head in his hand, he directed
        the face toward the "dearest on the dais." The head lifted up its
        eyelids and looked abroad, and thus much spoke with its mouth as ye may
        now hear:

        Knight of the Green Chapel I am known to many, wherefore if thou seekest

        With a fierce start the reins he turns, rushes out of the hall-door, his
        head in his hand, so that the fire of the flint flew from the hoofs of
        his foal. To what kingdom he belonged knew none there, nor knew they

        right nobly the lords and ladies of his court in honour of his nephew,

        made many a joke to cheer the good Sir Gawayne (ll. 536-565). Early on

        (ll. 566-589), and thus completely equipped for his adventure he first
        hears mass, and afterwards takes leave of Arthur, the knights of the
        Round Table, and the lords and ladies of the court, who kiss him and
        commend him to Christ. He bids them all good day, as he thought, for

        Now rides our knight through the realms of England with no companion but
        his foal, and no one to hold converse with save God alone. From Camelot,
        in Somersetshire, he proceeds through Gloucestershire and the adjoining
        counties into Montgomeryshire, and thence through North Wales to
        Holyhead, adjoining the Isle of Anglesea (ll. 670-700), from which he
        passes into the very narrow peninsula of Wirral, in Cheshire, where
        dwelt but few that loved God or man. Gawayne enquires after the Green
        Knight of the Green Chapel, but all the inhabitants declare that they
        have never seen "any man of such hues of green."

        The knight thence pursues his journey by strange paths, over hill and
        moor, encountering on his way not only serpents, wolves, bulls, bears,
        and boars, but wood satyrs and giants. But worse than all those,
        however, was the sharp winter, "when the cold clear water shed from the
        clouds, and froze ere it might fall to the earth. Nearly slain with the
        sleet he slept in his armour, more nights than enough, in naked rocks"
        (ll. 701-729).

<p>
        Thus in peril and plight the knight travels on until Christmas-eve, and
        to Mary he makes his moan that she may direct him to some abode. On the
        morn he arrives at an immense forest, wondrously wild, surrounded by
        high hills on every side, where he found hoary oaks full huge, a hundred
        together. The hazel and the hawthorn intermingled were all overgrown
        with moss, and upon their boughs sat many sad birds that piteously piped
        for pain of the cold. Gawayne besought the Lord and Mary to guide him to
        some habitation where he might hear mass (ll. 730-762). Scarcely had he
        crossed himself thrice, when he perceived a dwelling in the wood set
        upon a hill. It was the loveliest castle he had ever beheld. It was
        pitched on a prairie, with a park all about it, enclosing many a tree
        for more than two miles. It shone as the sun through the bright oaks
        (ll. 763-772).

        The drawbridge is soon let down, and the gates opened wide to receive
        the knight. Many noble ones hasten to bid him welcome (ll. 773-825).
        They take away his helmet, sword, and shield, and many a proud one
        presses forward to do him honour. They bring him into the hall, where a
        fire was brightly burning upon the hearth. Then the lord of the land<sup>1</sup>
        comes from his chamber and welcomes Sir Gawayne, telling him that he is
        to consider the place as his own. Our knight is next conducted to a
        bright bower, where was noble bedding—curtains of pure silk, with
        golden hems, and Tarsic tapestries upon the walls and the floors (ll.
        826-859). Here the knight doffed his armour and put on rich robes, which
        so well became him, that all declared that a more comely knight Christ
        had never made (ll. 860-883).

        A table is soon raised, and Gawayne, having washed, proceeds to meat.

        all kinds, some baked in bread, others broiled on the embers, some
        boiled, and others seasoned with spices. The knight expresses himself
        well pleased, and calls it a most noble and princely feast.

        After dinner, in reply to numerous questions, he tells his host that he
        is Gawayne, one of the Knights of the Round Table. When this was made
        known great was the joy in the hall. Each one said softly to his
        companion, "Now we shall see courteous behaviour and learn the terms of
        noble discourse, since we have amongst us 'that fine father of nurture.'
        Truly God has highly favoured us in sending us such a noble guest as Sir
        Gawayne" (ll. 884-927). At the end of the Christmas festival Gawayne
        desires to take his departure from the castle, but his host persuades
        him to stay, promising to direct him to the Green Chapel (about two
        miles from the castle), that he may be there by the appointed time (ll.
        1029-1082).

        A covenant is made between them, the terms of which were that the lord

        should lie in his loft at his ease, then rise at his usual hour, and
        afterwards sit at table with his hostess, and that at the end of the day
        they should make an exchange of whatever they might obtain in the
        interim. "Whatever I win in the wood," says the lord, "shall be yours,
        and what thou gettest shall be mine" (ll. 1083-1125).

<blockquote><div>

        Full early before daybreak the folk uprise, saddle their horses, and
        truss their mails. The noble lord of the land, arrayed for riding, eats
        hastily a sop, and having heard mass, proceeds with a hundred hunters to
        hunt the wild deer (ll. 1126-1177).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        All this time Gawayne lies in his gay bed. His nap is disturbed by a
        little noise at the door, which is softly opened. He heaves up his head
        out of the clothes, and, peeping through the curtains, beholds a most
        lovely lady (the wife of his host). She came towards the bed, and the
        knight laid himself down quickly, pretending to be asleep. The lady
        stole to the bed, cast up the curtains, crept within, sat her softly on
        the bed-side, and waited some time till the knight should awake. After
        lurking awhile under the clothes considering what it all meant, Gawayne
        unlocked his eyelids, and put on a look of surprise, at the same time
        making the sign of the cross, as if afraid of some hidden danger (ll.
        1178-1207). "Good morrow, sir," said that fair lady, "ye are a careless
        sleeper to let one enter thus. I shall bind you in your bed, of that be
        ye sure." "Good morrow," quoth Gawayne, "I shall act according to your
        will with great pleasure, but permit me to rise that I may the more
        comfortably converse with you." "Nay, beau sir," said that sweet one,
        "ye shall not rise from your bed, for since I have caught my knight I
        shall hold talk with him. I ween well that ye are Sir Gawayne that all
        the world worships, whose honour and courtesy are so greatly praised.
        Now ye are here, and we are alone (my lord and his men being afar off,
        other men, too, are in bed, so are my maidens), and the door is safely
        closed, I shall use my time well while it lasts. Ye are welcome to my
        person to do with it as ye please, and I will be your servant" (ll.
        1208-1240).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne behaves most discreetly, for the remembrance of his forthcoming
        adventure at the Green Chapel prevents him from thinking of love (ll.
        1205-1289). At last the lady takes leave of the knight by catching him
        in her arms and kissing him (ll. 1290-1307). The day passes away
        merrily, and at dusk the Lord of the castle returns from the chase. He
        presents the venison to Gawayne according to the previous covenant
        between them. Our knight gives his host a kiss as the only piece of good
        fortune that had fallen to him during the day. "It is good," says the
        other, "and would be much better if ye would tell me where ye won such
        bliss" (ll. 1308-1394). "That was not in our covenant," replies Gawayne,
        "so try me no more." After much laughing on both sides they proceed to
        supper, and afterwards, while the choice wine is being carried round,
        Gawayne and his host renew their agreement. Late at night they take
        leave of each other and hasten to their beds. "By the time that the cock
        had crowed and cackled thrice" the lord was up, and after "meat and
        mass" were over the hunters make for the woods, where they give chase to
        a wild boar who had grown old and mischievous (ll. 1395-1467).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        While the sportsmen are hunting this "wild swine" our lovely knight lies
        in his bed. He is not forgotten by the lady, who pays him an early
        visit, seeking to make further trial of his virtues. She sits softly by
        his side and tells him that he has forgotten what she taught him the day
        before (ll. 1468-1486). "I taught you of kissing," says she; "that
        becomes every courteous knight." Gawayne says that he must not take that
        which is forbidden him. The lady replies that he is strong enough to
        enforce his own wishes. Our knight answers that every gift not given
        with a good will is worthless. His fair visitor then enquires how it is
        that he who is so skilled in the true sport of love and so renowned a
        knight, has never talked to her of love (ll. 1487-1524). "You ought,"
        she says, "to show and teach a young thing like me some tokens of
        true-love's crafts; I come hither and sit here alone to learn of you
        some game; do teach me of your wit while my lord is from home." Gawayne
        replies that he cannot undertake the task of expounding true-love and
        tales of arms to one who has far more wisdom than he possesses. Thus did
        our knight avoid all appearance of evil, though sorely pressed to do
        what was wrong (ll. 1525-1552). The lady, having bestowed two kisses
        upon Sir Gawayne, takes her leave of him (ll. 1553-1557).

<blockquote><div>
<p>
        At the end of the day the lord of the castle returns home with the
        shields and head of the wild boar. He shows them to his guest, who
        declares that "such a brawn of a beast, nor such sides of a swine," he
        never before has seen. Gawayne takes possession of the spoil according
        to covenant, and in return he bestows two kisses upon his host, who
        declares that his guest has indeed been rich with "such chaffer" (ll.
        1558-1647).

</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After much persuasion, Gawayne consents to stop at the castle another
        day (ll. 1648-1685). Early on the morrow the lord and his men hasten to
        the woods, and come upon the track of a fox, the hunting of which
        affords them plenty of employment and sport (ll. 1686-1730). Meanwhile
        our good knight sleeps soundly within his comely curtains. He is again
        visited by the lady of the castle. So gaily was she attired, and so
        "faultless of her features," that great joy warmed the heart of Sir
        Gawayne. With soft and pleasant smiles "they smite into mirth," and are
        soon engaged in conversation. Had not Mary thought of her knight, he
        would have been in great peril (ll. 1731-1769). So sorely does the fair
        one press him with her love, that he fears lest he should become a
        traitor to his host. The lady enquires whether he has a mistress to whom
        he has plighted his troth. The knight swears by St John that he neither
        has nor desires one. This answer causes the dame to sigh for sorrow, and
        telling him that she must depart, she asks for some gift, if it were
        only a glove, by which she might "think on the knight and lessen her
        grief" (ll. 1770-1800). Gawayne assures her that he has nothing worthy
        of her acceptance; that he is on an "uncouth errand," and therefore has
        "no men with no mails containing precious things," for which he is truly
        sorry.

        undergo at the Green Chapel. So he not only accepts the lace, but
        promises to keep the possession of it a secret (ll. 1836-1865). By that

        solaces the ladies with comely carols and all kinds of joy (ll.
        1866-1892). The dark night came, and then the lord of the castle, having
        slain the fox, returns to his "dear home," where he finds a fire
        brightly turning and his guest amusing the ladies (ll. 1893-1927).
        Gawayne, in fulfilment of his agreement, kisses his host thrice.<sup>1</sup>
        "By Christ," quoth the other knight, "ye have caught much bliss. I have
        hunted all this day and nought have I got but the skin of this foul fox
        (the devil have the goods!), and that is full poor for to pay for such
        precious things" (ll. 1928-1951).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After the usual evening's entertainment, Gawayne retires to rest. The
        next morning, being New Year's day, is cold and stormy. Snow falls, and
        the dales are full of drift. Our knight in his bed locks his eyelids,
        but full little he sleeps. By each cock that crows he knows the hour,
        and before day-break he calls for his chamberlain, who quickly brings
        him his armour (ll. 1952-2014). While Gawayne clothed himself in his
        rich weeds he forgot not the "lace, the lady's gift," but with it doubly
        girded his loins. He wore it not for its rich ornaments, "but to save
        himself when it behoved him to suffer," and as a safeguard against sword
        or knife (ll. 2015-2046).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Having thanked his host and all the renowned assembly for the great
        kindness he had experienced at their hands, "he steps into stirrups and
        strides aloft" (ll. 2047-2068).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The drawbridge is let down, and the broad gates unbarred and borne open
        upon both sides, and the knight, after commending the castle to Christ,
        passes thereout and goes on his way accompanied by his guide, that
        should teach him to turn to that place where he should receive the
        much-dreaded blow. They climb over cliffs, where each hill had a hat and
        a mist-cloak, until the next morn, when they find themselves on a full
        high hill covered with snow. The servant bids his master remain awhile,
        saying, "I have brought you hither at this time, and now ye are not far
        from that noted place that ye have so often enquired after. The place
        that ye press to is esteemed full perilous, and there dwells a man in
        that waste the worst upon earth, for he is stiff and stern and loves to
        strike, and greater is he than any man upon middle-earth, and his body
        is bigger than the best four in Arthur's house. He keeps the Green
        Chapel; there passes none by that place, however proud in arms, that he
        does not 'ding him to death with dint of his hand.' He is a man
        immoderate and 'no mercy uses,' for be it churl or chaplain that by the
        chapel rides, monk or mass-priest, or any man else, it is as pleasant to
        him to kill them as to go alive himself. Wherefore I tell thee truly,
        'come ye there, ye be killed, though ye had twenty lives to spend. He
        has dwelt there long of yore, and on field much sorrow has wrought.
        Against his sore dints ye may not defend you' (ll. 2069-2117).
        Therefore, good Sir Gawayne, let the man alone, and for God's sake go by
        some other path, and then I shall hie me home again. I swear to you by
      </p>

<p>
        Gawayne thanks his guide for his well-meant kindness, but declares that
        to the Green Chapel he will go, though the owner thereof be "a stern
        knave," for God can devise means to save his servants.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Mary!" quoth the other, "since it pleases thee to lose thy life I will
        not hinder thee. Have thy helmet on thy head, thy spear in thy hand, and
        ride down this path by yon rock-side, till thou be brought to the bottom
        of the valley. Then look a little on the plain, on thy left hand, and
        thou shalt see in that slade the chapel itself, and the burly knight
        that guards it (ll. 2118-2148). Now, farewell Gawayne the noble! for all
        the gold upon ground I would not go with thee nor bear thee fellowship
        through this wood 'on foot farther.'" Thus having spoken, he gallops
        away and leaves the knight alone.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne now pursues his journey, rides through the dale, and looks
        about. He sees no signs of a resting-place, but only high and steep
        banks, and the very shadows of the high woods seemed wild and distorted.
        No chapel, however, could he discover. After a while he sees a round
        hill by the side of a stream; thither he goes, alights, and fastens his
        horse to the branch of a tree. He walks about the hill, debating with
        himself what it might be. It had a hole in the one end and on each side,
        and everywhere overgrown with grass, but whether it was only an old cave
        or a crevice of an old crag he could not tell (ll. 2149-2188).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Now, indeed," quoth Gawayne, "a desert is here; this oratory is ugly
        with herbs overgrown. It is a fitting place for the man in green to
        'deal here his devotions after the devil's manner.' Now I feel it is the
        fiend (the devil) in my five wits that has covenanted with me that he
        may destroy me. This is a chapel of misfortune—evil betide it! It
        is the most cursed kirk that ever I came in." With his helmet on his
        head, and spear in his hand, he roams up to the rock, and then he hears
        from that high hill beyond the brook a wondrous wild noise. Lo! it
        clattered in the cliff as if one upon a grindstone were grinding a
        scythe. It whirred like the water at a mill, and rushed and re-echoed,
        terrible to hear. "Though my life I forgo," says Gawayne, "no noise
        shall cause me to fear."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then he cried aloud, "Who dwells in this place, discourse with me to
        hold? For now is good Gawayne going right here if any brave wight will
        hie him hither, either now or never" (ll. 2189-2216).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Abide," quoth one on the bank above, over his head, "and thou shalt
        have all in haste that I promised thee once."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Soon there comes out of a hole in the crag, with a fell weapon a Danish
        axe quite new, the "man in the green," clothed as at first as his legs,
        locks and beard. But now he is on foot and walks on the earth. When he
        reaches the stream, he hops over and boldly strides about. He meets Sir
        Gawayne, who tells him that he is quite ready to fulfil his part of the
        compact. "Gawayne," quoth that 'green gome' (man), "may God preserve
        thee! Truly thou art welcome to my place, 'and thou hast timed thy
        travel' as a true man should. Thou knowest the covenants made between
        us, at this time twelve-month, that on New Year's day I should return
        thee thy blow. We are now in this valley by ourselves, and can do as we
        please (ll. 2217-2246). Have, therefore, thy helmet off thy head, and
        'have here thy pay.' Let us have no more talk than when thou didst
        strike off my head with a single blow."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Nay, by God!" quoth Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy will for
        any harm that may happen, but will stand still while thou strikest."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then he stoops a little and shows his bare neck, unmoved by any fear.
        The Green Knight takes up his "grim tool," and with all his force raises
        it aloft, as if he meant utterly to destroy him. As the axe came gliding
        down Gawayne "shrank a little with the shoulders from the sharp iron."
        The other withheld his weapon, and then reproved the prince with many
        proud words. "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed, that never
        feared for no host by hill nor by vale, for now thou fleest for fear
        before thou feelest harm (ll. 2247-2272). Such cowardice of that knight
        did I never hear. I never flinched nor fled when thou didst aim at me in
        King Arthur's house. My head flew to my feet and yet I never fled,
        wherefore I deserve to be called the better man."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Quoth Gawayne, "I shunted once, but will do so no more, though my head
        fall on the stones. But hasten and bring me to the point; deal me my
        destiny, and do it out of hand, for I shall stand thee a stroke and
        start no more until thine axe has hit me—have here my troth."
        "Have at thee, then," said the other, and heaves the axe aloft, and
        looks as savagely as if he were mad. He aims at the other mightily, but
        withholds his hand ere it might hurt. Gawayne readily abides the blow
        without flinching with any member, and stood still as a stone or a tree
        fixed in rocky ground with a hundred roots.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Then merrily the other did speak, "Since now thou hast thy heart whole
        it behoves me to strike, so take care of thy neck." Gawayne answers with
        great wroth, "Thrash on, thou fierce man, thou threatenest too long; I
        believe thy own heart fails thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Forsooth," quoth the other, "since thou speakest so boldly, I will no
        longer delay" (ll. 2273-2304). Then, contracting "both lips and brow,"
        he made ready to strike, and let fall his axe on the bare neck of Sir
        Gawayne. "Though he hammered" fiercely, he only "severed the hide,"
        causing the blood to flow. When Gawayne saw his blood on the snow, he
        quickly seized his helmet and placed it on his head. Then he drew out
        his bright sword, and thus angrily spoke: "Cease, man, of thy blow, bid
        me no more. I have received a stroke in this place without opposition,
        but if thou givest me any more readily shall I requite thee, of that be
        thou sure. Our covenant stipulates one stroke, and therefore now cease."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        The Green Knight, resting on his axe, looks on Sir Gawayne, as bold and
        fearless he there stood, and then with a loud voice thus addresses the
        knight: "Bold knight, be not so wroth, no man here has wronged thee (ll.
        2305-2339); I promised thee a stroke, and thou hast it, so hold thee
        well pleased. I could have dealt much worse with thee, and caused thee
        much sorrow. Two blows I aimed at thee, for twice thou kissedst my fair
        wife; but I struck thee not, because thou restoredst them to me
        according to agreement. At the third time thou failedst, and therefore I
        have given thee that tap. That woven girdle, given thee by my own wife,
        belongs to me. I know well thy kisses, thy conduct also, and the wooing
        of my wife, for I wrought it myself. I sent her to try thee, and truly
        methinks thou art the most faultless man that ever on foot went. Still,
        sir, thou wert wanting in good faith; but as it proceeded from no
        immorality, thou being only desirous of saving thy life, the less I
        blame thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne stood confounded, the blood rushed into his face, and he shrank
        within himself for very shame. "Cursed," he cried, "be cowardice and
        covetousness both; in you are villany and vice, that virtue destroy."
        Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight in green,
        cursing his cowardice and covetousness. The Green Knight, laughing, thus
        spoke: "Thou hast confessed so clean, and acknowledged thy faults, that
        I hold thee as pure as thou hadst never forfeited since thou wast first
        born. I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle as a token of thy
        adventure at the Green Chapel. Come now to my castle, and we shall enjoy
        together the festivities of the New Year" (ll. 2340-2406).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        "Nay, forsooth," quoth the knight, "but for your kindness may God
        requite you. Commend me to that courteous one your comely wife, who with
        her crafts has beguiled me. But it is no uncommon thing for a man to
        come to sorrow through women's wiles; for so was Adam beguiled with one,
        and Solomon with many. Samson was destroyed by Delilah, and David
        suffered much through Bathsheba. <i>'It were indeed great bliss for a
        man to love them well and believe them not.'</i> Since the greatest upon
        earth were so beguiled, methinks I should be excused. But God reward you
        for your girdle, which I will ever wear in remembrance of my fault, and
        when pride shall exalt me, a look to this love-lace shall lessen it (ll.
        2407-2438). But since ye are the lord of yonder land, from whom I have
        received so much honour, tell me truly your right name, and I shall ask
        no more questions."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Quoth the other, "I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of
        Morgain la Fay, who dwells in my house. Much has she learnt of Merlin,
        who knows all your knights at home. She brought me to your hall for to
        essay the prowess of the Round Table. She wrought this wonder to bereave
        you of your wits, hoping to have grieved Guenever and affrighted her to
        death by means of the man that spoke with his head in his hand before
        the high table. She is even thine aunt, Arthur's half sister; wherefore
        come to thine aunt, for all my household love thee."
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Gawayne refuses to accompany the Green Knight, and so, with many
        embraces and kind wishes, they separate—the one to his castle, the
        other to Arthur's court.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        After passing through many wild ways, our knight recovers from the wound
        in his neck, and at last comes safe and sound to the court of King
        Arthur. Great then was the joy of all; the king and queen kiss their
        brave knight, and make many enquiries about his journey. He tells them
        of his adventures, hiding nothing—"the chance of the chapel, the
        cheer of the knight, the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace."
        Groaning for grief and shame he shows them the cut in his neck, which he
        had received for his unfaithfulness (ll. 2439-2504). The king and his
        courtiers comfort the knight—they laugh loudly at his adventures,
        and unanimously agree that those lords and ladies that belonged to the
        Round Table, and each knight of the brotherhood should ever after wear a
        bright green belt for Gawayne's sake. And he upon whom it was conferred
        honoured it evermore after.
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>
<p>
        Thus in Arthur's time this adventure befell, whereof the "Brutus Books"
        bear witness (ll. 2505-2530).
      </p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
      I need not say that the <i>Brutus Books</i> we possess do not contain the
      legend here set forth, though it is not much more improbable than some of
      the statements contained in them. If the reader desires to know the
      relation in which this and the like stories stand to the original Arthur
      legends, he will find it discussed in Sir F. Madden's Preface to his
      edition of "Syr Gawayne," which also contains a sketch of the very
      different views taken of Sir Gawayne by the different Romance writers.
    </p>
<p>
      Into this and other <i>literary</i> questions I do not enter here, as I
      have nothing to add to Sir F. Madden's statements; but in the text of the
      Poem I have differed from him in some few readings, which will be found
      noticed in the Notes and Glossary.
    </p>
<p>
      As the manuscript is fast fading, I am glad that the existence of the
      Early English Text Society has enabled us to secure a wider diffusion of
      its contents before the original shall be no longer legible.
    </p>
<p>
      We want nothing but an increased supply of members to enable us to give to
      a large circle of readers many an equally interesting record of Early
      English minds.

              As all were fallen asleep so ceased their

          instead of <i>slaked hor loteȝ</i>, which, according to his
          glossary, signifies drunken vagabonds. He evidently takes <i>horloteȝ</i>
          to be another (and a very uncommon) form of <i>harloteȝ</i> = <i>harlots</i>.
          But <i>harlot</i>, or vagabond, would be a very inappropriate term to
          apply to the noble <i>Knights of the Round Table</i>. Moreover, <i>slaked</i>
          never, I think, means drunken. The general sense of the verb <i>slake</i>
          is to let loose, lessen, cease. Cf. lines 411-2, where <i>sloke</i>,
          another form of <i>slake</i>, occurs with a similar meaning:<br>
              — <i>layt no fyrre; bot slokes</i>.<br>
              — seek no further, but stop (cease).<br>
          Sir F. Madden suggests <i>blows</i> as the explanation of <i>slokes</i>.
          It is, however, a <i>verb</i> in the imperative mood.

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
