<h3>
THE CARRIER'S CART
</h3>
<p>
An old-fashioned carrier's cart, such as you may still meet
on the roads of Sussex, tilted, one-horsed, and moving at
the leisurely pace of a bye-gone age, turned East at the
Turnpike, and made slowly along the Lewes-Beachbourne
road under the northern scarp of the Downs one evening
of autumn in 1908.  In it, at the back of the driver, were a
young man and a young woman, the only passengers,
ensconced among hen-coops, flitches of bacon, and baskets
of greens.
</p>
<p>
They sat hand-in-hand.
</p>
<p>
The woman was a noble creature, about her the majestic
tranquillity of a great three-decker that comes to rest in
sunset waters after its Trafalgar.  The man, but for a
certain wistfulness about his eyes which betokened undue
sensibility, was not remarkable.  Till he spoke you would
have said he was a gentleman—that is to say if your eyes
confined their scrutiny to his face and refused to see his
hands, his boots, his clothes.  When he spoke you would
have recognised at once that he was Sussex of the soil as,
surely, was the woman beside him; though the speech of
both was faintly marred with the all-pervading cockney
accent of those who have passed beyond the village-green
into the larger world of the England of to-day.
</p>
<p>
Both ca-a-ad musically enough; but less by far than the
little carrier, whose round back blocked the view of the road,
and the twitching ears of old mare Jenny.  For nearly
fifty years, man and boy, Isaac Woolgar had travelled twice
a day, six days a week, the road on which he was travelling
now.  He had seen the long-horns—those "black runts"
so familiar to old-world Sussex—give place to horses in the
plough upon the hill; the horses in their turn supplanted on
the road by motors; and men using the legs God had given
them to trundle wheels instead of walk.  Undisturbed, he
plodded on his way, accompanied always by the wires
lifted on tall black poles, crowned with tiers of tiny porcelain
chimney-pots unknown in his youth, which had linked
Lewes with Beachbourne these forty years; and he would
so plod until he died.  The <i>Star</i> on the hill in Old Town,
Beachbourne, marked one end of his day's journey; and
the equally ancient <i>Lamb</i>, at Aldwoldston, black-timbered
and gabled too, marked the other.  He had never been
further "oop country," as he called it, than Heathfield.
Lewes was the utmost term of his wanderings West,
Beau-nez East; while the sea at Newhaven had bounded
him on the South.  Within this tiny quadrilateral, which
just about determined also the wanderings of an old dog-fox
in Abbot's Wood, he had passed his life; and nothing now
would ever induce him to pass the bounds he had allotted
himself.
</p>
<p>
To the man and woman in the cart old Mus. Woolgar
had been a familiar figure from childhood.  The little girl
skipping by the market-cross in Aldwoldston would stop to
watch him start; the little boy would wait at Billing's
Corner on the top of the hill to see him come along the New
Road past Motcombe at the end of his journey.  Long
before either had been aware of the other's existence the
old carrier had served as an invisible link between them.
</p>
<p>
Now the two were married.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Boam had become Mrs. Ernie Caspar that afternoon
in the cathedral-church of Aldwoldston, on the mound
among the ash-trees above Parsons' Tye and the long
donkey-backed clergy-house that dates from the fourteenth
century.
</p>
<p>
It had been a very quiet wedding.  The father and
mother of the bride had stumped across from Frogs' Hall,
at the foot of the village, Ruth accompanying them, her
little daughter in her arms.  For the rest, Dr. and
Mrs. Trupp had come over from Beachbourne with Mr. Pigott
and his wife in the chocolate-bodied car driven by the
bridegroom's brother.
</p>
<p>
Alf had not entered the church to see Ernie married.
He had mouched sullenly down to the river instead, and
stood there during the service, his back to the church,
looking across the Brooks to old Wind-hover's dun and shaven
flank with eyes that did not see, and ears that refused to
hear.
</p>
<p>
After the ceremony the car-party returned to Beachbourne
by way of the sea—climbing High-'nd-over, to drop
down into Sea-ford, and home by Birling Gap and Beau-nez.
From the almost violent gesture with which Alf had
set his engines in motion and drawn out of the lane under
the pollarded willows of Parson's Tye, he at least had been
glad to turn his back on the scene.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Ruth and her husband had returned to Frogs' Hall with
the old folk.
</p>
<p>
Later, as the sun began to lower behind Black Cap into
the valley of the Ouse, they went up River Lane and picked
up the carrier's cart by the market-cross.
</p>
<p>
For the moment they were leaving little Alice with her
grandmother while they settled into the Moot, Old Town,
where Ernie had found a cottage close to his work, not a
quarter of a mile from the home of his father and mother in
Rectory Walk.
</p>
<p>
The carrier's cart moved slowly on under the telegraph
wires on which the martins were already gathering: for
it was September.  Now and then Ernie raised the flap that
made a little window in the side of the tilt, and looked out
at the accompanying Downs, mysterious in the evening.
</p>
<p>
"They're still there," he announced comfortably,
"and like to be yet a bit, I reckon."
</p>
<p>
"They move much same pace as us doos, seems to me,"
said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"We should get there afoor them yet though," answered
Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"Afoor the Day of Judgment we might, if so be we
doosn't die o breathlessness first," the woman replied.
</p>
<p>
"You'd like a car to yourself you would," chaffed
Ernie.  "And Alf drivin you."
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned in her lips.
</p>
<p>
They moved leisurely forward, leaving Folkington
clustered about its village-green upon the right, passing the
tea-gardens at Wannock, and up the long pull to Willingdon,
standing among old gardens and pleasant fig-trees.  Once
through the village the woods of Hampden Park
green-bosomed upon the left, blocked out the marshes and
the splendid vision of Pevensey Bay.  Now the road
emerged from the shelter of hedges and elm-trees and
flowed with a noble billowy motion between seas of
corn that washed the foot of the Downs and swept
over Rodmill to the outposts of Beachbourne.  Between
the road and the Downs stood Motcombe, islanded
in the ruddy sea, amongst its elms and low piggeries.
Behind the farm, at the very foot of the hill, was
Huntsman's Lodge where once, when both were boys, Alf had
betrayed his brother on the occasion of the looting of the
walnut-tree.
</p>
<p>
Ern pointed out the spot to his bride and told the tale.
Ruth listened with grim understanding.
</p>
<p>
"That's Alf," she said.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Pigott lived there that time o day," Ern continued.
"One of the five Manors of Beachbourne, used to
be—I've heard dad say.  Belonged to the Salwyns of
Friston Place over the hill—the clergy-folk.  The farm's
where the Manor-house used to be; and the annual sheep-fair
was held in a field outside from William the Conqueror
till a few years back."
</p>
<p>
He pointed to one of a little row of villas on the left
which looked over the allotment gardens to the Downs.
</p>
<p>
"That's where Mr. Pigott lives now.  My school-master
he were that time o day."
</p>
<p>
"Who's Mr. Pigott?" Ruth asked.
</p>
<p>
Ernie rootled her with a friendly elbow.
</p>
<p>
"My guv'nor, stoopid!  Manager of the Southdown
Transport Company.  Him that was at the wedding—with
the beard.  Settin along o Mrs. Trupp."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Mr. <i>Pigott</i>!" answered Ruth.  Now that the
strain of the last two years was over at last, she brimmed
over with a demure naughtiness.  "Well, why couldn't you
say so, then?  You <i>are</i> funny, men are."
</p>
<p>
The cart climbed the steep hill to Billing's Corner and
Ernie looked down the familiar road to the Rectory and even
caught a peep of the back of his old home.  Then they
turned down Church Street with its old-world fragrance of
lavender and yesterday.
</p>
<p>
On the left the parish-church, long-backed and massive-towered
upon the Kneb, brooded over the centuries it had
seen come and go.
</p>
<p>
"Dad says the whole history of Beachbourne's centred
there," said Ernie in awed voice.  "Steeped in it, he says."
</p>
<p>
Ernie, who had been leaning forward to peep at the Archdeacon
posed in the entrance of St. Michael's, now dropped
back suddenly, nudging his companion.
</p>
<p>
A lean woman with white hair and wrathful black eyebrows,
her complexion still delicate as a girl's, was coming
up the hill.
</p>
<p>
"Mother," whispered Ernie.
</p>
<p>
It was Ruth's turn to raise the flap and peer forth
stealthily at the figure passing so close and so unconsciously
on the pavement.
</p>
<p>
So that was the woman who had opposed her marriage
with such malevolent persistency!
</p>
<p>
Ruth observed her enemy with more curiosity than
hostility, and received a passing impression of a fierce
unhappy face.
</p>
<p>
"She don't favour you no-ways," she said, as she
relapsed into a corner.  "Where's dad though?"
</p>
<p>
Ernie shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"He's never with her," he said.  "I ca-a-n't call to mind
as ever I've seen them out together, not the pair of them."
</p>
<p>
"I'd ha liked him to have been at the wedding," murmured
Ruth a thought discontentedly.
</p>
<p>
"And he'd ha liked it too, I'll lay," Ernie answered.
"Only she'd never have let him."
</p>
<p>
The cart stopped; and the two passengers descended
at the old <i>Star</i> opposite the Manor-house, which bore the
plate of Mr. William Trupp, the famous surgeon.
</p>
<p>
On the Manor-house steps a tall somewhat cadaverous
man was standing.  He was so simply dressed as almost
to be shabby; and his straw hat, tilted on the back of his
head, disclosed a singularly fine forehead.  There was
something arresting about the man and his attitude: a
delicious mixture of mischievous alertness and philosophical
detachment.  He might have been a mediæval scholar
waiting at the door of his master; or a penitent seeking
absolution; or, not least, a youth about to perpetrate a
run-away knock.
</p>
<p>
Ernie across the road watched him with eyes in which
affection and amusement mingled.  Then the door opened,
and the scholar-penitent-youth was being greeted with glee
by Bess Trupp.
</p>
<p>
Ernie turned to his wife.
</p>
<p>
"My old Colonel," he said confidentially.  "What I
was in India with.  Best Colonel the Hammer-men ever
had—and that's saying something."
</p>
<p>
"Colonel Lewknor, aren't it?" asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"That's him," said Ernie keenly.  "Do you knaw him?"
</p>
<p>
"He was over at Auston last summer," answered Ruth,
"lecturin we got to fight Germany or something.  I went,
but I didn't pay no heed to him.  No account talk, I
call that."
</p>
<p>
Together they dropped down Borough Lane and turned
to the left along the Moot where dwelt the workers of Old
Town—a few in flint cottages set in gardens, rank with
currant bushes, a record of the days, not so long ago, when
corn flowed down both sides of Water Lane, making a lake
of gold between the village on the hill and the Sea-houses by
the Wish; and most in the new streets of little red houses
that looked up, pathetically aware of their commonness, to
the calm dignity of the old church upon the Kneb above.
</p>
<p>
At one of these latter Ernie stopped and made believe
to fumble with a key.  Ruth, who had not seen her new
home, was thrilling quietly, as she had been throughout the
journey, though determined not to betray her emotion to
her mate.
</p>
<p>
The door opened and they entered.
</p>
<p>
A charming voice from the kitchen greeted them.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, there you are—punctual to the minute!"
</p>
<p>
A woman, silver-haired and gracious, turned from deft
busy-ness at the range.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Trupp!" cried Ruth, looking about her.
</p>
<p>
The table was laid already, and gay with flowers; the
fire lit, the kettle on the boil, the supper ready.
</p>
<p>
"It is kind," said Ruth.  "Was this you and Miss Bess?"
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps we had a hand in it," laughed the other.
"She couldn't be here, as she's got a meeting of her Boy
Scouts.  But she sent her best wishes.  Now I hand over the
key to the master; and my responsibilities are over!"  And
she was gone with the delicious ripple of laughter Ernie
had loved from babyhood.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was now thirsting to explore her new home,
but Ernie insisted on supping first.  This he did with
malicious deliberation.  When at length he was satisfied
they went upstairs together, he leading the way.
</p>
<p>
"This is our room!" he said with ill-disguised
complacency, stepping aside.
</p>
<p>
The bridal chamber was swept and garnished.  In it
were more flowers, bowls of them; and the furniture simple,
solid, and very good, was of a character rarely found in
houses of that class.
</p>
<p>
Ernie enjoyed the obvious pleasure of his bride as she
touched and glanced and dipped like some large bird flitting
gracefully from piece to piece.
</p>
<p>
Then she paused solemnly and looked about her.
</p>
<p>
"Reckon it must ha cost a tidy penny," she said.
</p>
<p>
"It did," Ernie answered.
</p>
<p>
She cocked a soft brown eye at him.
</p>
<p>
"Could you afford it, Ernie?"
</p>
<p>
"I could not," said Ernie, standing grimly and with
folded arms.
</p>
<p>
At the moment her eyes fell on a card tied to the
bed-post on which was written: <i>From Mr., Mrs. and Miss
Trupp</i>.  Ruth's eyes caressed the bed, and her fingers
stroked the smooth wood.
</p>
<p>
"It's like them," she said.  "None o your cheap trash."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," answered Ernie.  "Trust them.  They're just
all right, they are."
</p>
<p>
Before the looking-glass on the chest of drawers Ruth
now took off her hat.
</p>
<p>
She was perhaps too simple, too natural, too near to earth
to be shy at this the supreme moment of a woman's life.
At least she was too wary to show it.
</p>
<p>
"Rich folks they have two little beds laid alongside,
these days," she said, speaking from her experience as a maid.
"I wouldn't think it was right myself.  Only you mustn't
judge others."  She added in her slow way, as she patted
her hair—"I wouldn't feel prarperly married like only in
a prarper two-bed."
</p>
<p>
Ernie drew down the blind.
</p>
<p>
Then he marched upon his bride deliberately and with
remorseless eyes.  Suddenly she turned and met him with
a swift and lovely smile, dropping her mask, and discovering
herself to him in the surprising radiance of a moon that
reveals its beauty after long obscurity.  She laid her hands
upon his shoulders in utter surrender.  He gathered her
gradually in his arms; and closing his eyes, dwelt on her
lips with the slow and greedy passion of a bee, absorbed in
absorption, and drinking deep in the cloistered seclusion of
a fox-glove bell,
</p>
<p>
"You're prarperly married all right," he said.  "And
you ca-a-n't get out of it—not no-ways."

PART I
<br>
DEEPENING DUSK
</h2>
<p><br><br></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE HOSTEL
</h3>
<p>
Dr. Trupp of Beachbourne, as he was generally
known—Mr. Trupp, to give him his correct title—was a genuinely
great man.
</p>
<p>
His father had been a book-seller in Torquay; and he
himself never lost the greater qualities of the class from
which he sprang.  He was very simple and very shrewd.
Science had not blunted the fine intuitions which his brusque
manner half concealed.  Moreover, he trusted those
intuitions perhaps unconsciously as do few men of his
profession; and they rarely played him false.  In early
manhood his integrity, his sound common sense, and practical
idealism had won for him the love of a singularly noble girl
who might have married one of the best of her inevitably
artificial class.  Later in life indeed Evelyn Trupp often
would amuse her father and annoy her mother by affirming
that she was far prouder of being the wife of Mr. Trupp of
Beachbourne than of having been Miss Moray of Pole.  And
she had good cause.  For her husband was no longer the
country doctor at whom the county families had sniffed.
He was "Trupp of Beachbourne," whose fame had spread,
quietly it is true, from Sussex, through England to the outer
world.  And if there was some difference of opinion as to
whether Mr. Trupp had made Beachbourne, or Beachbourne
had made him, there was no question that the growth of the
town, and its deserved popularity as a health-resort was
coincident with his residence there.
</p>
<p>
At least the event justified the young surgeon's courage
and originality in the choice of a site for his life-long
campaign.  Indeed had he stayed in London it is certain that
he would never have achieved the work he was able to
consummate in the town girdled by the southern hills and
washed by Northern Seas.  And that work was no mean
contribution to the welfare of the race.  Mr. Trupp was a
pioneer in the organized attack on perhaps the deadliest
and most pertinacious enemy that threatens the supremacy
of Man—the tubercle bacillus.  And his choice of a
<i>point-d'appui</i> from which to conduct his offensive was no small
factor in his success.
</p>
<p>
He was, moreover, one of the men who in the last years
of the nineteenth century and the earlier years of this set
himself to stem the tide of luxury which in his judgment
was softening the spines of the younger generation.  And
the helpful buffets which gave him his name, and were
responsible at least for some of his triumphs, were not the
outcome of spasms of irritability but of a deliberate philosophy.
</p>
<p>
For Mr. Trupp, despite his kind heart, never forgot that
Man with all his aspirations after heaven had but yesterday
ceased to be an animal and still stood on the edge of the
slough from which he had just emerged, up to his hocks in
mud, the slime yet trickling from his shaggy sides.
</p>
<p>
"Don't give him sympathy," he would sometimes say
to an astonished father.  "What he wants is the Big
Stick ... Stop his allowance.  He'll soon get well.
Necessity's the best doctor....  Take her mother away
from her.  The mothers make half the invalids....
Let her get up early in the morning and take the kitchen-maid
tea in bed.  <i>She's</i> a useful citizen at all events."
</p>
<p>
He saw his country, so he believed, sinking into a dropsical
coma before his eyes, just for want of somebody to kick
it awake; and the sight made him sick and fearful.
</p>
<p>
Often riding with his daughter of evenings after the day's
work he would pause a moment beside the flag-staff on
Beau-nez and look North East across the waste of sea dull
or shining at his feet.
</p>
<p>
"Can you hear him growling, Bess?" he asked his
companion once.
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"The Brute."
</p>
<p>
Bess knew her father's ogre, and the common talk.
</p>
<p>
"Is Germany the Brute?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Her father shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"One of them," he answered.  "Wherever Man is there
the Brute is—keep that in mind when you're married, my
dear.  And he's always sleeping after a gorge or ravenous
before one.  Our Brute's asleep now he's got his belly full.
Theirs"—nodding across the water—"is prowling for
his prey."
</p>
<p>
To Mr. Pigott he confided his belief that there was only
one thing that could save England.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked the old school-master.
</p>
<p>
"A bloody war," replied Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
Many other men were saying the same thing, but few
of his intellectual calibre, and none of his radical views.
</p>
<p>
His own part in staying the rot that in his belief
threatened to corrupt the country he loved with such a deep
if critical love, was clear enough.  It was the business of him
and his colleagues to give the nation the health that made
for character, just as it was that of the school-master to
give them the character that made for health.  And he
tackled his side of national education with a will: the
Sun, the Sea, the Air being the assistants in whom he
trusted.
</p>
<p>
His old idea, cherished through a life-time, of an
open-air hostel, where he could have under his immediate
supervision children without their mothers, and wives without
their husbands, sought always more urgently for expression
as the years slipped by.  It was not, however, till the
twentieth century was well upon its way, that all the
conditions necessary for the safe launching of his project
were fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
His chance came when Colonel Lewknor and his wife
crossed his path on retirement from the Sendee.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Rachel Lewknor took up the old surgeon's plan with the
fierce yet wary courage of her race.
</p>
<p>
Here was her chance, heaven-sent.  Thus and thus
would she fulfil her cherished dream and make the money
to send her grandson, Toby, to Eton like his father and
grandfather before him.
</p>
<p>
Like most soldiers, she and the Colonel were poor.  All
through their working lives any money they might have
saved against old age they had invested in the education of
their boy; stinting themselves in order to send young Jock
to his father's school and afterwards to start him in his
father's regiment.  On retirement therefore they had
little but a pittance of a pension on which to live.  The
question of how to raise the capital to buy the site and
build the hostel was therefore the most urgent of the earlier
difficulties that beset Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp said frankly that he could lend the money
and would do so at a pinch; but he made it clear that he
would rather not.  He, too, was starting his boy Joe in the
Hammer-men, and like all civilians of those days had an
exaggerated idea of the expenses of an officer in the Army.
Moreover, he had determined that when the time and the
man came Bess should marry where she liked; and the
question of money should not stand in her way.
</p>
<p>
Happily Mrs. Lewknor's problem solved itself as by
miracle.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Alf Caspar, who had his garage in the Goffs at the
foot of Old Town and, in spite of the continued protests of
Mrs. Trupp and Bess, still drove for Mr. Trupp (the old
surgeon refusing steadfastly to keep a car of his own), had
from the start evinced an almost prurient interest in the
conception of the hostel.  In the very earliest days when
Mr. Trupp and Mrs. Lewknor talked it over as they drove
through Paradise, the beech-hangar between old Town and
Meads, to visit the prospective site in Cow Gap, he would
sit at his wheel manipulating his engine to ensure the
maximum of silent running, his head screwed round and big
left ear reaching back to lick up what was passing between
the two occupants of the body of the car.
</p>
<p>
Later, when it had actually been decided to embark
upon the scheme, he said to Mr. Trupp one day in his
brightest manner:
</p>
<p>
"Should be a paying proposition, sir, with you behind it."
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon eyed his chaffeur through his pince-nez
shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
"If you like to put £3,000 or so into it, Alfred, you
wouldn't do yourself any harm," he said.
</p>
<p>
Alf sheathed his eyes in that swift bird-like way of his,
and tittered.
</p>
<p>
"Three thousand pounds!" he said.  "Me!" ....
</p>
<p>
A few days later when Mr. Trupp called at the Colonel's
tiny villa in Meads.  Mrs. Lewknor ran out to him, eager as
a girl.
</p>
<p>
She had received from Messrs. Morgan and Evans,
the solicitors in Terminus Road, an offer of the sum required
on behalf of a client on the security of a first mortgage.
</p>
<p>
"It's a miracle!" she cried, her eyes sparkling like jewels.
</p>
<p>
"Or a ramp!" said the Colonel from behind.  "D'you
know anything about the firm, Trupp?"
</p>
<p>
"I've known and employed em ever since I've been
here," replied the old surgeon.  "They're as old as Beachbourne
and a bit older.  A Lewes firm really, and they still
have an office there.  But as the balance of power shifted
East they shifted with it."
</p>
<p>
"They don't say who their client is," commented the
Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"I'll ask em," the other answered.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon he drove down to Terminus Road,
and leaving Alf in the car outside, entered the office.
</p>
<p>
He and Mr. Morgan were old friends who might truly
be accounted among the founders of modern Beachbourne.
</p>
<p>
"Who's your client?" asked Mr. Trupp, gruff and
grinning.  "Out with it!"
</p>
<p>
Mr. Morgan shook his smooth grey head, humour and
mystery lurking about his mouth and in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Wishes to remain anonymous," he said.  "We're
empowered to act on his behalf."
</p>
<p>
He strolled to the window and peeped out, tilting on his
toes to overlook the screen which obscured the lower half of it.
</p>
<p>
What he saw seemed to amuse him, and his amusement
seemed to re-act in its turn on Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"Is he a solid man?" asked the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
"As a rock," came the voice from the window.
</p>
<p>
The other seemed satisfied; the contract forthwith was
signed; and Mrs. Lewknor bought her site.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Cow Gap was an ideal spot for the hostel.
</p>
<p>
It is carved out of the flank of Beau-nez; the gorse-covered
hill encircling it in huge green rampart that shelters
it from the prevailing Sou-West gales.  Embedded in the
majestic bluff that terminates the long line of the South
Downs and juts out into the sea in the semblance of a lion
asleep, head on his paws, it opens a broad green face to the
sea and rising sun.  The cliff here is very low, and the
chalk-strewn beach, easy of access from above, is seldom
outraged by skirmishers from the great army peopling the
sands along the front towards the Redoubt and the far
Crumbles.  A spur of the hill shuts it off from the
aristocratic quarter of the town, known as Meads, which
covers with gardened villas the East-ward foot-hills of
Beau-nez and ceases abruptly at the bottom of the Duke's
Drive that sweeps up the Head in graceful curves.
</p>
<p>
In this secluded coombe, that welcomes the sun at dawn,
at dusk holds the lingering shadows, and is flecked all day
with the wings of passing sea-birds, after many months of
delay and obstructions victoriously overcome, Mrs. Lewknor
began to build her house of bricks and mortar in the spring
of the year Ruth and Ernie Caspar set out together to
construct the future in a more enduring medium.
</p>
<p>
The house, long and low, with balconies broad as streets,
and windows everywhere to catch the light, rose layer by
layer out of the turf on the edge of the cliff.  All the
summer and on into the autumn it was a-building.  A
white house with a red roof, plain yet picturesque, it might
have been a coastguard station and was not.  Partaking
of the character of the cliffs on which it stood and the
green Downs in which it was enclosed, it seemed a fitting
tenant of the great coombe in which, apart from a pair of
goal-posts under the steep of the hill at the back, it was the
only evidence of the neighbourhood of Man.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp watched the gradual realisation of the dream
of a lifetime with the absorbed content of a child who
observes the erection of a house of wooden bricks.  And
he was not alone.
</p>
<p>
When at the end of the day's work Alf now drove his
employer, as he often did, to Cow Gap to study progress,
he, too, would descend and poke and pry amid skeleton walls
and crude dank passages with sharp eyes and sharper
whispered questions to labourers, foreman, and even the
architect.  Never a Sunday passed but found him bustling
across the golf-links before church, to ascend ladders, walk
along precarious scaffoldings, and march with proprietory
air and incredible swagger along the terraces of the newly
laid-out gardens that patched with brown the green quilt
of the coombe.
</p>
<p>
Once, on such a Sunday visit, he climbed the hill at the
back to obtain a bird's-eye view of the building.  Amid
spurting whin-chats and shining gossamers, he climbed in
the brilliant autumn morning till he had almost reached the
crest.  He was lost to the world and the beauty lavished
all about him; his eyes shuttered to the whispered
suggestions of the infinite; his heart closed to the revealing
loveliness of Earth, round-limbed and bare, as he revolved
in the dark prison-house of self the treadmill of his insect
projects.  The sidesman of St. Michael's, spruce, scented,
oiled, in fancy waistcoat, with boots of glace kid, and waxed
moustache, moving laboriously between sky and sea, was
civilised man at the height of his imperfection and
vain-glorious in his fatuous artificiality.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a bare head and collarless stark neck blurted
up out of a deep gorse-clump before him.
</p>
<p>
"Who goes there?" came a challenge, deep and formidable,
as the roar of some jungle lord disturbed in his
covert.
</p>
<p>
Alf collapsed as a soap-bubble, blown from a clay pipe
and brilliant in the sunshine, bursts at the impact of an
elemental prickle.  He fled down the hill incontinently.
</p>
<p>
The man who had barked, shoulder-deep in gorse, his
eyes still flashing, turned to the woman squandered beneath
him in luxurious splendour.  Native of the earth on which
she lay, and kin to it as some long-limbed hind of the forest,
she regarded him with amused content.  The sudden battle-call
of her male roused what there was of primitive in her,
soothed, and flattered her womanhood.  Comfortably she
fell back upon the sense of security it called up, delighting
behind half-drawn lids in the surprising ferocity of her
man.  That roar of his, startling the silence like a
trumpet-note, had spoken to her deeps.  Swiftly, and perhaps for
the first time, she recognised what the man above her
stood for in her life, and why one with whom she did not
pretend to be in love so completely satisfied her most
urgent present need.  He was a break-water behind which
she lay with furled sails after a hazardous voyage over
uncharted deeps.  Outside was still the roar and batter of
seas.  The sound of guns booming overhead as she lay,
stripped of her canvas, and rocking pleasantly in the inner
waters, did not alarm, rather indeed lulled, her to sleep:
for they spoke to her of protection at last.
</p>
<p>
"Who was it, Ernie?" she murmured, raising a lazy
head from the hands on which they were pillowed, the
dark hair strewn about her like wind-slashed rain.
</p>
<p>
The man turned, outraged still and bristling.
</p>
<p>
"Alf!" he snorted.  "Just bob me head over the
hawth at him.  That was enough—<i>quite</i> enough!  I
knaw the colour of Alf's liver."
</p>
<p>
He stood above her with his air of a fighting male.
</p>
<p>
She had never seen him like that before; and she
regarded him critically and with approval.
</p>
<p>
"Ern," she called quietly, with a chuckle, deep and
secret as the gurgle of water pouring from a long-throated
jug; and with a faint movement of her hips she made room
for him in the sand beside her.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
COW GAP
</h3>
<p>
Honeymoons are not for the class that does the world's
dirty work; but joy can be seized by the simple of heart
even in the conditions we impose upon the poor.
</p>
<p>
Ernie Caspar after his marriage with Ruth Boam settled
down with his bride in Old Town to enjoy the fruits of
victory.
</p>
<p>
The young couple had been lucky to find a cottage in
the Moot; for even in those days accommodation for the
working-class was as hard to find in Beachbourne as elsewhere.
The cottage, too, was appropriately situated for them
in every way.  It was close to the yard of the Southdown
Transport Company, where Ernie's work lay; and at the
bottom of Borough Lane, at the top of which was the
Manor-house, where lived Mr. and Mrs. Trupp, who had seen Ruth
through her trouble, and had befriended Ernie from his
boyhood.
</p>
<p>
"D'you remember that first time ever we rode up to
Old Town together tarp o the bus?" asked Ernie of his
bride, one evening as they passed the great doctor's house
on the way to Beau-nez.
</p>
<p>
"Hap I do," Ruth answered, amused at her lover's
intense seriousness.
</p>
<p>
"And do <i>you</i> remember what I said to you?" insistently.
</p>
<p>
"Ne'er a word," answered Ruth, casual and teasing—"only
it was no-account talk.  That's all I remember."
</p>
<p>
"I pointed you out Mr. Trupp's house," Ernie continued
solemnly, "and I says to you—<i>He brought me into the world</i>,
I says.  <i>That's what he done</i>."
</p>
<p>
The old roguish black-bird look, which after her winter
of despair had been creeping slowly back to Ruth's face
in this new spring, gleamed sedately now.
</p>
<p>
"I mind me now," she said.  "Leastwise I don't remember
what you said, but I remembers what I answered."
</p>
<p>
"What did you answer then?" asked Ernie, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
"<i>He done well</i>, was what I says," answered the young
woman gravely.
</p>
<p>
"He did," replied Ernie with exaggerated pomp.
"And he done better to settle issalf at my door so I could
be his friend if so be he ever gotten into trouble."
</p>
<p>
"One thing I knaw," said Ruth, serious in her turn
now.  "They're the two best friends e'er a workin woman
had."
</p>
<p>
"They are," Ernie agreed.  "And she's my god-mother."
</p>
<p>
It was the fact in his life of which on the whole he was
most proud and certainly the one for which he was least
responsible.  "And she aren't yours," he continued,
puffed up and self-complacent.  "And never will be."  He
added finally to curb her arrogance.  "See she was dad's
friend afore ever they married, eether of them."
</p>
<p>
Ruth checked her husband's snobbishness with a tap.
</p>
<p>
"You <i>are</i> grand," she said.
</p>
<p>
Close to the cottage of the young couple was the lovely
old Motcombe garden, public now, pierced by the bourne
from which the town derives its name.  The garden with
its ancient dove-cot, ivy-crowned, its splendid weeping
ashes, its ruined walls, compact of native flint and chalk,
the skeletons of afore-time barns and byres, stands between
the old parsonage house and older parish-church that crowns
the Kneb above and, with its massive tower, its squat
shingled spire peculiar to Sussex, set four-square to the
winds of time, seems lost in a mist of memories.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the church, a few hundred yards further up the
hill, at the back of Billing's Corner in Rectory Walk,
Ernie's parents still dwelt.
</p>
<p>
Anne Caspar did not visit Ruth.  Indeed, she ignored
the presence of her daughter-in-law; but those steel-blue
eyes of hers sought out and recognized in a hard flash the
majestic peasant girl who now haunted Church Street at
shopping hours as the woman who had married her son.
Ernie's mother was in fact one of those who make it a point
of duty, as well as a pleasure, never to forgive.  She had
neither pardoned Ruth for daring to be her daughter-in-law,
nor forgotten her sin.  And both offences were
immeasurably accentuated by Ruth's crime in establishing
herself in the Moot.
</p>
<p>
"Settlin on my door-step," she said.  "Brassy slut!"
</p>
<p>
"Just like her," her second son answered; and added
with stealthy malice, "Dad visits em.  I seen im."
</p>
<p>
Alf, for all his acuteness, had never learned the simple
lesson that his mother would not tolerate the slightest
criticism of her old man.
</p>
<p>
"And why shouldn't he?" she asked sharply.  "Isn't
Ern his own flesh-and-blood?  <i>He's</i> got a heart, dad has,
if some as ought to ave aven't."
</p>
<p>
"No reason at all," answered Alf, looking down his
nose.  "Why shouldn't he be thick in with her—and
with her child for the matter of that?  I see him walkin in
the Moot the other day near the Quaker meeting-house
hand-in-hand with little Alice.  Pretty as a Bible picture
it struck me."
</p>
<p>
Anne Caspar stared stonily.
</p>
<p>
"Who's little Alice?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Her love-child," answered Alf.  "Like your
grand-child as you might say—only illegit o course."
</p>
<p>
His mother breathed heavily.
</p>
<p>
"Is Ern the father?" she asked at last in a sour flat
voice.
</p>
<p>
"Not him!" jeered Alf.  "She's a rich man's cast-off,
Ruth is.  Made it worth Ern's while.  That's where it
was.  See, cash is cash in this world."
</p>
<p>
Anne laid back her ears as she rummaged among her
memories,
</p>
<p>
"I thought you told me," she began slowly, "as Ern—"
</p>
<p>
"Never!" cried Alf.  "Ern had nothin to do with it,
who-ever had."
</p>
<p>
"Who was the father?" asked Anne, not above a little
feminine curiosity.
</p>
<p>
Alf shook his head cunningly.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," he said, "now you're askin!" and added after a
moment's pause:—
</p>
<p>
"She was all-the-world's wench one time o day, your
daughter was.  That's all I can tell you."
</p>
<p>
Anne stirred a saucepan thoughtfully.  She did not
believe Alf: for she knew that Ernie was far too much his
father's son to be bought disgracefully, and she remembered
suddenly a suggestion that Mr. Pigott had lately thrown out
to the effect that Alf himself had not been altogether proof
against the seductions of this seductive young woman his
brother had won.  It struck her now that there might be
something in the story after all, unlikely as it seemed:
for she remarked that Alf always pursued his sister-in-law
with the covert rancour and vindictiveness of the mean
spirit which has met defeat.
</p>
<p>
But however doubtful she might be in her own heart of
Alf's tale, the essential facts about Ruth were not in dispute:
her daughter-in-law was the mother of an illegitimate
child and had settled down with that child not a quarter of a
mile away.  Everybody knew the story, especially of course
the neighbours she would least wish to know it—the
Archdeacon and Lady Augusta in the Rectory across the way.
For over thirty years Anne had lived in her solid little
blue-slated house, the ampelopsis running over its good red
face, the tobacco plants sweet on summer evenings in the
border round the neat and tidy lawn, holding her nose high,
too high her enemies averred, and priding herself above all
women on her respectability—and now!
</p>
<p>
No wonder Ernie, bringing home his bride and his
disgrace, infuriated her.
</p>
<p>
"Shamin me afore em all!" she muttered time and
again with sullen wrath to the pots and pans she banged
about on the range.
</p>
<p>
She never saw the offender now except on Sundays when
he came up to visit his father, which he did as regularly as
in the days before his marriage.  The ritual of these visits
was always the same.  Ernie would come in at the front-door;
she would give him a surly nod from the kitchen;
he would say quietly—"Hullo, mum!" and turn off into
the study where his dad was awaiting him.
</p>
<p>
The two, Anne remarked with acrimony, grew always
nearer and—what annoyed her most—talked always less.
Edward Caspar was an old man now, in body if not in years;
and on the occasion of Ernie's visits father and son rarely
strolled out to take the sun on the hill at the back or
lounge in the elusive shade of Paradise as in former
days.  They were content instead to sit together in the
austere little study looking out on to the trees of the
Rectory, Lely's famous <i>Cavalier</i>, the first Lord Ravensrood,
glancing down from the otherwise bare walls with
wistful yet ironic eyes on his two remote descendants
enjoying each other beneath in a suspicious communion
of silence.
</p>
<p>
Thus Anne always found the pair when she brought them
their tea; and the mysterious intimacy between the two
was all the more marked because of her husband's almost
comical unawareness of his second son.  The genuine
resentment Anne experienced in the matter of Edward's
unvarying attitude towards his two sons she visited,
regardless of justice, upon Alf.
</p>
<p>
"Might not be a son to your father the way you go on!"
she said censoriously.
</p>
<p>
"And what about him," cried Alf, not without reason.
"Might not be a father to your son, seems to me."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
It would, however, have taken more than Anne Caspar's
passionate indignation at the action of Ernie and his bride
in establishing themselves in the Moot to cloud the lives of
the newly-married couple.  Ern was now twenty-eight,
and Ruth four years younger.  They had the present, which
they enjoyed; they did not worry about the future; and
the past inevitably buries itself in time.
</p>
<p>
"We're young yet, as Mr. Trupp says," remarked Ernie.
"We've got it all afore us.  Life's not so bad for all they say.
I got you: and you got me; and the rest don't matter."
</p>
<p>
They were lying on Beau-nez in the dusk above Cow Gap,
listening to the long-drawn swish of the sea, going and
coming with the tranquil rhythm that soothes the spirit of
man, restless in Time, with rumours of forgotten Eternity.
</p>
<p>
"And we both got little Alice," murmured Ruth, eyes
resting on his with affectionate confidence, sure of his love
for her and the child that was not his.
</p>
<p>
"Keep me cosy, Ern," whispered the luxurious
creature with a delicious mixture of entreaty and authority
snuggling up against him.  She was lying, her face lifted
flower-wise to the moon that hung above her bubble-like
and benignant, her eyes closed, her lips tilted to tempt
the pollen-bearing bee, while about them the lovely laughter
brimmed and dimpled.
</p>
<p>
"I'll keep you cosy, my beauty," replied Ernie, with
the busy seriousness of the male intent on love.  "I'll
give you plenty beside little Alice to think of afore I'm done
with you.  I'll learn <i>you</i>.  Don't you worrit.  I know
what <i>you</i> want."
</p>
<p>
"What then?" asked Ruth, deep and satisfied.
</p>
<p>
"Why, basketfuls o babies—armfuls of em, like cowslips
till you're fairly smothered, and spill em over the field
because you can't hold em all."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps he was right.  Certainly after the battle and
conflict of the last two years Ruth felt spiritually lazy.
She browsed and drowsed, content that Ernie for the time
being should master her.  It was good for him, too, she
saw, so long as he would do it, correcting his natural
tendency to slackness; and she had little doubt that she could
assume authority at will in the future, should it prove
necessary.  Meanwhile that spirit of adventure which
lurked in her; distinguished her from her class; and had
already once led her into danger and catastrophe, was lulled
to sleep for the moment.
</p>
<p>
The hill at the back of Cow Gap is steep, and towards the
crest the gorse grows thick and very high.  In the heart of
this covert, dense enough to satisfy the most jealous lovers,
Ernie had made a safe retreat.  He had cut away the
resisting gorse with a bill-hook, rooted up the stumps, stripped
the turf and made a sleeping-place of sand brought up from
the shore.  In a rabbit-hole hard by, he hid a spirit-lamp
and sundry stores of tea and biscuits; while Mrs. Trupp
routed out from her coach-house an immense old carriage
umbrella dating from Pole days which, when unfurled,
served to turn a shower.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Ernie called their hiding-place the Ambush;
for in it they could harbour, seeing all things, yet
themselves unseen.  And there, through that brilliant autumn,
they would pass their week-ends, watching Under-cliff, as
the hostel was called, rising up out of the saucer of the
coombe beneath them.  They would leave little Alice with
a neighbour, and lock up the cottage in the Moot, which
Ruth was swiftly transfiguring into a home.  On Saturday
evenings, after a hard afternoon's work, stripping, papering,
painting, making the old new and the dull bright, the pair
would walk up Church Street, turn to the left at Billing's
Corner, and dropping down Love Lane by the Rectory,
cross the golf links and mount the hill by the rabbit-walk
that leads above Paradise, past the dew-pond, on to the
broad-strewn back of Beau-nez.  Up there, surrounded by
the dimming waters and billowing land, they would wait
till the Head was deserted by all save a tethered goat and
watchful coastguard; till in the solitude and silence the stars
whispered, and the darkening turf, grateful for the falling
dew, responded sweetly to their pressing feet.  Then the
young couple, taking hands, would leave the crest and find
their way with beating hearts along the track that led
through the covert to their couching-place, where none
would disturb them except maybe a hunting stoat; and
only the moon would peep at them under the shaggy
eyebrow of the gorse as they rejoiced in their youth, their
love, their life.
</p>
<p>
And then at dawn when the sun glanced warily over
the brim of the sea and none was yet astir save the kestrel
hovering in the wind; and the pair of badgers—who with
the amazing tenacity of their kind still tenanted the burrows
of their ancestors within a quarter of a mile of the tents
and tabernacles of man—rooted and sported clumsily on the
dewy hillside beneath; they would rise and slip bare-foot
down the hill, past the hostel, on to the deserted beach, there
to become one with the living waters, misty and lapping, as
at night they had entered into communion with earth and
sky and the little creaking creatures of the dark.
</p>
<p>
"This is life," Ernie said on one such Sabbath dawn,
sinking into the waters with deep content.  "Wouldn't
old dad just love this?"
</p>
<p>
"If it were like this all the time!" Ruth answered a
thought wistfully as she floated with paddling hands, sea
and sky, as it was in the beginning, enveloping her.  "Like
music in church.  Just the peace that passeth
understanding, as my Miss Caryll'd say."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Ernie, speaking with the profound sagacity
that not seldom marks the words of the foolish.  "Might
be bad for us.  If there was nothing to fight we'd all be like
to go to sleep.  That's what Mr. Trupp says."
</p>
<p>
"Some of us might," said Ruth, the girl slyly peeping
forth from her covering womanhood.
</p>
<p>
"Look at Germany!" continued the wise man, surging
closer.  "Look at what the Colonel said the other night at
the Institute.  We're the rabbits; and Germany's the
python, the Colonel says."
</p>
<p>
"That for Germany!" answered Ruth, splashing the
water with the flat of her hand in the direction of the rising
sun.
</p>
<p>
"And she's all the while a-creepin—a-creepin—closer
acrarst the sea," said Ernie, edging nearer—"for to
SWALLOW US UP!"  And with a rush he engulfed her young
body in his arms.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE WATCHMAN ON THE HEAD
</h3>
<p>
On one of the last days of that brilliant October, just
before the grey curtain of rains descended to blot out
autumn fields and twinkling waters, Colonel Lewknor and
his wife moved into the hostel.
</p>
<p>
On that first evening Mrs. Lewknor came down the
broad stair-case in "review order," as she called it, to
celebrate the consummation of the first stage of her
project, and found her husband standing at the sea-ward
window of the hall, a Mestophelian figure, holding back
the curtain and peeping out.  Quietly she came and stood
beside him, about her shoulders the scarlet cape a Rajput
Princess had given her after Lord Curzon's durbar.
</p>
<p>
The house, which was the solitary building in the great
coombe, stood back some hundred yards from the cliff along
which the coast-guard's path to Beau-nez showed up
white-dotted in the darkness.  The Colonel was staring out over
the misty and muffled waters, mumbling to himself, as was
his way.
</p>
<p>
"We shall get a nice view from here, anyway," he said
with his satyr-like chuckle.
</p>
<p>
She laid her hand upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"Of what?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"The landing," he replied.
</p>
<p>
She rippled off into a delicious titter.  After thirty years
of married life her Jocko was still for Rachel Lewknor the
most entertaining of men.
</p>
<p>
"You and Mr. Trupp!" she said.  "A pair of you!"  For
the two men had drawn singularly close since the Colonel
on retirement had established himself in Meads.
</p>
<p>
The old soldier in truth came as something of a revelation
to the great surgeon, who delighted in the other's
philosophical mind, his freedom from the conventional
limitations and prejudices of the officer-caste, his wide
reading and ironical humour.
</p>
<p>
On his evening ride one day about this time Mr. Trupp
and Bess came upon the Colonel halted at the flag-staff
on the top of the Head, and gazing out over the wide-spread
waters with solemn eyes, as though watching for a
tidal wave to sweep up out of the East and overwhelm his
country.  Mr. Trupp knew that the old soldier was often
at that spot in that attitude at that hour, a sentinel on guard
at the uttermost end of the uttermost peninsula that
jutted out into the Channel; and he knew why.
</p>
<p>
"Well, is it coming?" the doctor growled, half serious,
half chaffing.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, standing with his hat off, his fine forehead
and cadaverous face thrusting up into the blue, answered
with quiet conviction.
</p>
<p>
"It's coming all right."
</p>
<p>
"It's been coming all my time," answered the other
sardonically.  "If it don't come soon I shall miss it.  In
the seventies it was Russia.  Any fool, who wasn't a criminal
or a traitor or both, could see that a clash was inevitable.
Two great races expanding at incredible speed in Asia,
etc., etc.  Then in the nineties it was France.  Any man
in his right mind could see it.  It was mathematically
demonstrable.  Two great races expanding in Africa, etc.,
etc....  And now it's Germany..."  He
coughed and ended gruffly, "Well, you may be right this
time."
</p>
<p>
"We were right about William the Conqueror," said the
Colonel urbanely.  "He came."
</p>
<p>
"But that was some time ago, my daughter tells me,"
replied Mr. Trupp.  "And you've been wrong every time
since."
</p>
<p>
Bess giggled; and the Colonel adjusted his field-glasses
with delicate precision.
</p>
<p>
"If you say it's going to rain and keep on saying it
long enough you'll probably prove right in the end," he
remarked.  "It's dogged as does it in the realm of
speculation as elsewhere in my experience."
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon and his daughter turned their backs
on the flagstaff and the solitary watchman beside it, and
jogged towards the sunset red-strewn behind the white
bluff of the Seven Sisters Newhaven-way.
</p>
<p>
Two figures topped the brow of Warren Hill in front
and came swiftly over the short turf towards them.  It was
Saturday: Ruth and Ernie were on their way to their secret
covert above Cow Gap as usual.
</p>
<p>
"About your last week-end up here before the weather
breaks, I should say," chaffed the old surgeon as he passed
them.
</p>
<p>
Ernie laughed a little nervously.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir.  Just what I were a-sayin to Ruth," he
answered.  He had thought his secret known to none.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I hope the police won't catch you," remarked the
other with a grin as he rode on.
</p>
<p>
"Never!—not unless someone was to give us away,
sir!" said Ruth demurely, as she looked across the sea under
lowered brows.
</p>
<p>
Bess called back reassuringly over her shoulder:
</p>
<p>
"You're all right, Ruth.  I'll square Mr. Trupp."
</p>
<p>
The riders struck Duke's Drive and dropped down into
Meads.
</p>
<p>
"How happy Ernie looks now!" said Bess.  "It's
delightful to see him."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied her father—"too happy.  He's going
to sleep again—just what I told you.  And when he's well
away in the land of dreams <i>IT</i>'ll pounce on him once more."
</p>
<p>
That evening over his coffee Mr. Trupp returned to the
subject, which was a favourite with him.
</p>
<p>
"I always knew how it would be," he said with gloomy
complacency.
</p>
<p>
"Of course," answered Mrs. Trupp, glancing
mischievously at Bess.
</p>
<p>
"Makes him too comfortable," the wise man continued.
"Fatal mistake.  What he wants is an occasional flick with
the whip to keep him up to the mark.  We all do."
</p>
<p>
It was not, indeed, in Ruth's nature to use the whip or
inspire the fear which few of us as yet are able to do
without.  And at present she did not bother much.  For at
first her beauty and spiritual power were quite enough to
hold Ernie.  He found in her the comfort and the stay
the tree finds in the earth it is rooted in.  She was the
element in which he lived and moved and had his being.
She satisfied his body and his spirit as the sea satisfies the
fish which dwells in it.  She steadied him and that was
what he needed.
</p>
<p>
The marriage, indeed, proved as successful as are
most.  That is to say it was not a failure, in that
both the contracting parties were on the whole the
happier for it.  Certainly Ern was: for there was no
doubt that he was in love with Ruth, nor that his love was
real and enduring.
</p>
<p>
Ruth on her side was fond of Ern, and grateful to him,
if only because of little Alice; although her feeling was
more that of the mother for the child than of the woman for
her mate.  She was full of pity for him and occasionally
unuttered resentment.  That was inevitable because Ern
was weak.  She had continually to prop him up, though
she would rather have let him do the propping.  And
perhaps for her own growth it was good that she must give
support rather than receive it.
</p>
<p>
In a way she was not the ideal wife for Ern: her strength
was her weakness.  She appeared almost too big of soul
and tranquil of spirit.  But there was another side of her,
largely undeveloped, that had as yet only revealed itself in
gleams, or rather, to be exact, in one lurid flash of lightning
which had thrown her firmament into ghastly and twittering
relief.  Her quiet was the hushed and crouching quiet
of the young lilac in winter, lying secretly in wait for the
touch of April sun, to leap forth from its covert in an
amazing ecstasy of colour, fragrance, loveliness and power.
</p>
<p>
For the time being Ruth was glad to lie up, as a tigress
in whelp, after long hunting, is content to harbour in the
green darkness, drinking in draughts of refreshing through
sleep, while her mate prowls out at dusk to find meat.  But
that would not last for ever.  Her life must be full and
brimming over or her insatiable vitality and that all-devouring
spirit of hers, reaching out like a creeper to embrace the
world, might find outlet in mischief, innocent enough in the
intention, and yet, as experience had already proved,
catastrophic in its consequences.
</p>
<p>
In her secret deeps, indeed, Ruth was one to whom
danger was the breath of life, although she was still
unaware of it: an explorer and pioneer, gay and gallant,
sailing her skiff over virgin oceans, reckless of the sunken
reefs that might at any moment rip the bottom out of her
frail craft.  The outward sedateness of the Sussex peasant
was liable at any moment to sudden overthrow, as some
chance spark caused the southern blood in her veins to leap
and frolic into flame; and that Castilian hidalgo, her remote
ancestor, who lurked behind the arras of the centuries,
called her away from the timid herd to some dear and
desperate enterprise of romance.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp alone was aware of this buccaneer quality
hidden in the young woman's heart and undiscovered of the
world.  Ruth's Miss Caryll had told her friend of it long
ago when the girl was in her service at the Dower-house,
Aldwoldston.
</p>
<p>
"It's the Spaniard in her," Miss Caryll had said.
</p>
<p>
And when at the time of her distress Ruth had told her
story to the wife of the great surgeon who had succoured
her, Mrs. Trupp, keen-eyed for all her gentleness, had
more than once detected the flash of a sword in the murk
of the tragedy.
</p>
<p>
The girl had dared—and been defeated.  She would
dare again—until she found her conqueror: thus Mrs. Trupp
envisaged the position.
</p>
<p>
Was Ernie that man?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
ALF
</h3>
<p>
Then a child lifted its tiny sail on the far horizon.  Its
rippling approach across the flood-tides absorbed Ruth and
helped Ernie: for he had in him much of his father's
mysticism, and was one of those men who go through life
rubbing their eyes as the angels start up from the dusty
road, and they see miracles on every side where others only
find the prosaic permutations and combinations of mud.
And this particular miracle, taking place so deliberately
beneath his roof, a miracle of which he was the unconscious
agent, inspired and awed him.
</p>
<p>
"Makes you sweat to think of it," he said to a mate in
the yard.
</p>
<p>
"By then you've had half-a-dozen and got to keep em,
you'll sweat less," retorted his friend, who had been married
several years.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp looked after Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Great man as he was now, he still attended faithfully
those humble families who had supported him when first
he had established himself in Old Town thirty years before,
young, unknown, his presence fiercely resented by the older
practitioners.
</p>
<p>
When Ruth's time came, Ernie sat in the kitchen,
shaken to the soul, and listening to the feet in the room
above.
</p>
<p>
It was a dirty night, howling, dark and slashed with rain.
Outside in the little dim street that ran below the Kneb
on which loomed the shadowy bulk of the parish-church,
solid against the cloud-drift, stood the doctor's car.
</p>
<p>
Once Ernie went to the rain-sluiced window and saw Alf
with his collar turned up crouching behind the wheel.
</p>
<p>
Ernie went out into the flapping night.
</p>
<p>
"Ere, Alf!" he said hoarsely.  "We can't go on like
this.  Tain't in nature.  After all, we're brothers."
</p>
<p>
The two had not spoken since the one had possessed
the woman the other had desired.
</p>
<p>
Alf now showed himself curiously complacent.
</p>
<p>
"I am a Christian all right," he confided to his brother;
and added with the naïve self-satisfaction of the
megalomaniac, as he shook hands: "I wish there was more like
me, I do reelly."
</p>
<p>
"Come in, then," said Ern, who was not listening.  "I
can't abear to see you out here such a night as this and all."
</p>
<p>
Alf came in.
</p>
<p>
The two brothers sat over the fire in the kitchen, Alf
uplifted, his gaitered legs crossed.  He looked about him
brightly with that curious proprietory air of his.
</p>
<p>
"You've a decent little crib here, Ern, I see," he said.
</p>
<p>
"None so bad," Ernie answered briefly.
</p>
<p>
"Done it up nice too," the other continued.  "Did
your landlord do that now?"
</p>
<p>
"No; me and Ruth atween us."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, he'll raise your rent against you."
</p>
<p>
"Like em," said Ern.  "They're all the same."
</p>
<p>
Somebody moved overhead.
</p>
<p>
Ern, stirred to his deeps, rose and stood, leaning his
forehead on the mantel-piece, his ears aloft.
</p>
<p>
"This is a bad job, Ern," said Alf—"a shockin bad job."
</p>
<p>
"It's killin me," Ern answered with the delicious
egoism of the male at such moments.
</p>
<p>
There was a lengthy silence.  Then Alf spoke
again—casually this time.
</p>
<p>
"She never said nothin to you about no letter, did she?"
</p>
<p>
"It's burned," replied Ernie curtly.
</p>
<p>
Alf glanced at his brother sharply.  Then, satisfied that
the other was in fact telling the truth, he resumed his study of
the fire.
</p>
<p>
"Not as there was anythink in it there shouldn't have
been," he said complacently.  "You can ask anyone."  He
was silent for a time.  Then he continued confidentially,
leaning forward a little—"When you see her tell her I'm
safe.  May be that'll ease her a bit."
</p>
<p>
Ernie came to himself and glowered.
</p>
<p>
"What ye mean?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Alf cocked his chin, knowing and mysteriously.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," he said.  "You just tell her what I tell you—<i>Alf
won't let on; Alf's safe</i>.  Just that.  You'll see."
</p>
<p>
There was a stir and a movement in the room above:
then the howl of a woman in travail.
</p>
<p>
Ern was panting.  Silence succeeded the storm.  Then
a tiny miaowing from the room above came down to them.
</p>
<p>
Alf started to his feet.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" he cried.
</p>
<p>
"My child," answered Ernie deeply, lifting a blind face
to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
Alf was afraid of many things; but most of all he
feared children, and was brutal to them consequently, less
from cruelty, as the unimaginative conceived, than in
self-defence.  And the younger the child the more he feared
it.  The presence in the house of this tiny creature, emerging
suddenly into the world from the darkness of the Beyond
with its mute and mysterious message, terrified him.
</p>
<p>
"Here!  I'm off!" he said.  "This ain't the place for
me," and he left the house precipitately.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp of course went to visit the young mother.
Ruth in bed, nursing her babe, met her with a smile that was
radiant yet wistful.
</p>
<p>
"It's that different to last time," she said, and nodded
at little Alice playing with her beads at the foot of the bed.
"See, she'd no one—only her mother ... and you
... and Mr. Trupp.  They were all against her—poor
lamb!—as if it was fault of her'n."  She gasped, choking
back a sob.—"This'n's got em all on her side."
</p>
<p>
"That's all over now, Ruth," said Mrs. Trupp gently.
</p>
<p>
"I pray so, with all my heart I do," answered Ruth.
"You never knaw.  Seems to me some things are never
over—not in this world anyways."
</p>
<p>
She blinked back tears, drew her hand across her eyes,
and flashed up bravely.
</p>
<p>
"Silly, ain't it?" she laughed.  "Only times it all come
back so—what we went through, she and me.  And not
through any fault of mine—only foolishness like."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Ruth was one of those women who are a standing vindication
of our civilisation and a challenge to all who indict
it.  She was up and about in an incredibly short time, the
firmer in body and soul for her adventure.
</p>
<p>
One morning Alf came round quietly to see her.  She
was at the wash-tub, busy and bare-armed; and met him
with eyes that were neither fearful nor defiant.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not a-goin to hurt you, Ruth," he began caressingly,
with a characteristic lift of his chin.  "I only come
to say it's all right.  You got nothink against me now and
I'll forget all I know about you.  A bargain's a bargain.
And now you've done your bit I'll do mine."
</p>
<p>
The announcement, so generous in its intention, did not
seem to make the expected impression.
</p>
<p>
"I am a gentleman," continued Alf, leaning against the
door-post.  "Always ave been.  It's in me blood, see?
Can't help meself like even if I was to wish to."  He started
off on a favourite theme of his.  "Lord Ravensrood—him
that made that speech on the Territorials the other night
in the House of Lords, he's my second cousin.  I daresay
if enough was to die I'd be Lord Ravensrood meself.  Often
whiles I remember that.  I'm not like the rest of them.  I
got blue blood running through me veins, as Reverend
Spink says.  You can tell that by the look of me.  I'm not
the one to take advantage."
</p>
<p>
Ruth, up to her elbows in soap-suds, lifted her face.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not afraid o you, Alf," she said quite simply.
"Now I got my Ern."
</p>
<p>
The announcement annoyed Alf.  He rolled his head
resentfully.
</p>
<p>
"No one as does right has anythink to fear from me,"
he said harshly.  "It's only wrong-doers I'm a terror to.
Don't you believe what they tell you.  So long as you keep
yourself accordin and don't interfere with nobody, nobody
won't interfere with you, my gurl."
</p>
<p>
Ruth mocked him daintily.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not your girl," she said, soaping her beautifully
moulded arms.  "I'm Ern's girl, and proud of it."  Her
lovely eyes engaged his, teasing and tempting.  "That's
our room above—his and mine.  It's cosy."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Alf, smouldering.  "I'd like to see it."
</p>
<p>
"You can't do that," answered Ruth gravely.
"Besides, there's nothing to see only the double-bed
Mrs. Trupp gave us and the curtains to close it at night and
that, so that no one shan't peep at what they should'nt."
</p>
<p>
The touch of southern blood, wild and adventurous,
which revealed itself in her swarthy colouring and black
hair, stung her on to darings demure as they were
provocative.  Alf, sour of eye, changed the subject.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, it's a nice little bit of a crib," he said, glancing
round.  "What might be your rent?"
</p>
<p>
"More'n it ought to be," answered Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"That's a pity," said Alf.  "What's Ern's money now?"
</p>
<p>
"I shan't tell you."
</p>
<p>
Alf thrust his huge head forward with an evil grin.
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you," he said.  "It's twenty-four, and that's
the limit.  Pigott won't raise him no more.  I know
Pigott."  He gloated over his victim.  "Yes, old Ern
makes in the week what I'd make in a day if I was to do
nothink only loll against the wall with me mouth open to
catch the interest on me money that'd roll into it.  And
I'm makin all the time: for God's give me brains and I'm
usin em.  I'm not a-going to drive for somebody else all
my life.  I'm the comin man in this town—you ask my
bankers.  There's plenty doin <i>you</i> don't know nothin of,
and more to come.  And I'm at the back of it!—I'm the
man what makes things move—that's what I am!"  He
swelled like a little bull-frog.  "I'm a gentleman—that's
Alf."  He shot his face forward and wagged a finger at her.
"And that's just the difference between Ern and me.  I'm
in the position to live on me own money and never do a
hand's turn for it: while Ern has to sweat for his handful
of coppers.  And <i>then</i> it ain't enough to keep his wife from
the wash-tub.  I'd like to see <i>my</i> wife at that!—Now
then!"  He folded his arms and struck an attitude.
</p>
<p>
Ruth soused and wrung and rinsed quite unmoved.
</p>
<p>
"That aren't the only difference, Alf," she said soothingly.
"See, Ern's got me.  That makes up to him a lot,
he says.  He says he don't care nothing so long as he's
got me to issalf, he says....  Strawberries and cream and
plenty of em, he calls me when he's got the curtains draw'd
up there, and me a-settin on his knee."
</p>
<p>
Alf retreated, burning and baffled.  She came to the
door drying her arms, and pursued her victim with eyes in
which the lightning played with laughter; as fastidious
and dainty in her cruelty as a cat sporting with a mouse.
</p>
<p>
A little way down the street he paused and turned.
Then he came back a pace or two stealthily.  His face
was mottled and he was tilting his chin, mysterious and
confidential.
</p>
<p>
"Never hear e'er a word from the Captain?" he asked,
in a hushed voice.
</p>
<p>
Ruth flashed a terrible white and her bosom surged.
</p>
<p>
"I do times," continued the tormentor, and bustled on
his way with a malignant chuckle.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE CREEPING DEATH
</h3>
<p>
One evening at the club, Mr. Trupp asked the Colonel what
had happened to Captain Royal.
</p>
<p>
"He went through the Staff College, and now he's at
the War Office, I believe," the other answered curtly.
</p>
<p>
"Ever hear from him?" asked Mr. Trupp, warily.
</p>
<p>
"No," said the Colonel.  "He's not a friend of mine."  And
to save himself and an old brother-officer for whom he
had neither liking nor respect, he changed the conversation
to the theme that haunted him.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp might chaff the Colonel about his <i>idée fixe</i>,
but he, too, like most men of his class, had the fear of
Germany constantly before his eyes and liked nothing
better than to discuss the familiar topic with his friend over
a cigar.
</p>
<p>
"Well, how are we getting on?" he asked encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
"Not so bad," the Colonel answered through the smoke.
"Haldane's sent for Haig from India."
</p>
<p>
"Who's Haig?" puffed the other.
</p>
<p>
"Haig's a soldier who was at Oxford," the Colonel
answered.  "You didn't know there was such a variety,
did you?"
</p>
<p>
"Never mind about Oxford," grunted the great surgeon.
"Oxford turns out as many asses as any other institution
so far as I can see.  Does he know his job?  That's the
point."
</p>
<p>
"As well as you can expect a soldier to know it," replied
the other, still in the ironic vein.  "Sound but slow's his
reputation.  He and Haldane are the strongest combination
there's been at the War Office in my time."  He added
more seriously—"They ought to get a move on between
'em, if anybody can."
</p>
<p>
"In time?" asked Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, in spite of the recurrent waves of despair,
which inundated him, was at heart an unrepentant optimist.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see why not," he said.  "Bobs says Germany
can't strike till the Kiel Canal's open for battleships.
That won't be till 1912 or so."
</p>
<p>
The old doctor moved into the card-room with a cough.
</p>
<p>
"Gives you time to get on with your job, too, Colonel,"
he said.  "I wish you well.  Good-night."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was retired now; but his brain was as
active as ever, his heart as big, if his body was no longer so
sure an instrument as it once had been.  And Lord Roberts,
when he asked his old comrade in arms to undertake work
which he did not hesitate to describe as vital to the Empire,
knew that the man to whom he was appealing possessed
<i>in excelsis</i> the quality which has always made the British
Army the nursery of spirits who put the good of the Service
before their own advancement.  The little old hero, like all
great soldiers, had his favourite regiments, the result of
association and experience; and it was well known that the
Hammer-men stood at the top of the list.  Fifty years
before the date of this story they had sweated with him on
the Ridge before Delhi; under his eyes had stormed the
Kashmir Gate; with him had watched Nicholson die.
Twenty years later they had gone up the Kurrum with the
young Major-General, and made with him the famous
march from Kabul to Kandahar.  Another twenty years
and they were making the pace for the old Field Marshal in
the great trek from Paardeberg to Bloemfontein.  He
knew most of the officers, some of them intimately.  And
on hearing that Jocko Lewknor had settled down at
Beachbourne wrote at once and asked him to become Secretary
of the local branch of the National Service League, which
existed to establish in England universal military training
on the lines of Switzerland's Militia.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel made one of his rare trips to London and
lunched at the Rag with the leader who had been his hero
ever since as a lad he had gone up the Peiwar Khotal with
the First Hammer-men at the order of Bahadur Bobs.
</p>
<p>
The Field Marshal opened the Colonel's eyes to the
danger threatening the Empire.
</p>
<p>
"The one thing in our favour is this," he said, as they
parted at the hall-door.  "We've yet time."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, inspired with new life, returned to Beachbourne
and told his wife.  She listened with vivid interest.
</p>
<p>
"You've got your work cut out, my Jocko," she said.
"And I shan't be able to help you much."
</p>
<p>
"No," replied the Colonel.  "You must stick to the
hostel.  I'll plough my own furrow."
</p>
<p>
Forthwith he set to work with the quiet tenacity peculiar
to him.  From the start he made surprising headway,
perhaps because he was so unlike the orthodox product
of the barrack-square; and like his leader he eschewed
the party politics he had always loathed.
</p>
<p>
When he took up the work of the League he found it
one of the many non-party organisations, run solely by the
Conservatives quartered in Meads and Old Town, because,
to do them justice, nobody else would lend a hand.
Liberalism, camped in mid-town about Terminus Road,
was sullenly suspicious; Labour, at the East-end, openly
hostile.  The opposition of Liberalism, the Colonel soon
discovered, centred round the leader of Nonconformity in
the town, Mr. Geddes, the powerful Presbyterian minister
at St. Andrew's; the resistance of Labour, inchoate as yet
and ineffective as the Labour Party from which it sprang,
was far more difficult to tackle as being more vague and
imponderable.
</p>
<p>
In those days, always with the same end in view, the
Colonel spent much time in the East-end, winding his way
into the heart of Industrial Democracy.  He sloughed some
old prejudices and learnt some new truths, especially the
one most difficult for a man of his age and tradition to
imbibe—that he knew almost nothing of modern England.
Often on Sundays he would walk across from Meads to
Sea-gate and spend his afternoon wandering in the Recreation
Ground, gathering impressions on the day that Labour
tries to become articulate.
</p>
<p>
On one such Sunday afternoon he came on a large old
gentleman in gold spectacles, fair linen, and roomy tailcoat,
meandering on the edge of a dirty and tattered crowd
who were eddying about a platform.  The old gentleman
seemed strangely out of place and delightfully unconscious
of it; wandering about, large, benevolent and undisturbed,
like a moon in a stormy sky.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Caspar," said the Colonel quietly.  "What
do you make of it all?"
</p>
<p>
The large soft man turned his mild gaze of a cow in calf
on the lean tall one at his side.  It was clear he had no
notion who the speaker was; or that they had been at
Trinity together forty years before.
</p>
<p>
"To me it's extraordinarily inspiring," he said with an
earnestness that was almost ridiculous.  "I feel the
surge of the spirit beating behind the bars down here as
I do nowhere else....  It fills me with an immense
hope."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, standing by the other like a stick beside a
sack, sighed.
</p>
<p>
"They fill <i>me</i> with a fathomless despair," he said gently.
"One wants to help them, but they won't let you."
</p>
<p>
The other shook a slow head.
</p>
<p>
"I don't look at it like that," he replied.  "I go to them
for help."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel made a little moue.
</p>
<p>
"D'you get it?" he asked
</p>
<p>
"I do," Mr. Caspar replied with startling conviction.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel moved sorrowfully upon his way.  He was
becoming a man of one idea—Germany....
</p>
<p>
A few nights later, after supper, he strolled up Beau-nez
under a harvest-moon spreading silvery wings moth-like
over earth and sea.  He was full of his own thoughts, and
and for once heavy, almost down-hearted, as he took up
his familiar post of vigil beside the flagstaff on the Head and
looked out over the shining waters.  The Liberals were
moving at last, it seemed.  The great cry for Dreadnoughts,
more Dreadnoughts,
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>We want eight!<br>
  We won't wait!</i><br>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
had gone up to the ears of Government from millions of
middle-class homes; but the Working Man still slept.
</p>
<p>
Would nothing rouse him to the Terror that stalked by
night across those quiet waters? ... The Working
Man, who would have to bear the brunt of it when the
trouble came....  The Working Man...?
</p>
<p>
The Head was deserted save for the familiar goat
tethered outside the coast-guard station.  The moon
beamed down benignantly on the silver-sabled land,
broad-bosomed about him, and the waters stirring far beneath him
with a rustle like wind in corn.  Then he heard a movement
at his back, and turned to see behind him, shabby, collarless,
sheepish, the very Working Man of whom he had been
thinking.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel regarded the mystic figure, gigantic in the
moonlight, a type rather than an individual, with an interest
that was half compassionate and half satirical.
</p>
<p>
<i>Yes.  That was the feller!  That was the chap who would
take it in the neck!  That man with the silly smile—God help
him!</i>
</p>
<p>
"<i>Come to look for it?</i>" he said to the shadow, half to
himself—"<i>wiser than your kind?</i>"
</p>
<p>
"<i>Look for what, sir?</i>"
</p>
<p>
"<i>The Creeping Death that's stealing across the sea to
swallow you and yours.</i>"
</p>
<p>
The shadow sidled towards him.
</p>
<p>
"Is that you, sir?" a voice said.  "I thought it were."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel emerged from his dream.
</p>
<p>
"What, Caspar!" he replied.  "What are you doing up
here at this time of night?"
</p>
<p>
"Just come up for a look round before turning in, me
and my wife, sir," the other answered.  "Ruth," he called,
"it's the Colonel."
</p>
<p>
A young woman with an orange scarf about her hair
issued from the shadow of the coast-guard station and came
forward slowly.
</p>
<p>
"I've heard a lot about you from Ern, sir," she said
in a deep voice that hummed like a top in the silvery silence.
"When you commanded his battalion in India and all."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, standing in the dusk, listened with a deep
content as to familiar music, the player unseen; and was
aware that his senses were stirred by a beauty felt rather
than seen......  Then he dropped down the hill
to the hostel twinkling solitary in the coombe beneath.
</p>
<p>
"Your friend Caspar's married," he told his wife on
joining her in the loggia.  The little lady scoffed.
</p>
<p>
"Married!" she cried.  "He's been married nearly a
year.  They spent their honeymoon on the hill at the back
last autumn.  I could see them from my room."
</p>
<p>
"Why ever didn't you tell me?" asked the Colonel.
"I'd have run em in for vagrancy."
</p>
<p>
"No, you wouldn't," answered Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
"Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"Because, my Jocko, she's a peasant Madonna.  You
couldn't stand up against her.  No man could."
</p>
<p>
"A powerful great creature from what I could see of her,"
the Colonel admitted.  "A bit of a handful for Master Ernie,
I should guess."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor's fine face became firm.  She thought
she scented a challenge in the words and dropped her eyes
to her work to hide the flash in them.
</p>
<p>
"Ernie'll hold her," she said.  "He could hold any
woman.  He's a gentleman like his father before him."
</p>
<p>
He reached a long arm across to her as he sat and
raised her fingers to his lips.
</p>
<p>
Years ago a bird had flashed across the vision of his
wife, coming and going, in and out of the darkness, like
the sparrow of the Saxon tale; but this had been no
sparrow, rather a bird of Paradise.  The Colonel knew that;
and he knew that the fowler who had loosed the jewel-like
bird was that baggy old gentleman who lived across the
golf links in the little house that overlooked the Rectory.
He knew and understood: for years ago the same bird had
flashed with radiant wings across the chamber of his life
too, swiftly coming, swiftly going.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE COLONEL LEARNS A SECRET
</h3>
<p>
If the Colonel in his missionary efforts for the National
Service League made little impression on the masses in the
East-end, he was astonishingly successful with such labour
as existed in Old Town; which in political consciousness
lagged fifty years behind its tumultuous neighbour on the
edge of the Levels, and retained far into this century much
of the atmosphere of a country village.  There the Church
was still a power politically, and the workers disorganised.
The Brewery in the Moot and the Southdown Transport
Company were the sole employers of labour in the bulk;
and Mr. Pigott the only stubborn opponent of the
programme of the League.
</p>
<p>
Archdeacon Willcocks backed the Colonel with whole-hearted
ferocity, and lent him the services of the Reverend
Spink, who, flattered at working with a Colonel D.S.O.,
showed himself keen and capable, and proposed to run the
Old Town branch of the League in conjunction with the
Church of England's Men's Society.
</p>
<p>
"I've got a first-rate secretary as a start," he told the
Colonel importantly.
</p>
<p>
"Who's that?"
</p>
<p>
"Caspar."
</p>
<p>
"Ernest Caspar!" cried the Colonel.  "The old
Hammer-man!"
</p>
<p>
"No, his brother.  Twice the man.  Alfred—Mr. Trupp's
chauffeur."
</p>
<p>
A few days later, when leaving the curate's lodgings,
the Colonel ran up against Ernie in Church Street.
</p>
<p>
"Your brother's joined us," he said.  "Are you
going to?"
</p>
<p>
Ernie's charming face became sullen at once.
</p>
<p>
"I would, sir," he said.  "Only for that."
</p>
<p>
"Only for what?"
</p>
<p>
"Alf."
</p>
<p>
"You won't join because your brother has!" grinned
the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
Ernie rolled a sheepish head.
</p>
<p>
"It's my wife, sir," he muttered.  "See, he persecutes
her somethink shameful."
</p>
<p>
Next afternoon the Colonel was crossing Saffrons Croft
on his way to the Manor-house for tea, when a majestic
young woman, a baby in her arms, sauntering under the elms
watching the cricket, smiled at him suddenly.
</p>
<p>
He stopped, uncertain of her identity.
</p>
<p>
"I'm Mrs. Caspar, sir," she explained.  "We met you
the other night on the Head—Ern and me."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I know all about you!" replied the Colonel, glancing
at the baby who lifted to the sky a face like a sleeping
rose.  "My word!—she's a bonny un."
</p>
<p>
"She grows, sir," replied Ruth, cooing and contented.
"We gets her all the air we can.  So we come here with
the children for a blow of the coolth most in general
Saraday afternoons.  More air than in the Moot."
</p>
<p>
"Where's Caspar?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Yonder under the ellums, sir, along with a friend.
Come about the classes or something I did hear."
</p>
<p>
"The class-war?" asked the Colonel grimly.
</p>
<p>
"No, sir," answered Ruth.  "Classes for learning you
learning, I allow.  Man from the North, I yeard say.  Talks
funny—foreign talk I call it."
</p>
<p>
Just then the Colonel's glance fell on a child, slim as a
daisy stalk, and with the healthy pallor of a wood-anemone,
hiding behind Ruth's skirt and peeping at the stranger with
fearless blue eyes that seemed somehow strangely familiar.
</p>
<p>
"And what's your name, little Miss Hide-away?" he
asked, delighted.
</p>
<p>
"Little Alice," the child replied, bold and delicate as a
robin.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the child was obviously some four years old
while Ernie had not been married half that time did not
occur to the Colonel as strange.  He glanced at the young
mother, noble in outline, and in her black and red beauty
of the South so unlike the child.
</p>
<p>
"She doesn't take after her mother and father," he said,
with the reckless indiscretion of his sex.
</p>
<p>
Then he saw his mistake.  Ruth has run up signals of
distress.  Ernie, who had now joined them, as always at
his best in an emergency, came quickly to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
"Favours her grandmother, sir, I say," he remarked.
</p>
<p>
"Like my boy," commented the Colonel, recovering
himself.  "I don't think anybody'd have taken our Jock
for his father's son when he joined us at Pindi in
1904—eh, Caspar?"
</p>
<p>
The two old Hammer-men chatted over days in India.
Then the Colonel went on up the hill, the eyes of the child
still haunting him.
</p>
<p>
The Manor-house party were having tea on the lawn,
under the laburnum, looking over the sunk fence on to
Saffrons Croft beyond, when the Colonel joined them.
Mrs. Lewknor was already there; and young Stanley
Bessemere, the Conservative candidate for Beachbourne
East.  He and Bess were watching a little group of people
gathered about a man who was standing on a bench in
Saffrons Croft haranguing.
</p>
<p>
"Lend me your bird-glasses, Miss Trupp," said her
companion eagerly.
</p>
<p>
He stood up, a fine figure of a man, perfectly tailored,
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said.  "I thought so.  It's my friend."
</p>
<p>
"Who's that?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Our bright particular local star of Socialism," the
other answered.  "The very latest thing from Ruskin
College.  I thought he confined himself to the East-end,
but I'm glad to find he gives you Old Towners a turn now
and then, Miss Trupp.  And I hope he won't forget you up
at Meads, Colonel."
</p>
<p>
"What's his name?" asked Bess, amused.
</p>
<p>
"Burt," replied the other.  "He comes from the
North—and he's welcome to go back there to-morrow so
far as I'm concerned."
</p>
<p>
"You're from the North yourself, Mr. Bessemere,"
Mrs. Trupp reminded him.
</p>
<p>
"I am," replied the young man, "and proud of it.
But for political purposes, I prefer the South.  That's why
I'm a candidate for Beachbourne East."
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later he took his departure.  The Colonel
watched him go with a sardonic grin.  Philosopher though
he might be, he was not above certain of the prejudices
common to his profession, and possessed in an almost
exaggerated degree the Army view of all politicians as the
enemies of Man at large and of the Services in particular.
</p>
<p>
Bess was still observing through her glasses the little
group about the man on the bench.
</p>
<p>
"There's Ruth!" she cried—"and Ernie!"
</p>
<p>
"Listening to the orator?" asked the Colonel, joining her.
</p>
<p>
"Not Ruth!" answered Bess with splendid scorn.
"No orators for her, thank you!—She's listening to the
baby.  Ernie can listen to him."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel took the glasses and saw Ruth and Ernie
detach themselves from the knot of people and come slowly
up the hill making for Borough Lane.
</p>
<p>
"That really is a magnificent young woman of Caspar's,"
he said to his host.
</p>
<p>
"She's one in a million," replied the old surgeon.
</p>
<p>
"William's always been in love with her," said his wife.
</p>
<p>
"All the men are," added Mrs. Lewknor, with a
provocative little nod at her husband.
</p>
<p>
"Where did he pick up his pearl?" asked the Colonel.
"I love that droning accent of hers.  It's like the music
of a rookery."
</p>
<p>
"She can ca-a-a away with the best of them when she
likes," chuckled Bess.  "You should hear her over the
baby!"
</p>
<p>
"An Aldwolston girl," said Mrs. Trupp.  "She's Sussex
to the core—with that Spanish strain so many of them
have."  She added with extreme deliberation,—"She was at the
Hohenzollern for a bit one time o day, as we say in these parts."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor coloured faintly and looked at her feet.
Next to her Jocko and his Jock the regiment was the most
sacred object in her world.  But the harm was done.  The
secret she had guarded so long even from her husband was
out.  The word Hohenzollern had, she saw, unlocked the
door of the mystery for him.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the Colonel recalled Captain Royal's stay at
the hotel on the Crumbles a few years before ... Ernie
Caspar's service there ... the clash of the two men
on the steps of the house where he was now having tea
... Royal's sudden flight, and the rumours that had
reached him of the reasons for it.
</p>
<p>
The eyes which had looked at him a few minutes since
in Saffrons Croft from beneath the fair brow of little Alice
were the eyes of his old adjutant.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Trupp's voice broke in upon his reverie.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said the old surgeon, "I see you know."
</p>
<p>
"And I'm glad you should," remarked Mrs. Trupp
with the almost vindictive emphasis that at times
characterised this so gentle woman.
</p>
<p>
"Everybody does, mother," Bess interjected quietly...
</p>
<p>
As the Colonel and his wife walked home across the
golf links he turned to her.
</p>
<p>
"Did you know that, Rachel?" he inquired.
</p>
<p>
She looked straight in front of her as she walked.
</p>
<p>
"I did, my Jocko ... Mrs. Trupp told me."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel mused.
</p>
<p>
"What a change!—from Royal to Caspar!" he said.
</p>
<p>
She glanced up at him.
</p>
<p>
"You don't understand, Jocko," she said quietly.
"Ruth was never Royal's mistress.  She was a maid on the
Third Floor at the Hohenzollern when he was there.  He
simply raped her and bolted."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel shrugged.
</p>
<p>
"Like the cad," he said.
</p>
<p>
They walked on awhile.  Then the Colonel said more to
himself than to his companion,
</p>
<p>
"I wonder if she's satisfied?"
</p>
<p>
The little lady at his side made a grimace that
suggested—"Is any woman?"
</p>
<p>
But all she said was,
</p>
<p>
"She's a good woman."
</p>
<p>
"She's come a cropper once," replied the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"She was tripped," retorted the other almost tartly.
"She didn't fall."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE MAN FROM THE NORTH
</h3>
<p>
A few days later, on a Saturday afternoon, the Colonel was
sitting in the loggia of the hostel looking out over the sea
when he saw two men coming down the shoulder of Beau-nez
along the coast-guard path.
</p>
<p>
The tall man in black with flying coat-tails he
recognised at once.  It was Mr. Geddes, the one outstanding
minister of the Gospel in Beachbourne: a scholar, yet in
touch with his own times, eloquent and broad, with a more
than local reputation as a Liberal leader.  His companion
was a sturdy fellow in a cap, with curly black hair and
a merry eye.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, who never missed a chance, went out to
waylay the pair.  Mr. Geddes introduced his friend—Mr. Burt,
who'd come down recently from Mather and Platt's
in the North to act as foreman fitter at Hewson and
Clarke's in the East-end.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel reached out a bony hand, which the other
gripped fiercely.
</p>
<p>
"I know you're both conspirators," he said with a wary
smile.  "What troubles are you hatching for me now?"
</p>
<p>
Mr. Geddes laughed, and the engineer, surly a little
from shyness and self-conscious as a school-boy, grinned.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Burt and I are both keen on education," said the
minister.  "He's been telling me of Tawney's tutorial
class at Rochdale.  We're hatching a branch of the
W.E.A. down here.  That's our only conspiracy."
</p>
<p>
"What's the W.E.A.?" asked the Colonel, always keen.
</p>
<p>
"It's the Democratic wing of the National Service
League," the engineer answered in broad
Lancashire—"Workers' Education Association."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel nodded.
</p>
<p>
"He's getting at me!" he said.  "I'm always being
shot at.  Will you both come in to tea and talk?—I should
like you to meet my wife, Burt.  She'll take you on.  She's
a red-hot Tory and a bonnie fighter."
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Geddes had a committee, and—"A must get on
with the Revolution," said Burt gravely.
</p>
<p>
"What Revolution's that?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"The Revolution that begun in 1906—and that's been
going on ever since; and will go on till we're through!"  He
said the last words with a kind of ferocity; and then burst
into a sudden jovial roar as he saw the humour of his own
ultra-seriousness.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor, who had been watching the interview
from the loggia, called to her husband as he returned to
the house.
</p>
<p>
"Who was that man with Mr. Geddes?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Stanley Bessemere's friend," the Colonel answered.
"A red Revolutionary from Lancasheer—on the bubble;
and a capital good fellow too, I should say."
</p>
<p>
That evening the Colonel rang up Mr. Geddes to ask
about the engineer.
</p>
<p>
"He's the new type of intellectual artizan," the minister
informed him.  "The russet-coated captain who knows
what he's fighting for and loves what he knows.  Unless
I'm mistaken he's going to play a considerable part in our
East-end politics down here."  He gave the other the
engineer's address, adding with characteristic breadth,
</p>
<p>
"It might be worth your while to follow him up
perhaps, Colonel."
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt lodged in the East-end off Pevensey Road in
the heart of the new and ever-growing industrial quarter
of Seagate, which was gradually transforming a rather
suburban little town of villas with a fishing-station attached
into a manufacturing city, oppressed with all the thronging
problems of our century.  There the Colonel visited his
new friend.  Burt was the first man of his type the old
soldier, who had done most of his service in India, had met.
The engineer himself, and even more the room in which he
lived, with its obvious air of culture, was an eye-opener
to the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
There was an old sideboard, beautifully kept, and on it
a copper kettle and spirit lamp; a good carpet, decent
curtains.  On the walls were Millais's <i>Knight Errant</i>,
Greiffenhagen's <i>Man with a Scythe</i>, and Clausen's <i>Girl at
the Gate</i>.  But it was the books on a long deal plank that
most amazed the old soldier; not so much the number of
them but the quality.  He stood in front of them and read
their titles with grunts.
</p>
<p>
Alfred Marshall's <i>Principles of Economics</i> lolled up against
the Webbs' <i>Industrial Democracy</i>; Bradley's lectures on
the tragedies of Shakespeare hobnobbed with Gilbert
Murray's translations from Euripides.  Few of the standard
books on Economics and Industrial History, English or
American, were missing.  And the work of the modern
creators in imaginative literature, Wells, Shaw, Arnold
Bennett were mixed with <i>Alton Locke</i>, <i>Daniel Deronda</i>,
<i>Sybil</i>, and the essays of Samuel Butler and Edward
Carpenter.
</p>
<p>
"You're not married then?" said the Colonel, throwing
a glance round the well-appointed room.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, A am though," the engineer answered, his
black-brown eyes twinkling.  "A'm married to Democracy.
She's ma first loov and like to be ma last."
</p>
<p>
"What you doing down South?" asked the Colonel,
tossing one leg over the other as he sat down to
smoke.
</p>
<p>
"Coom to make trouble," replied the other.
</p>
<p>
"Good for you!" said the Colonel.  "Hotting things
up for our friend Stan.  Well, he wants it.  All the
politicians do."
</p>
<p>
His first visit to Seagate Lane was by no means his last:
for the engineer's courage, his integrity, his aggressive
tactics, delighted and amused the scholarly old soldier;
but when he came to tackle his man seriously on the
business of the National Service League he found he could not
move him an inch from the position he invariably took up:
The Army would be used by the Government in the only
war that matters—the Industrial war; and therefore the
Army must not be strengthened.
</p>
<p>
"If the Army was used for the only purpose it ought to
be used for—defence—A'd be with you.  So'd the boolk of
the workers.  But it's not.  They use it to croosh strikes!"  And
he brought his fist down on the table with a characteristic
thump.  "That's to croosh us!—For the strike's
our only weapon, Colonel."
</p>
<p>
The power, the earnestness, even the savagery he displayed,
amazed the other.  Here was a reality, an elemental
force of which he had scarcely been aware.  This was
Democracy incarnate.  And whatever else he might think
he could not but admire the sincerity and strength of it.
But he always brought his opponent back to what was for
him the only issue.
</p>
<p>
"Germany!" he said.
</p>
<p>
"That's blooff!" replied the other.  "They'll get the
machine-guns for use against Germany, and when they've
got em they'll use them against us.  That's the capitalists'
game.—Then there's the officers."
</p>
<p>
"What about em?" said the Colonel cheerfully.
"They're harmless enough, poor devils."
</p>
<p>
"Tories to a man.  Coom from the capitalist class."
</p>
<p>
"What if they do?"
</p>
<p>
"The Army does what the capitalist officer tells it.
And he knows where his interest lies aw reet."
</p>
<p>
"Well, of course you know the British officer better than
I do, Burt," replied the Colonel, nettled for once.
</p>
<p>
His opponent was grimly pleased to have drawn blood.
</p>
<p>
"In the next few years if things go as they look like
goin we shall see," was his comment.  "Wait till we get a
Labour Government in power!"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel knocked out his pipe.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Burt, I'll say this," he remarked.  "If we could
get half the passion into our cause you do into yours, we
should do."
</p>
<p>
"We're fighting a reality, Colonel," the other answered.
"You're fighting a shadow, that's the difference."
</p>
<p>
"I hope to God it may prove so!" said the Colonel,
as they shook hands.
</p>
<p>
The two men thoroughly enjoyed their spars.  And the
battle was well matched: for the soldier of the Old Army
and the soldier of the New were both scholars, well-read,
logical, and fair-minded.
</p>
<p>
On one of his visits the Colonel found Ernie Caspar in
the engineer's room standing before the book-shelf, handling
the books.  Ernie showed himself a little shame-faced in
the presence of his old Commanding Officer.
</p>
<p>
"How do they compare to your father's, Caspar?"
asked the Colonel, innocently unaware of the other's
<i>mauvaise honte</i> and the cause of it.
</p>
<p>
"Dad's got ne'er a book now, sir," Ernie answered
gruffly.  "Only just the Bible, and Wordsworth, and
Troward's Lectures.  Not as he'd ever anythink like
this—only Carpenter.  See, dad's not an economist.  More
of a philosopher and poet like."
</p>
<p>
"I wish they were mine," said the Colonel, turning over
Zimmeni's <i>Greek Commonwealth</i>.
</p>
<p>
"They're all right if so be you can afford em," answered
Ernie shortly, almost sourly.
</p>
<p>
"Books are better'n beer, Ernie," said Joe Burt, a
thought maliciously; and added with the little touch of
priggishness that is rarely absent from those who have
acquired knowledge comparatively late in life—"They're
the bread of life and source of power."
</p>
<p>
"Maybe," retorted Ernie with a snort; "but they
aren't the equal of wife and children, I'll lay."
</p>
<p>
He left the room surlily.
</p>
<p>
Burt grinned at the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Ern's one o the much-married uns," he said.
</p>
<p>
"D'you know his wife?" the Colonel asked.
</p>
<p>
Joe shook his bull-head.
</p>
<p>
"Nay," he said.  "And don't wish to."
</p>
<p>
"She's a fine woman all the same," replied the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Happen so," the other answered.  "All the more
reason a should avoid her.  They canna thole me, the
women canna.  And A don't blame em."
</p>
<p>
"Why can't they thole you?" asked the Colonel curiously.
</p>
<p>
"Most Labour leaders rise to power at the expense of
their wives," the other explained.  "They go on; but the
wives stay where they are—at the wash-tub.  The women
see that; and they don't like it.  And they're right."
</p>
<p>
"What's the remedy?"
</p>
<p>
"There's nobbut one."  Joe now not seldom honoured
the Colonel by relapsing into dialect when addressing
him.  "And that's for the Labour leader to remain
unmarried.  They're the priests of Democracy—or should be."
</p>
<p>
"You'll never make a Labour leader out of Caspar,"
said the Colonel genially.  "I've tried to make an
N.C.O. of him before now and failed."
</p>
<p>
"A'm none so sure," Joe said, and added with genuine
concern: "He's on the wobble.  Might go up; might go
down.  Anything might happen to yon lad now.  He's
just the age.  But he's one o ma best pupils—if he'll nobbut
work."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said the Colonel with interest.  "So he's joined
your class at St. Andrew's Hall, has he?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied the other.  "Mr. Chislehurst brought
him along—the new curate in Old Town.  D'ye know him?"
</p>
<p>
"He's my cousin," replied the Colonel.  "I got him
here.  He'd been overworking in Bermondsey—in
connection with the Oxford Bermondsey Mission."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he's one of <i>them</i>!" cried the other.  "That
accounts for it.  A know <i>them</i>.  They were at Oxford when
A was at Ruskin.  They're jannock,—and so yoong with
it.  They think they're going to convert the Church to
Christianity!"  He chuckled.
</p>
<p>
"In the course of history," remarked the Colonel,
"many Churchmen have thought that.  But the end of
it's always been the same."
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked the engineer.
</p>
<p>
"That the Church has converted them."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE CHERUB
</h3>
<p>
The advent of Bobby Chislehurst to Old Town made a
considerable difference to Bessie Trupp.  She was not at
all in love with him and he only pleasantly so with her;
but as she told her friend the Colonel,
</p>
<p>
"He's the first curate we've ever had in Old Town you
can be like that with."
</p>
<p>
"Like that is good," said the Colonel.  "Give me my
tables.  Meet it is I write it down.—It says nothing and
expresses everything."
</p>
<p>
Now if the clergy in Old Town with the exception of
Bess's pet antipathy, the Reverend Spink, were honest men
worthy of respect, as everybody admitted, they were also
old-fashioned; and Bobby Chislehurst was a new and
disturbing element in their midst.  Shy and unassuming
though he was, the views of the Cherub, as the Colonel
called his cousin, when they became known, created something
of a mild sensation in the citadel which had been held
for Conservatism against all comers by the Archdeacon and
his lady for nearly forty years.
</p>
<p>
Even Mr. Pigott was shocked.
</p>
<p>
"He's a Socialist!" he confided to Mr. Trupp at the
Bowling Green Committee.
</p>
<p>
The old Nonconformist had passed the happiest hours
of a militant life in battle with the Church as represented
by his neighbour, the Archdeacon, but of late it had been
borne in upon him with increasing urgency that the time
might come when Church and Chapel would have to join forces
and present a common front against the hosts of Socialism
which he feared more than ever he had done the Tory legions.
</p>
<p>
But if the Church was going Socialist! ...
</p>
<p>
And Mr. Chislehurst said it was...
</p>
<p>
The new curate and Bess Trupp had much in common,
especially Boy Scouts, their youth and the outstanding
characteristic of their generation—a passionate interest
and sympathy for their poorer neighbours.  Both spent
laborious and happy hours in the Moot, listening a great deal,
learning much, even helping a little.  Bess, who had known
most of the dwellers in the hollow under the Kneb all her
life, had of course her favourites whom she commended to
the special care of Bobby on his arrival; and first of these
were the young Caspars.
</p>
<p>
She told him of Edward Caspar, her mother's old friend,
scholar, dreamer, gentleman, with the blood of the
Beauregards in his veins, who had married the daughter of an
Ealing tobacconist, and lived in Rectory Walk; of Anne
Caspar, the harsh and devoted tyrant; of the two sons of
this inharmonious couple, and the antagonism between them
from childhood; of Alf's victory and Ernie's enlistment in
the Army; his sojourn in India and return to Old Town
some years since; and she gave him a brief outline of
Ruth's history, not mentioning Royal's name but referring
once or twice through set teeth to "that little beast."
</p>
<p>
"Who's that?" asked the Cherub.
</p>
<p>
"Ernie's brother," she answered.  "Alfred, who drives
for dad."
</p>
<p>
"Not the sidesman?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
Bobby looked surprised.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Spink," Bess explained darkly.  "He got him there."
</p>
<p>
Apart from Bess's recommendation, Mr. Chislehurst's
contact with Ruth was soon established through little Alice,
who attended Sunday School.  Ruth, moreover, called herself
a church-woman, and was sedately proud of it, though
the Church had no apparent influence upon her life, and
though she never attended services.
</p>
<p>
On the latter point, the Cherub, when he had rooted
himself firmly in her regard, remonstrated.
</p>
<p>
"See, I ca-a-n't, sir," said Ruth simply.
</p>
<p>
"Why not?" asked Bobby.
</p>
<p>
"<i>He's</i> always there," Ruth answered enigmatically.
</p>
<p>
Bobby was puzzled and she saw it.
</p>
<p>
"Alf," she explained.  "See, he wanted me same as
Ernie.  Only not to marry me.  Just for his fun like and
then throw you over.  That's Alf, that is.  There's the
difference atween the two brothers."  She regarded the
young man before her with the lovely solicitude of the
mother initiating a sensitive son into the cruelties of a world
of which she has already had tragic experience.  "Men are
like that, sir—some men."  She added with tender delicacy,
"Only you wouldn't know it, not yet."
</p>
<p>
The Cherub might be innocent, but no man has lived and
worked in the back-streets of Bermondsey without learning
some strange and ugly truths about life and human nature.
</p>
<p>
"He's not worrying you now?" he asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing to talk on," answered Ruth.  "He wants
me still, I allow.  Only he won't get me—not yet a bit
anyways."  She seemed quite casual about the danger
that threatened her, Bobby noticed; even, he thought,
quietly enjoying it.
</p>
<p>
That evening, when the Cherub touched on the point
to his colleague, Mr. Spink turned in his india-rubber lips.
</p>
<p>
"It's an honour to be abused by a woman like that,"
he said.  "She's a bad character—bad."
</p>
<p>
"She's not that, I swear!" cried Bobby warmly.  "She
may have exaggerated, or made a mistake, but bad she's
not."
</p>
<p>
"I believe I've been in the parish longer than you have,
Chislehurst," retorted the other crisply.  "And presumably
I know something about the people in it."
</p>
<p>
"You've not been in as long as Miss Trupp," retorted
Bobby.  "She's been here all her life."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spink puffed at his cigar with uplifted chin and
smiled.
</p>
<p>
"How's it getting on?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Pah!" muttered Bobby—"Cad!" and went out,
rather white.
</p>
<p>
That was not the end of the matter, however.
</p>
<p>
A few days later Joe Burt and Bobby had paused for a
word at the <i>Star</i> corner when Mr. Spink and Alf Caspar
came down Church Street together.
</p>
<p>
"Birds of a feather," said Alf loudly, nudging his
companion, just as they passed the standing couple.
</p>
<p>
"That's not very courteous, Caspar," called Bobby
quietly after him.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spink walked on with a smirk; but Alf came back
with hardly dissimulated truculence.
</p>
<p>
"Sorry you've been spreading this about me,
Mr. Chislehurst," he said, his sour eyes blinking.
</p>
<p>
"What?" asked the Cherub, astonished.
</p>
<p>
"Dirt," Alf retorted.  "And I know where you got it
from too."
</p>
<p>
"I haven't," cried Bobby with boyish indignation.
"What d'you mean?"
</p>
<p>
"I know you have though," retorted Alf.  "So it's no
good denying it."  He was about to move on with a sneer
when Joe Burt struck in.
</p>
<p>
"That's a foonny way to talk," he said.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Foonny</i> it may be," mocked Alf.  "One thing I'll lay:
it's not so <i>foonny</i> as your lingo."
</p>
<p>
The engineer shouldered a pace nearer.
</p>
<p>
"Throw a sneer, do you?"
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Alf, secure in the presence of the clergyman.
"I know all about <i>you</i>."
</p>
<p>
"Coom to that," retorted the Northerner, "I know a
little about you.  One o Stan's pups, aren't you?"
</p>
<p>
Bobby moved on and Alf at once followed suit.
</p>
<p>
"You keep down in the East-end, my lad!" he called
over his shoulder.  "We don't want none of it in Old
Town.  Nor we won't have it, neether."
</p>
<p>
Joe stood four-square at the cross-roads, bristling like
a dog.
</p>
<p>
"Called yourself a Socialist when yo were down,
didn't you?" he shouted.  "And then turned Church and
State when yo began to make.  I know your sort!"
</p>
<p>
He dropped down Borough Lane, hackles still up, on the
way to meet Ernie by appointment in the Moot.
</p>
<p>
At the corner he waited, one eye on Ern's cottage,
which he did not approach.  Then Ruth's face peeped round
her door, amused and malicious, to catch his dark head
bobbing back into covert as he saw her.  The two played <i>I spy</i>
thus most evenings to the amusement of one of them at least.
</p>
<p>
"He's there," she told Ernie in the kitchen—"Waitin
at the corner.—Keeps a safe distance, don't he?—What's
he feared on?"
</p>
<p>
"You," answered Ernie, and rose.
</p>
<p>
Ruth snorted.  The reluctance to meet her of this man
with the growing reputation as a fighter amused and
provoked her.  Sometimes she chaffed with Ernie about it;
but a ripple of resentment ran always across her laughter.
</p>
<p>
Ern now excused his friend.
</p>
<p>
"He's all for his politics," he said.  "No time for women."
</p>
<p>
"Hap, he'll learn yet," answered Ruth with a fierce little
nod of her head.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE SHADOW OF ROYAL
</h3>
<p>
That evening Alf called at Bobby's lodgings and
apologised frankly.
</p>
<p>
"I know I said what I shouldn't, sir," he admitted.
"But it fairly tortured me to see you along of a chap
like that Burt."
</p>
<p>
"He's all right," said Bobby coldly.
</p>
<p>
Alf smiled that sickly smile of his.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you're innocent, Mr. Chislehurst," he said.  "Only
wish I knew as little as you do."
</p>
<p>
Alf in fact was moving on and up again in his career;
walking warily in consequence, and determined to do
nothing that should endanger his position with the powers
that be.  This was the motive that inspired his apology to
Mr. Chislehurst and caused him likewise to make approaches
to his old schoolmaster, Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
The old Nonconformist met the advances of his
erstwhile pupil with genial brutality.
</p>
<p>
"What's up now, Alf?" he asked.  "Spreading the
treacle to catch the flies.  Mind ye don't catch an hornet
instead then!"
</p>
<p>
The remark may have been made in innocence, but Alf
looked sharply at the speaker and retired in some disorder.
His new stir of secret busyness was in fact bringing him into
contact with unusual company, as Mrs. Trupp discovered
by accident.  One evening she had occasion to telephone
on behalf of her husband to the garage.  A voice that
seemed familiar replied.
</p>
<p>
"Who's that?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
The answer came back, sharp as an echo,
</p>
<p>
"<i>Who's that?</i>"
</p>
<p>
"I'm Mrs. Trupp.  I want to speak to Alfred Caspar."
</p>
<p>
Then the voice muttered and Alfred took the receiver.
</p>
<p>
Later Mrs. Trupp told her husband of the incident.
</p>
<p>
"I'm <i>certain</i> it was Captain Royal," she said with
emphasis.
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon expressed no surprise.
</p>
<p>
"I daresay," he said.  "Alf's raising money for some
business scheme.  He told me so."
</p>
<p>
Now if Alf's attempts on Ruth in the days between the
birth of the child and her marriage to Ernie were known to
Mrs. Trupp, the connection of the little motor-engineer and
Royal was only suspected by her.  A chance word of Ruth's
had put her on guard; and that was all.  Now with the
swift natural intuition for the ways of evil-doers, which the
innocent woman, once roused, so often reveals as by miracle,
she flashed to a conclusion.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's blackmailing him!" she said positively.
</p>
<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised," her husband answered calmly.
</p>
<p>
His wife put her hand upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"How <i>can</i> you employ a man like that, William?"
she said, grave and grieved.
</p>
<p>
It was an old point of dispute between them.  Now he
took her hand and stroked it.
</p>
<p>
"My dear," he said, "when a bacteriologist has had a
unique specimen under the microscope for years he's not
going to abandon it for a scruple."
</p>
<p>
A few days later Mrs. Trupp was walking down Borough
Lane past the <i>Star</i> when she saw Alf and Ruth cross each
other on the pavement fifty yards in front.  Neither stopped,
but Alf shot a sidelong word in the woman's ear as he slid
by serpent-wise.  Ruth marched on with a toss of her
head, and Mrs. Trupp noted the furtive look in the eyes of
her husband's chaffeur as he met her glance and passed,
touching his cap.
</p>
<p>
Mindful of her conversation with her husband, she
followed Ruth home and boarded her instantly.
</p>
<p>
"Ruth," she asked, "I want to know something.  You
must tell me for your own good.  Alfred's got no hold over you?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth drew in her breath with the sound, almost a hiss, of a
sword snatched from its scabbard.  Then slowly she relaxed.
</p>
<p>
"He's not got the sway over me not now," she said in
a still voice, with lowered eyes.  "Only thing he's the only one
outside who knaws Captain Royal's the father of little Alice."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp eyed her under level brows.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he does know that?" she said.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was pale.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, 'M," she said.  "See Alf used to drive him
that summer at the Hohenzollern."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp was not entirely satisfied.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see how Alfred can hold his knowledge over
you," she remarked.
</p>
<p>
"Not over me," answered Ruth, raising her eyes.
"Over him."
</p>
<p>
"Over who?"
</p>
<p>
"Captain Royal," said Ruth; and added slowly—"And
I'd be sorry for anyone Alf got into his clutches—let
alone her father."
</p>
<p>
Her dark eyes smouldered; her colour returned to her,
swarthy and glowing; a gleam of teeth revealed itself
between faintly parted lips.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp not for the first time was aware of a secret
love of battle and danger in this young Englishwoman
whose staid veins carried the wild blood of some remote
ancestress who had danced in the orange groves of Seville,
watched the Mediterranean blue flecked with the sails of
Barbary corsairs, and followed with passionate eyes the
darings and devilries of her matador in the ring among the
bulls of Andalusia.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp returned home, unquiet at heart, and with
a sense that somehow she had been baffled.  She knew
Ruth well enough now to understand how that young woman
had fallen a prey to Royal.  It was not the element of class
that had been her undoing, certainly not the factor of money:
it was the soldier in the man who had seized the girl's
imagination.  And Mrs. Trupp, daughter herself of a line
of famous soldiers, recognised that Royal with all his faults,
was a soldier, fine as a steel-blade, keen, thorough, searching.
It was the hardness and sparkle and frost-like quality of this
man with a soul like a sword which had set dancing the
girl's hot Spanish blood.  Royal was a warrior; and to
that fact Ruth owned her downfall.
</p>
<p>
Was Ernie a warrior too?
</p>
<p>
Not for the first time she asked herself the question as
she turned out of the Moot into Borough Lane.  And at
the moment the man of whom she was thinking emerged
from the yard of the Transport Company, dusty, draggled,
negligent as always, and smiling at her with kind eyes—too
kind, she sometimes thought.
</p>
<p>
As she crossed the road to the Manor-house Joe Burt
passed her and gave his cap a surly hitch by way of salute.
Mrs. Trupp responded pleasantly.  Her husband, she knew,
respected the engineer.  She herself had once heard him
speak and had admired the fire and fearlessness in him.
Moreover, genuine aristocrat that she was, she followed with
sympathy his lonely battle against the hosts of Toryism
in the East-end, none the less because she was herself a
Conservative by tradition and temperament.
</p>
<p>
<i>That</i> man was a warrior to be sure....
</p>
<p>
That evening the old surgeon dropped his paper and
looked over his pince-nez at his wife and daughter.
</p>
<p>
"My dears," he said, "I've some good news for you."
</p>
<p>
"I know," replied Bess, scornfully.  "Your Lloyd
George is coming down in January to speak on his
iniquitous Budget.  I knew that, thank you!"
</p>
<p>
"Better even than that," her father answered.  "Alfred
Caspar's leaving me of his own accord."
</p>
<p>
The girl tossed her skein of coloured silk to the ceiling
with a splendid gesture.
</p>
<p>
"Chuck-<i>her</i>-up!" she cried.  "Do you hear, mother?"
</p>
<p>
"I do," answered Mrs. Trupp severely.  "Better late
than never."
</p>
<p>
"And I'm losing the best chauffeur in East Sussex,"
Mr. Trupp continued.
</p>
<p>
Alf, indeed, who had paddled his little canoe for so long
and so successfully on the Beachbourne mill-pond, was
now about to launch a larger vessel on the ocean of the world
in obedience to the urge of that ambition which, apart from a
solitary lapse, had been the consuming passion of his life.
Unlike most men, however, who, as they become increasingly
absorbed in their own affairs, tend to drop outside interests,
he persisted loyally in old-time activities.  Whether it was
that his insatiable desire for power forbade him to abandon
any position, however modest, which afforded him scope; or
that he felt it more necessary than ever now, in the interests
of his expanding career, to maintain and if possible improve
his relations with the Church and State which exercised so
potent a control in the sphere in which he proposed to
operate; or that the genuinely honest workman in him
refused to abandon a job to which he had once put his hand,
it is the fact that he continued diligent in his office at
St. Michael's, and manifested even increased zeal in his labours
for the National Service League.
</p>
<p>
Alf, indeed, so distinguished himself by his services to
the League that at the annual meeting at the Town Hall,
he received public commendation both from the Archdeacon
and the Colonel, who announced that "the admirable and
indefatigable secretary of our Old Town branch, Mr. Alfred
Caspar, has agreed to become District Convener."
</p>
<p>
That meeting was a red-letter day in the history of the
Beachbourne National Service League, for at it the Colonel
disclosed that Lord Roberts was coming down to speak.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
BOBS
</h3>
<p>
The old Field-Marshal, wise and anxious as a great doctor,
was sitting now at the bedside of the patient that was his
country.  His finger was on her pulse, his eye on the
hourglass, the sands of which were running out; and he was
listening always for the padding feet of that Visitor whose
knock on the door he expected momentarily.
</p>
<p>
After South Africa he had sheathed at last the sword
which had not rested in its scabbard for fifty years; and
from that moment his eyes were everywhere, watching,
guiding, cherishing the movement to which he had given
birth.
</p>
<p>
He followed the activities and successes of Colonel
Lewknor on the South Coast with a close attention of which
the old Hammer-man knew nothing; and to show his
appreciation of the Colonel's labours, he volunteered to
come down to Beachbourne and address a meeting.
</p>
<p>
The offer was greedily accepted.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor, who, now that the hostel was in full
swing, was more free to interest herself in her husband's
concerns, flung herself into the project with enthusiasm.
And the Colonel went to work with tact and resolution.  On
one point he was determined: this should not be a
Conservative demonstration, run by the Tories of Old Town and
Meads.  Mr. Glynde, a local squire, the member for
Beachbourne West, might be trusted to behave himself.  But
young Stanley Bessemere, who, as the Colonel truly said,
was for thrusting his toe into the crack of every door, would
need watching—he and his cohorts of lady-workers.
</p>
<p>
The Committee took the Town Hall for the occasion,
and arranged for the meeting to be at eight in the
evening so that Labour might attend if it would.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel journeyed down to the East-end to ask
Joe Burt to take an official part in the reception; but the
engineer refused, to the Colonel's chagrin.
</p>
<p>
"A shall coom though," said Joe.
</p>
<p>
"And bring your mates along," urged the Colonel.
"The old gentleman's worth seeing at all events.
Mr. Geddes is coming."
</p>
<p>
"I was going to soop with Ernie Caspar and his missus,"
replied the engineer, looking a little foolish.  "And we were
coomin along together afterwards."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," laughed the Colonel, as he went out.  "She's
beat you!—I knew she would.  Back the woman!"
</p>
<p>
Joe grinned in the door.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said.  "Best get it over.  That's my notion
of it."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Bobs was still the most popular of Englishmen, if no
longer the figure of romance he had been in the eyes of the
British public for a few minutes during the South African
war.  His name drew; and the Town Hall was pleasantly
full without being packed.  Many came to see the old hero
who cared little for his subject.  Amongst these was Ruth
Caspar who at Ernie's request for once had left her babes
to the care of a friend.  She stood at the back of the hall
with her husband amongst her kind.  Mrs. Trupp, passing,
invited her to come forward; but Ruth had spied Alf at the
platform end, a steward with a pink rosette, very smart, and
deep in secret counsel with the Reverend Spink.  Joe Burt,
with critical bright eye everywhere, supported the wall next
to her.  The Colonel, hurrying by, threw a friendly glance
at him.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," he said, "so you've found each other."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir," replied Ruth mischievously.  "He's faced
me at last, Mr. Burt has."
</p>
<p>
"And none the worse for it, I hope," said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"That's not for me to say, sir," answered Ruth, who
was in gay mood.
</p>
<p>
Joe changed the subject awkwardly.
</p>
<p>
"A see young Bessemere's takin a prominent part in the
proceedings," he said, nodding towards the platform.
"He's two oughts above nothing, that young mon."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, young ass," replied the Colonel cheerfully.
"Now if you'd come on the Committee as I asked you,
you'd be there to keep him in his place.  You play into the
hands of your enemy!"
</p>
<p>
Then Bobby Chislehurst stopped for a word with Ruth
and Ernie and their friend.
</p>
<p>
"Coom, Mr. Chislehurst!" chaffed the engineer.  "A'm
surprised to see <i>you</i> here.  A thought you was a Pacifist."
</p>
<p>
"So I am," replied the other cheerily.  "That's why I've
come.  I want to hear both sides."
</p>
<p>
Joe shook his bullet-head gravely.
</p>
<p>
"There's nobbut two sides in life," he said.  "Right
and Wrong.  Which side is the Church on?"
</p>
<p>
Then the little Field-Marshal came on to the platform
with the swift and resolute walk of the old Horse-gunner.
He was nearly eighty now, but his figure was that of a youth,
neat, slight, alert.  Ruth remarked with interest that the
hero was bow-legged, which she did not intend her children
to be.  For the rest, his kindly face of a Roman-nosed
thoroughbred in training, his deep wrinkles, and
close-cropped white hair, delighted her.
</p>
<p>
The great soldier proved no orator; but his earnestness
more than compensated for his lack of eloquence.
</p>
<p>
After the meeting he came down into the body of the
hall and held an informal reception.  The Colonel introduced
Mr. Geddes, and left the two together while he edged
his way down to Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what d'you think of him?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The engineer, his hands glued to the wall behind him,
rocked to and fro.
</p>
<p>
"A like him better than his opinions," he grinned.
</p>
<p>
"You come along and have a word with him," urged the
Colonel.
</p>
<p>
Joe shook a wary head.
</p>
<p>
"He's busy with Church and State," he said, nodding
down the hall.  "He don't need Labour."
</p>
<p>
Then Ruth chimed in almost shrilly for once.
</p>
<p>
"There's young Alf shook hands with him!"
</p>
<p>
"Always shovin of issalf!" muttered Ernie sourly.
"He and Reverend Spink."
</p>
<p>
The old Field-Marshal was now coming slowly down the
hall with a word here and a handshake there.  Church and
State, as Joe had truly said, were pressing him.
Mrs. Trupp, indeed, and Mrs. Lewknor were fighting a heavy
rearguard action against the Archdeacon and Stanley
Bessemere and his cohorts, to cover the old soldier's retirement.
</p>
<p>
As the column drifted past Ernie and Ruth the Colonel
stopped.
</p>
<p>
"An old Hammer-man, sir," he said.  "And the mother
of future Hammer-men."
</p>
<p>
Lord Roberts shook hands with Ruth, and turned to
Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"What battalion?" he asked in his high-pitched
voice.
</p>
<p>
"First, sir," answered Ernie, rigid at attention, in a
voice Ruth had never heard before.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said the old Field-Marshal.  "They were with
me in the march to Kandahar.  Never shall I forget them!"  He
ran his eye shrewdly over the other.  "Are you keeping
fit?"
</p>
<p>
"Pretty fair, considering, sir," answered Ernie, relaxing
suddenly as he had braced.
</p>
<p>
"Well, you'll be wanted soon," said Bobs, and passed
on.  "How these men run to seed, directly they leave the
service, Lewknor!" he remarked to the Colonel on the stairs.
"Now I daresay that fellow was a smart upstanding man
when he was with you."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Ernie, thrilled at his adventure, went out into the cool
night with Ruth, quietly amused at his excitement, beside
him.
</p>
<p>
"Didn't 'alf look, Alf didn't, when he talked to you!"
chuckled Ruth.
</p>
<p>
That was the main impression she had derived from the
meeting, that and Lord Roberts's ears and the way they were
stuck on to his head; but Ernie's mind was still in tumult.
</p>
<p>
"Where's Joe then?" he cried suddenly, and turned to
see his pal still standing somewhat forlorn on the steps of
the Town Hall.
</p>
<p>
He whistled and beckoned furiously.
</p>
<p>
"Come on, Joe!" he called.  "Just down to the Wish
and have a look at the sea."
</p>
<p>
But the engineer shook his head and turned slowly
away down Grove Road.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, A know when A'm not wanted," he called.
"Yoong lovers like to be alone."
</p>
<p>
"Sauce!" said Ruth, marching on with a little smile.
</p>
<p>
Ernie rejoined her.
</p>
<p>
"What d'you think of him?" he asked keenly.
</p>
<p>
"O, I liked him," said Ruth, cool and a trifle mischievous.
"He's like a little bird—so alife like.  And that tag of white
beard to his chin like a billy-goat!—I did just want to
pluck it!"  She tittered and then recollected herself.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't mean Lord Roberts, fat-ead," retorted Ernie.
"I meant Joe."
</p>
<p>
"O, that chap!" answered Ruth casually.  "I didn't
pay much heed to him.  There's a lot o nature to him,
I should reckon.  Most in general there is—them black
chaps, bull-built, wi curly tops to em."
</p>
<p>
She drifted back to Lord Roberts and the meeting.
</p>
<p>
"Only all that about war!—I don't like that.  Don't
seem right, not to my mind.  There's a plenty enough
troubles seems to me without them a-shoving great wars on
top o you all for love."
</p>
<p>
Ernie felt that the occasion demanded a lecture and that
he was pointed out as the man to give it.  The chance,
moreover, might not recur; and he must therefore make the
most of it.  He had this feeling less often perhaps than most
men, and for that reason when he had it he had it strong.
At the moment he was profoundly aware of the immense
superiority of his sex; the political sagacity of Man; his
power of taking statesmanlike views denied apparently to
Woman.
</p>
<p>
"And what if Germany attacks us!" he asked censoriously.
"Take it laying down, I suppose!—Spread yourself
on the beach and let em tread on you as they land, so
they don't wet their feet!"
</p>
<p>
"Germany won't interfere with you if you don't interfere
with her, I reckon," Ruth answered calmly.  "It's just
the same as neighbours in the street.  You're friends or
un-friends, accordin as you like."
</p>
<p>
"What about Mrs. Ticehurst?" cried Ernie, feeling
victory was his for once.  "You didn't interfere with her,
did you?  Yet she tip the dust bin a-top o little Alice over
the back-wall—to show she loved you, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
Ruth tilted a knowing chin.
</p>
<p>
"She aren't a neighbour, Mrs. Ticehurst aren't—not
prarperly."
</p>
<p>
They were relapsing into broad Sussex as they always
would when chaffing.
</p>
<p>
"What are she then?"
</p>
<p>
"She's a cat, sure-ly."
</p>
<p>
The night air, the thronged and brilliant sky, the rare
change, the little bit of holiday, inspired and stimulated her.
The Martha of much busyness had given place to the girl
again.  Immersed in the splendid darkness, she was in a
delicious mood, cool, provocative, ironical; as Ernie had
known her in that brief April of her life before Captain
Royal had thrown a shadow across her path.
</p>
<p>
He threaded his arm through hers.  Together they
climbed the little Wish hill on the sea-front.  From the top,
by the old martello tower, they looked across the sea, white
beneath the moon.  Ernie's mood of high statesmanship
had passed already.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see this Creeping Death they talk on," he said
discontentedly.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," Ruth answered, sagacious in her turn.  "Hap
it's there though."
</p>
<p>
Ernie turned on her.
</p>
<p>
"I thart you just said..."
</p>
<p>
"No, I didn't then," she answered with magnificent
unconcern.  "All I say is—War and that, what's it got to
do wi' we?"
</p>
<p>
As they came off the hill they met Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor
crossing Madeira Walk on their way home.
</p>
<p>
"Where's your friend?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Gone back to his books and learning, sir, I reckon,"
replied Ruth.  "He don't want us."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you scared him, Mrs. Caspar," chaffed the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Scared him back to his revolution," commented Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
Ruth laughed that deep silvery bell-like laughter of
hers that seemed to make the night vibrate.
</p>
<p>
"He'd take some scaring, I reckon, that chap would,"
she said.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE RUSSET-COATED CAPTAIN
</h3>
<p>
Joe Burt had been born at Rochdale of a mother whose
favourite saying was:
</p>
<p>
"With a rocking-chair and a piece o celery a Lancasheer
lass is aw reet."
</p>
<p>
At eight, she had entered the mill, doffing.  Joe had
entered the same mill at about the same age, doffing too.
He worked bare-footed in the ring-room in the days when
overlookers and jobbers carried straps and used them.
</p>
<p>
When he was fifteen his mother died, and his father
married again.
</p>
<p>
"Thoo can fend for self," his step-mother told him
straightway, with the fine directness of the North.
</p>
<p>
Joe packed his worldly possessions in a chequered
handkerchief, especially his greatest treasure—a sixpenny
book bought off a second-hand bookstall at infinite cost to
the buyer and called <i>The Hundred Best Thoughts</i>.  Then
he crossed the common at night, falling into a ditch on the
way, to find the lodging-house woman who was to be his
mother for the next ten years drinking her Friday pint o
beer.  He was earning six shillings a week at the time in a
bicycle-shop.  Later he entered a big engineering firm and,
picking up knowledge as he went along, was a first-class
fitter when he was through his time.
</p>
<p>
Those were the days when George Barnes was Secretary
of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and leading the
great engineers' strike of the early nineties.  Labour was
still under the heel of Capital, but squealing freely.
Socialism, apart from a few thinkers, was the gospel of noisy
and innocuous cranks; and advanced working-men still
called themselves Radicals.
</p>
<p>
Young Joe woke up sooner than most to the fact that he
was the slave of an environment that was slowly throttling
him because it denied him opportunity to be himself—which
is to say to grow.  He discarded chapel for ever on finding
that his step-mother was a regular worshipper at Little
Bethel, and held in high esteem amongst the congregation.
He read Robert Blatchford in the <i>Clarion</i>, went to hear
Keir Hardie, who with Joey Arch was dodging in and out of
Parliament during those years, heralds of the advancing
storm, and took some part in founding the local branch of
the newly-formed Independent Labour Party.  When his
meditative spirit tired of the furious ragings of the Labour
Movement of those early days, he would retire to the Friends'
Meeting-house on the hill and ruminate there over the plain
tablet set in the turf which marks appropriately the resting
place of the greatest of modern Quakers.
</p>
<p>
The eyes of the intelligent young fitter were opening
fast now; and the death of the head of his firm completed
the process and gave him sight.
</p>
<p>
"Started from nothing.  Left £200,000.  Bequeathed
each of his servants £2 for every year of service; but
nothing for us as had made the money."
</p>
<p>
Joe was now a leading man in the local A.S.E.  His
Society recognised his work and sent him in the early years of
our century to Ruskin College, Oxford.  The enemies of that
institution are in the habit of saying that it spoils good
mechanics to make bad Labour leaders.  The original aim
of the College was to take men from the pit, the mill, the
shop, pour into them light and learning in the rich
atmosphere of the most ancient of our Universities, and then
return them whence they came to act amongst their fellows
as lamps in the darkness and living witnesses of the redeeming
power of education.  The ideal, noble in itself, appealed
to the public; but like many such ideals, it foundered on
the invincible rock of human nature.  The miners, weavers,
and engineers, who were the students, after their
year amid the towers and courts of Oxford, showed little
desire to return whence they came.  Rather they made their
newly-acquired power an instrument to enable them to
evade the suffocating conditions under which they were
born; and who shall blame them?  They became officials
in Labour Bureaux, Trade Union leaders, Secretaries of
Clubs, and sometimes the hangers-on of the wealthy
supporters of the Movement.
</p>
<p>
Burt was a shining exception to the rule.  At the end
of his academic year he returned to the very bench in the
very shop he had left a year before, with enlarged vision,
ordered mind, increased conviction; determined from that
position to act as Apostle to the Gentiles of the Old Gospel in
its new form.
</p>
<p>
He was the not uncommon type of intellectual artisan
of that day who held as the first article of his creed that no
working-man ought to marry under the economic
conditions that then prevailed; and that if Nature and
circumstance forced him to take a wife that he was not morally
justified in having children.  This attitude involving as it
inevitably must a levy on the only capital that is of enduring
value to a country—its Youth—was thrust upon thoughtful
workers, as Joe was never tired of pointing out, by the
patriotic class, who refused their employees the leisure, the
security, the material standards of life necessary to modern
man for his full development.
</p>
<p>
Joe practised what he preached, and was himself
unmarried.  Apart, indeed, from an occasional fugitive
physical connection as a youth with some passing girl,
he had never fairly encountered a woman; never sought
a woman; never, certainly, heard the call that refuses to
be denied, spirit calling to spirit, flesh to flesh, was never
even aware of his own deep need.  Women for him were
still a weakness to be avoided.  They were the necessaries
of the feeble, an encumbrance to the strong.  That was his
view, the view of the crude boy.  And he believed himself
lucky to be numbered among the uncalled for he was in
fact a sober fanatic, living as selflessly for his creed as ever
did those first preachers of unscientific Socialism, the
Apostles and Martyrs of the first centuries of our era.
Even in the shop he had his little class of students, pouring the
milk of the word into their ears as he set their machines, and
the missionary spirit drove him always on to fresh enterprise.
</p>
<p>
The Movement, as he always called it, was well ablaze
by the second decade of the century in the Midlands and
the North, but in the South it still only smouldered.
And when Hewson and Clarke started their aeroplane
department at Beachbourne, and began to build machines
for the Government, Joe Burt, a first-rate mechanic, leapt
at the chance offered him by the firm and crossed the
Thames with his books, his brains, his big heart, to carry
the Gospel of Redemption by Revolution to the men
of Sussex as centuries before, his spiritual ancestor,
St. Wilfrid, he too coming from the North, had done.  In that
strange land with its smooth-bosomed hills, its shining sea,
its ca-a-ing speech, he found everything politically as he
had expected.  And yet it was in the despised South that
he discovered the woman who was to rouse in him the fierce
hunger of which till then he had been unaware except as
an occasional crude physical need.
</p>
<p>
As on Saturday or Sunday afternoons at the time the
revelation was coming to him he roamed alone, moody and
unmated, the rogue-man, amid the round-breasted hills
he often paused to mark their resemblance to the woman
who was rousing in his deeps new and terrible forces of
which he had previously been unaware.  In her majestic
strength, her laughing tranquillity, even in her moods,
grave or gay, the spirit mischievously playing hide-and-seek
behind the smooth appearance, she was very much
the daughter of the hills amid which she had been bred.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was as yet deliciously unaware of her danger.
She was, indeed, unaware of any danger save that which
haunts the down-sitting and up-rising of every working
woman throughout the world—the abiding spectre of
insecurity.
</p>
<p>
She liked this big man, surly and self-conscious, and
encouraged his visits.  Not seldom as she moved amid her
cups and saucers in the back-ground of the kitchen, she
would turn eye or ear to the powerful stranger with the
rough eloquence sucking his pipe by the fire and holding
forth to Ernie on his favourite theme.  It flattered her
that he who notoriously disliked women should care to
come and sit in her kitchen, lifting an occasional wary
eyelid as he talked to look at her.  And when she caught his
glance he would scowl like a boy detected playing truant.
</p>
<p>
"I shan't hurt you then, Mr. Burt," she assured him
with the caressing tenderness that is mockery.
</p>
<p>
His chin sunk on his chest.
</p>
<p>
"A'm none that sure," he growled.
</p>
<p>
Ernie winked at Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"Call him Joe," he suggested.  "Then hap he'll be less
frit."
</p>
<p>
"Wilta?" asked Ruth, daintily mimicking the accent
of her guest.
</p>
<p>
"Thoo's mockin a lad," muttered Joe, delighted and
relapsing into broader Lancashire.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, ma lad," retorted Ruth.  "A dursena.  A'm
far ower scared."

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
RUTH WAKES
</h3>
<p>
Apart from such occasional sallies Ruth paid little attention
to her husband's friend or, indeed, to anything outside
her home.  Now that she had dropped her anchor in the
quiet waters of love sheltered by law, and had her recovered
self-respect to buttress her against the batterings of a
wayward world, she was snug, even perhaps a little selfish
with the self-absorption of the woman who is wrapped up
in that extension of herself which is her home, her children,
and the man who has given them her.
</p>
<p>
After her stormy flight she had settled down in her nest,
and seldom peeped over at the cat prowling beneath or at
anybody, indeed, but the cock-bird bringing back a grub
for supper; and him she peeped for pretty often.  She
was busy too with the unending busyness of the woman
who is her own cook, housekeeper, parlourmaid, nurse
and laundress.  And happily for her she had the qualities
that life demands of the woman who bears the world's
burden—a magnificent physique to endure the wear and
tear of it all, the invaluable capacity of getting on well with
her neighbours, method in her house, tact with her husband,
a way with her children.
</p>
<p>
And there was no doubt that on the whole she was happy.
The reaction from the <i>sturm-und-drang</i> period before her
marriage was passing but had not yet wholly passed.  Her
spirit still slept after the hurricane.  Naturally a little
indolent, and living freely and fully, if without passion,
her nature flowed pleasantly through rich pastures along
the channels grooved in earth by the age-long travail of the
spirit.
</p>
<p>
Jenny and little Ned followed Susie, just a year between
each child.  Ernie loved his children, especially always
the last for the time being; but the element of wonder
had vanished and with it much of the impetus that had
kept him steady for so long.
</p>
<p>
"How is it now?" asked his mate, on hearing of the
birth of the boy.
</p>
<p>
"O, it's all right," answered Ernie, wagging his head.
"Only it ain't quite the same like.  You gets used to it,
as the sayin is."
</p>
<p>
"And you'll get use-ter to it afore you're through,
you'll see," his friend answered, not without a touch of
triumphant bitterness.  He liked others to suffer what he
had suffered himself.
</p>
<p>
As little by little the romance of wife and children
began to lose its glamour, and the economic pressure steadily
increased, the old weakness began at times to re-assert
itself in Ernie.  He haunted the <i>Star</i> over much.  Joe
Burt chaffed him.
</p>
<p>
"Hitch your wagon to a star by all means, Ern," he
said.  "But not that one."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott too cautioned him once or twice, alike as
friend and employer.
</p>
<p>
"Family man now, you know, Ernie," he said.
</p>
<p>
The sinner was always disarming in his obviously
sincere penitence.
</p>
<p>
"I knaw I've unbuttoned a bit of late, sir," he admitted.
"I'll brace up.  I will and I can."
</p>
<p>
And at the critical moment the fates, which seemed as
fond of Ernie as was everybody else, helped him.
</p>
<p>
Susie, his first-born, caught pneumonia.  The shock
stimulated Ernie; as shock always did.  The steel that was
in him gleamed instantly through the rust.
</p>
<p>
"Say, we shan't lose her!" he asked Mr. Trupp in
staccato voice.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp knew Ernie, knew his weakness, knew human
nature.
</p>
<p>
"Can't say," he muttered.  "Might not."
</p>
<p>
Ern went to the window and looked out on the square
tower of the old church on the Kneb above him.  His
eyes were bright and his uncollared neck seemed strangely
long and thin.
</p>
<p>
"She's got to live," he muttered defiantly.
</p>
<p>
The doctor nodded grimly.
</p>
<p>
The Brute had pounced on Ernie sleeping and was
shaking him as a dog shakes a rat.  Mr. Trupp, who had
no intention of losing Susie, was by no means sorry.
</p>
<p>
"If it's got to be, it's got to be," said Ruth, busy with
poultices.  "Only it won't be if I can help it."
</p>
<p>
She was calm and strong as Ernie was fiercely resentful.
That angered Ernie, who was seeking someone to punish
in his pain.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Trupp had left he turned on Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"You take it cool enough!" he said with a rare sneer.
</p>
<p>
She looked at him, surprised.
</p>
<p>
"Well, where's the sense in wearin yourself into a
fret?" answered Ruth.  "That doosn't help any as I
can see."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, I knaw!" he said.  "You needn't tell me."
</p>
<p>
She put down the poultice and regarded him with eyes
in which there was a thought of challenge.
</p>
<p>
"What d'you knaw, Ern?"
</p>
<p>
There was something formidable about her very quiet.
</p>
<p>
"What I do, then," he said, and turned his back on
her.  "If it was somebody else, we should soon see."
</p>
<p>
She came to him, put her hand on his shoulder, and
turned him so that she could read his face.  He did not
look at her.
</p>
<p>
She turned slowly away, drawing in her breath as one
who rouses reluctantly from sleep.
</p>
<p>
"That's it, is it?" she said wearily.  "I thart it'd
come to that some day."
</p>
<p>
Just then little Alice danced in from the street, delicate,
pale sprite, with anemone-like health and beauty.
</p>
<p>
"Daddy-paddy!" she said, smiling up at him, as she
twined her fingers into his.
</p>
<p>
He bent and kissed her with unusual tenderness.
</p>
<p>
"Pray for our little Sue, Lal," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
The child looked up at him with fearless eyes of
forget-me-not blue.
</p>
<p>
"I be," she said.
</p>
<p>
He gave her a hand, and they went out together into
Motcombe Garden: for they were the best of friends.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was left.  In her heart she had always known
that this would come: he would turn on her some day.
And she did not blame him: she was too magnanimous.
Men were like that, men were.  They couldn't help
theirsalves.  Any one of them but Ernie would have thrown
her past up at her long before.  She was more grateful for
his past forbearance than resentful at his present vindictiveness.
Now that the blow, so long hovering above her in
the dimness of sab-consciousness, had fallen she felt the
pain of it, dulled indeed by the fact that she was already
suffering profoundly on Susie's account.  But the impact
braced her; and it was better so.  There was no life without
suffering and struggle.  If you faced that fact with your
eyes open, never luxuriating in the selfishness of
make-believe, compelling your teeth to meet on the granite
realities of life, then there would be no dreadful shock as you
fell out of your warm bed and rosy dreams into an icy pool.
</p>
<p>
Ruth went back to her hum-drum toil.  She had been
dreaming.  Now she must awake.  It was Ernie who had
roused her from that dangerous lethargy with a brutal slash
across the face; and she was not ungrateful to him.
</p>
<p>
When he returned an hour later with little Alice she was
unusually tender to him, though her eyes were rainwashed.
He on his side was clearly ashamed and stiff accordingly.
He said nothing; instead he was surly in self-defence.
</p>
<p>
To make amends he sat up with the child that night and
the next.
</p>
<p>
"Shall you save her, sir?" asked the scare-crow on the
third morning.
</p>
<p>
"I shan't," replied the doctor.  "Her mother may."
</p>
<p>
Next day when Mr. Trupp came he grunted the grunt,
so familiar to his patients, that meant all was well.
</p>
<p>
When the corner was turned Ern did not apologise to
Ruth, though he longed to do so; nor did she ask it of him.
To save himself without undergoing the humiliation of
penance, and to satisfy that most easily appeased of human
faculties, his conscience, he resorted to a trick ancient as
Man: he went to chapel.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott who had stood in that door at that hour
in that frock-coat for forty years past, to greet alike the
sinner and the saved, welcomed the lost sheep, who had
not entered the fold for months.
</p>
<p>
"I know what this means," he said, shaking hands.
"You needn't tell me.  I congratulate you.  Go in and
give thanks."
</p>
<p>
Ern bustled in.
</p>
<p>
"I shall come regular now, sir," he said.  "I've had my
lesson.  You can count on me."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Mr. Pigott, and said no more.
</p>
<p>
Next Sunday indeed he waited grimly and in vain
for the prodigal.
</p>
<p>
"Soon eased off," he muttered, as he closed the door
at last.  "One with a very sandy soil."
</p>
<p>
The Manager of the Southdown Transport Company
went home that evening to the little house on the Lewes Road
in unaccomodating mood.
</p>
<p>
"<i>His</i> trousers are coming down all right," he told his
wife.  "I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Once
you let go o God——"
</p>
<p>
"God lets go o you," interposed Mrs. Pigott.  "Tit
for tat."
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
NIGHTMARE
</h3>
<p>
A few days later on his way back to the Manor-house
from visiting his little patient in the Moot, the old surgeon
met Mr. Pigott, who stopped to make enquiries.
</p>
<p>
"She'll do now," said Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"And that fellow?"
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"Her father."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp looked at the windy sky, torn to shreds and
tatters by the Sou-west wind above the tower of the
parish-church.
</p>
<p>
"He wanted the Big Stick and he got it," he said.
"If it came down on his shoulders once a week regularly
for a year he'd be a man.  Steady pressure is what a fellow
like that needs.  And steady pressure is just what you
don't get in a disorganised society such as ours."
</p>
<p>
The old Nonconformist held up a protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
"You'd better go to Germany straight off!" he cried.
"That's the only place <i>you'd</i> be happy in."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp grinned.
</p>
<p>
"No need," he said, "Germany's coming here.  Ask
the Colonel!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" scolded the other.  "You and your Colonels!
You go and hear Norman Angell on the <i>Great Illusion</i> at
the Town Hall on Friday.  You go and hear a sensible
man talk sense.  That'll do you a bit of good.  Mr. Geddes
is going to take the chair."
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon turned on his way, grinning still.
</p>
<p>
"The Colonel's squared Mr. Geddes," he said.  "He's
all right now."
</p>
<p>
What Mr. Trupp told Mr. Pigott, more it is true in chaff
than in earnest, was partially true at least.  Liberalism was
giving way beneath the Colonel's calculated assault.  After
Lord Roberts's visit to Beachbourne the enemy dropped
into the lines of the besiegers sometimes in single spies and
sometimes in battalions.  Only Mr. Pigott held out
stubbornly, and that less perhaps from conviction than from
a sense of personal grievance against the Colonel.  For three
solid years the pugnacious old Nonconformist had been
trying to fix a quarrel on the man he wished to make his
enemy; but his adversary had eluded battle with grace and
agility.  That in itself happily afforded a good and
unforgiveable cause of offence.
</p>
<p>
"They won't fight, these soldiers!" he grumbled to
his wife.
</p>
<p>
"They leave that to you pacifists," replied the lady,
brightly.
</p>
<p>
"Pack o poltroons!" scolded the old warrior.  "One
can respect the Archdeacon at least because he has the courage
of his opinions.  But this chap!"
</p>
<p>
Yet if Liberalism as a whole was finding grace at last,
Labour in the East-end remained obdurate, as only a mollusc
can; and Labour was gaining power for all men to see.
</p>
<p>
In the general elections of 1910, indeed, the two
Conservative candidates, Stanley Bessemere, East, and
Mr. Glynde, West, romped home.  The Colonel was neither
surprised nor deceived by the results of the elections.  He
knew now that in modern England in the towns at all events,
among the rising generation, there were few Conservative
working men—though there were millions who might and
in fact did vote for Conservative candidates; and not many
Radicals—apart from a leaven of sturdy middle-aged
survivors of the Gladstonian age.  The workers as a whole,
it was clear, as they grew in class-consciousness, were
swinging slow as a huge tide, and almost as unconscious,
towards the left.  But they were not articulate; they were
not consistent; they changed their labels as they changed
their clothes, and as yet they steadfastly refused to call
themselves Socialists.  Indeed, in spite of the local
Conservative victory, the outstanding political feature of the
moment, apart from the always growing insurgency of
Woman, was the advance of Labour, as the Colonel and many
other thoughtful observers noted.  He began, moreover,
to see that behind the froth, the foam, and arrant nonsense
of the extreme section of the movement, there was gathering
a solid body of political philosophy.  The masses were
becoming organised—an army, no longer a rabble; with
staff, regimental officers, plan of campaign, and an always
growing discipline.  And, whether you agreed with it or
not, there was no denying that the Minority Report of the
Poor Law Commission was a political portent.
</p>
<p>
When Joe Burt came up to Undercliff, as he sometimes
did, to smoke and chat with the Colonel, Mrs. Lewknor, a
whole-hearted Tory, would attack him on the tyranny of
Trade Unions with magnificent fury.
</p>
<p>
She made no impression on the engineer, stubborn as
herself.
</p>
<p>
"War is war; and discipline is discipline.  And in war
it's the best disciplined Army that wins.  A should have
thought a soldier'd have realised that much.  And this
isna one o your <i>little</i> wars, mind ye!  This is the Greatest
War that ever was or will be.  And we workers are fighting
for our lives."
</p>
<p>
"Discipline is one thing and tyranny is quite another!"
cried Mrs. Lewknor, with flashing eyes.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, who delighted in these pitched battles,
sat and sucked his pipe on the fringe of the hub-bub; only
now and then turning the cooling hose of his irony on the
combatants.
</p>
<p>
"It is," he said in his detached way.  "Discipline is
pressure you exert on somebody else.  And tyranny is
pressure exerted by somebody else upon you."
</p>
<p>
And it was well he was present to introduce the leaven
of humour into the dough of controversy, for Mrs. Lewknor
found the engineer a maddening opponent.  He was so
cool, so logical, and above all so <i>dam</i> provocative, as the
little lady remarked with a snap of her still perfect teeth.
He gave no quarter and asked none.
</p>
<p>
"I don't like him," she said with immense firmness to
the Colonel after one of these encounters, standing in
characteristic attitude, her skirt a little lifted, and one foot
daintily poised on the fender-rail.  "I don't trust him one
inch."
</p>
<p>
"He is a bit mad-doggy," the other said, entwining
his long legs.  "But he is genuine."
</p>
<p>
Then two significant incidents cast the shadow of coming
events on the screen of Time.
</p>
<p>
In July, 1911, Germany sent the <i>Panther</i> to Agadir.
There ensued a sudden first-class political crisis; and a
panic on every Stock Exchange in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Even Ernie was moved.  This man who, in spite of
Joe Burt's teaching, took as yet little more account of
political happenings than does the field-mouse of the
manoeuvres of the reaping machine that will shortly destroy
its home, crossed the golf links one evening and walked
through Meads to find out what the Colonel thought.
</p>
<p>
"What's it going to be, sir?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The other refused to commit himself.
</p>
<p>
"Might be anything," he said.  "Looks a bit funny."
</p>
<p>
"Think the reservists will be called up?"
</p>
<p>
The old soldier evinced a curious restrained keenness
as of a restive horse desiring to charge a fence and yet
uncertain of what it will find on the far side.  The Colonel,
appraising him with the shrewd eyes of the man used to
judging men, was satisfied.
</p>
<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised," was all he would say.
</p>
<p>
The old Hammer-man walked away along the cliff in the
direction of Meads, and dropped down on to the golf links
to go home by the ha-ha outside the Duke's Lodge.  Then he
swung away under the elms of Compton Place Road and
turned into Saffrons Croft, where Ruth and the children
were to have met him.  He looked about for them in vain.
The cricketers were there as always, the idlers strolling from
group to group, but no Ruth.  Ernie who had been looking
forward to a quiet half-hour's play with little Alice and Susie
on the turf in the shade of the elms before bed-time felt
himself thwarted and resentful.  Ruth as a rule was
reliable; but of late, ever since his unkindness to her at
the time of Susie's illness, three weeks since, he had marked
a change in her, subtle perhaps but real.  True she denied
him nothing; but unlike herself, she gave without generosity,
coldly and as a duty.
</p>
<p>
Nursing his grievance, he dropped down the steep hill
under the Manor-house wall, past the Greys, into Church
Street.
</p>
<p>
At the <i>Star</i> a little group was gossiping, heads together.
As he crossed the road they turned and looked at him with
curiosity and in silence.  Then a mate of his in the Transport
Company called across,
</p>
<p>
"Sorry to hear this, Ern."
</p>
<p>
Ernie, thinking the man referred to the probabilities
that he would be called back to the Army, and proud of
his momentary fortuitous importance, shouted back with
an air of appropriate nonchalance,
</p>
<p>
"That's all right, Guy.  I wouldn't mind a spell with the
old regiment again—that I wouldn't."
</p>
<p>
At the foot of Borough Lane he met Alf bustling along.
His brother did not pause, but gave Ernie a searching
look as he passed and said, "Watch it, Ern!"
</p>
<p>
Ern experienced a strange qualm as he approached his
home.  The door was open; nobody was about; there
was not a sound in the house—neither the accustomed
chirp of the children, nor the voice and movements of
their mother.
</p>
<p>
The nightmare terrors that are wont to seize the sensitive
at such times, especially if their conscience is haunted,
laid hold of him.  The emptiness, the silence appalled him.
Death, so it seemed to his imaginative mind, reigned where
the life and warmth and pleasant human busyness the
woman and her children create had formerly been.  Ever
since that dark moment when he had let loose those foul
and treacherous words, he had been uneasy in his mind;
and yet, though usually the humblest of men, some stubborn
imp of pride had possessed him and refused to allow him
to express the contrition he genuinely felt.  Perhaps the
very magnitude of his offence had prevented him from
making just amends.
</p>
<p>
Ruth on her side had said nothing; but she had felt
profoundly the wound he had inflicted on her heart.  So
much her silence and unusual reserve had told him.  Had
he gone too far?  Had her resentment been deeper than
he had divined?  Had he by his stupid brutality in a
moment of animal panic and animal pain snapped the light
chain that bound him to this woman he loved so dearly and
knew so little?  And none was more conscious than he how
fragile was that chain.  Ruth had never been immersed in
love for him: she had never pretended to be.  He knew
that.  She had been an affectionate and most loyal friend;
and that was all.
</p>
<p>
On the threshold of his home he paused and stared
down with the frightened snort of a horse suddenly aware
of an abyss gaping at his feet.
</p>
<p>
For the first time in his married life the instant sense
of his insecurity, always present in his subconsciousness,
leapt into the light of day.
</p>
<p>
He gathered himself and marched upstairs as a man
marches up the steps of the scaffold to pay the merited
punishment for his crimes.
</p>
<p>
Then he heard a little noise.  The door of the back room
where the children, all but the baby, slept, was open.  He
peeped in.  Susie was there, and Jenny with her.  Hope
returned to him.  They were sitting up in bed still in
outdoor clothes.  Then he noticed that the baby's cot
which stood of wont in the front room beside the big bed
was here too.  His sudden relief changed to anguish.  He
saw it all: <i>his</i> children, the three of them, packed away
together like fledgelings in a nest—for him to mother; and
the mother-bird herself and <i>her</i> child flown!
</p>
<p>
And he had brought his punishment on to his own head!
</p>
<p>
Susie waved a rag-doll at him and giggled.
</p>
<p>
"Neddy seeps with Susie!" she cried.  "Susie nurse
him!  Mummy's gone with man!"
</p>
<p>
Brutally Ernie burst into the bedroom.
</p>
<p>
Two people stood beside the bed—his wife and a man;
one on either side of it.
</p>
<p>
The man was Joe Burt; the woman Ruth.
</p>
<p>
On the bed between them lay little Alice, wan as a lily,
her eyes closed apparently in death.
</p>
<p>
As he entered Joe raised a hushing finger.
</p>
<p>
"It's all right, Ern.  She isna dead," said the engineer,
comfortably.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, who was the colour of the child on the bed, had
turned to him and now wreathed her arms about him.
</p>
<p>
"O Ern!" she cried in choking voice.  "I <i>am</i> that glad
you've come."
</p>
<p>
For a moment she hung on him, dependent as he had
never known her.
</p>
<p>
Then the child stirred, opened her eyes, saw Ernie at the
foot of the bed, and smiled.
</p>
<p>
"Daddy," came her sweet little voice.
</p>
<p>
Her eyes fell on Joe; her lovely brow crumpled and she
wailed,
</p>
<p>
"Don't want man."
</p>
<p>
"That's me," said Joe gently, and stole towards the
door on tip-toe.  Ern followed him out.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp met them on the stairs.
</p>
<p>
At the outer door Joe gave a whispered account of what
had happened.  He had been crossing Saffrons Croft on the
way up to see Ernie, when he had noticed Ruth and the
children under the elms.  Little Alice had seen him and come
rushing through the players towards her friend.  A cricket-ball
had struck her on the forehead; and he had carried
her home like a dead thing.  Outside the cottage they had
met Alf, and Ruth had asked him to go for Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
Ernie ran back upstairs.
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon, bending over the child, gave him a
reassuring glance.
</p>
<p>
"The child's all right," he said.  "See to the mother!"
and nodded to Ruth, who was holding on to the mantel-piece.
</p>
<p>
She was swaying.  Ern gathered her to him.  The
whole of her weight seemed on him.  His eyes hung on her
face, pale beneath its dark crown as once, and only once,
he had seen it before—that time she lay on the bed in Royal's
dressing-room on the dawn of her undoing.
</p>
<p>
"Ruth," he called quietly.
</p>
<p>
Slowly she returned to life, opening her eyes, and drawing
her hand across them.
</p>
<p>
"Is that you, Ern?" she sighed.  "O, that's right.  I
come all over funny like.  Silly!  I'm all right now."
</p>
<p>
Ernie lowered her into a chair.
</p>
<p>
She sat a moment, gathering herself.  Then she looked
up at him—and remembered.  She had been caught.  Fear
came over her, and she began to tremble.
</p>
<p>
He bent and kissed her.
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry I said that, Ruth," he whispered in her ear.
</p>
<p>
A lovely light welled up into her eyes.  At that moment
she was nearer loving him than she had ever been.  Regardless
of Mr. Trupp's presence, she put a hand on either of
his shoulders, and regarded him steadfastly, a baffling look
on her face.
</p>
<p>
"Dear Ern!" she said.  "Only I'd liefer you didn't
say it again.  See, it <i>do</i> hurt from you."
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
SHADOWS
</h3>
<p>
Ern was not called up after all.
</p>
<p>
The trap-door through which men had peered aghast
into the fires of hell, closed suddenly as it had opened.
Only the clang of the stokers working in the darkness under
the earth could still be heard day and night at their infernal
busyness by any who paused and laid ear to the ground.
</p>
<p>
England and the world breathed again.
</p>
<p>
"Touch and go," said Mr. Trupp, who felt like a man
coming to the surface after a deep plunge.
</p>
<p>
"Dress rehearsal," said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"It'll never be so near again!" Mr. Pigott announced
pontifically to his wife.  "Never!"
</p>
<p>
"Thank you," replied that lady.  "May we take it
from you?"
</p>
<p>
When it was over the Colonel found that the walls of
Jericho had fallen: the Liberal Citadel had been stormed.
Mr. Geddes took the chair at a meeting at St. Andrew's
Hall to discuss the programme of the League.
</p>
<p>
"It looks as if you were right after all," the tall minister
said to the Colonel gravely.
</p>
<p>
"Pray heaven I'm not," the other answered in like tones.
</p>
<p>
The second significant incident of this time, which
occurred during a lull before the final flare-up of the
long-drawn Agadir crisis, had less happy results from the point
of view of the old soldier.
</p>
<p>
In August, suddenly and without warning, the railway-men
came out.  The Colonel had been up to London for
the night on the business of the League, and next morning
had walked into Victoria Street Station to find it in
possession of the soldiers: men in khaki in full marching
order, rifle, bayonet, and bandolier; sentries everywhere;
and on the platform a Union official in a blue badge urging
the guard to come out.
</p>
<p>
The guard, a heavy-shouldered middle-aged fellow, was
stubbornly lumping along the platform on flat feet, swinging
his lantern.
</p>
<p>
"I've got a heart," he kept on reiterating.  "I've got
a wife and children to think of."
</p>
<p>
"So've I," replied the official, dogging him.  "It's
because I am thinking of them that I'm out."
</p>
<p>
"Silly 'aound!" said a bystander
</p>
<p>
"No, he ain't then!" retorted a second.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, he is!" chipped in a third.  "Makin trouble
for isself and everybody else all round.  Calls isself the
workers' friend!—Hadgitator, I call him!"
</p>
<p>
All the way down to Beachbourne in the train the Colonel
marked pickets guarding bridges; a cavalry patrol with
lances flashing from the green covert of a country lane;
a battery on the march; armies on the move.
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt's right, he reflected, it's war.
</p>
<p>
"I never thought to see the like of that in England,"
said a fellow-traveller, eyes glued to the window.
</p>
<p>
"Makes you think," the Colonel admitted.
</p>
<p>
Arrived home he found there was a call for special
constables.  That evening he went to the police station
to sign on, and found many of the leading citizens of
Beachbourne there on like errand.  Bobby Chislehurst, his open
young face clouded for once, and disturbed, was pressing
the point of view of the railway-men on Stanley Bessemere,
who was listening with the amused indifference of the man
who knows.
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid there is no doubt about it," the politician
was saying, shaking the sagacious head of the embryo
statesmen.  "They're taking advantage of the international
situation to try to better themselves."
</p>
<p>
"But they say it's the Government and the directors
who are taking advantage of it to try and put them off—as
they've been doing for years!" cried Bobby, finely indignant.
</p>
<p>
"I believe I know what I am talking about," replied
the other, unmoved from the rock of his superiority.  "I
don't mind telling you that the European situation is still
most precarious.  The men know that, and they're trying
to squeeze the Government.  I should like to think it
wasn't so."
</p>
<p>
Then the Archdeacon's voice loudly uplifted overwhelmed
all others.
</p>
<p>
"O, for an hour of the Kaiser!—He'd deal with em.
The one man left in Europe—now my poor Emperah's
gone.  Lloyd George ... Bowing the knee to Baal
... Traitors to their country ... Want a lesson
... What can you expect?"  He mouthed away
grandiloquently in detached sentences to the air in
general; and nobody paid any attention to him.
</p>
<p>
Near by, Mr. Pigott, red and ruffled, was asking what
the Army had to do with it?—who wanted the soldiers?—why
not leave it to the civilians?—with a provocative
glance at the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
Then there was a noise of marching in the street, and a
body of working-men drew up outside the door.
</p>
<p>
"Who are those fellows?" asked the Archdeacon loudly.
</p>
<p>
"Workers from the East-end, old cock," shouted one of
them as offensively through the door.  "Come to sign
on as Specials!  And just as good a right here as you
have...."
</p>
<p>
The leader of the men in the street broke away from them
and shouldered into the yard, battle in his eye.
</p>
<p>
It was Joe Burt, who, as the Colonel had once remarked,
was sometimes a wise statesman, and sometimes a foaming
demagogue.  To-day he was the latter at his worst.
</p>
<p>
"What did I tell yo?" he said to the Colonel roughly.
"Bringin oop the Army against us.  Royal Engineers
driving trains and all!  It's a disgrace."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel reasoned with him.
</p>
<p>
"But, my dear fellow, you can't have one section of
the community holding up the country."
</p>
<p>
"Can't have it!" surly and savage.  "Yo've had five
hundred dud plutocrats in the House of Lords holding up
the people for years past.  Did ye shout then?  If they
use direct action in their own interests why make a
rout when 500,000 railway men come out for a living
wage?—And <i>then</i> you coom to the workers and ask
them to strengthen the Army the Government'll use
against them!—A wonder yo've the face!"  He turned
away, shaking.
</p>
<p>
Just then happily there was a diversion.  The yard-door,
which a policeman had shut, burst open; and a baggy
old gentleman lumbered through it with the scared look of
a bear lost in a busy thoroughfare and much the motions
of one.
</p>
<p>
Holding on to his coat-tails like a keeper came Ruth.
She was panting, and a little dishevelled; in her arms was
her baby, and her hat was a-wry.
</p>
<p>
"He would come!" she said, almost in tears.  "There
was no stoppin him.  So I had just to come along too."
</p>
<p>
Joe, aware that he had gone too far, and glad of the
interruption, stepped up to Ruth and took the baby from
her arms.  The distressed woman gave him a look of
gratitude and began to pat and preen her hair.
</p>
<p>
At this moment Ernie burst into the yard.  He was more
alert than usual, and threw a swift, almost hostile, glance
about him.  Then he saw Ruth busy tidying herself, and
relaxed.
</p>
<p>
"Caught him playing truant, didn't you, in Saffrons
Croft?" he said.  "The park-keeper tell me."
</p>
<p>
Ruth was recovering rapidly.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," she laughed.  "I told him it was nothing to
do with him—strikes and riots and bloodshed!—Such an
idea!"
</p>
<p>
A baby began to wail; and Ernie turned to see Joe
with little Ned in his arms.
</p>
<p>
"Hallo!  Joe!" he chaffed.  "<i>My</i> baby, I think."
</p>
<p>
He took his own child amid laughter, Joe surrendering
it reluctantly.
</p>
<p>
Just then Edward Caspar appeared in the door of the
office.  He looked at them over his spectacles and said
quietly, as if to himself.
</p>
<p>
"It's Law as well.  We must never forget that."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned to Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"What's he mean?" he asked low.—"Law as well."
</p>
<p>
Ernie, dandling the baby, drew away into a corner
where he would be out of earshot of the Archdeacon.
</p>
<p>
"It's a line of poetry, sir," he explained in hushed
voice—
</p>
<p class="poem">
  "<i>O, Love that art remorseless Law,<br>
  So beautiful, so terrible.</i>"<br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
"Go on!" said the Colonel, keenly.  "Go on!—I
like that."
</p>
<p>
But Ernie only wagged a sheepish head.
</p>
<p>
"That's all," he said reluctantly.  "It never got
beyond them two lines."  He added with a shy
twinkle—"That's dad, that is."
</p>
<p>
A chocolate-bodied car stopped in the street opposite.
</p>
<p>
Out of it stepped Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
In it the Colonel saw a lean woman with eyes the blue
of steel, fierce black brows, and snow-white hair.
</p>
<p>
She was peering hungrily out.
</p>
<p>
"It's mother come after dad," Ernie explained.  "In
Mr. Trupp's car.  That's my brother driving."
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon, crossing the yard, now met the run-agate
emerging from the office and took him kindly by the arm.
</p>
<p>
"No, no, Mr. Caspar," he scolded soothingly.  "They
don't want old fellows like you and me to do the bludgeon
business.  Our sons'll do all that's necessary in that line."
</p>
<p>
He packed the elderly truant away in the car.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Caspar sat beside his wife, his hands folded on the
handle of his umbrella, looking as determined as he knew
how.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Caspar tucked a rug about his knees.
</p>
<p>
Ernie, who had followed his father out to the car, and
exchanged a word with his brother sitting stiff as an idol,
behind his wheel, now returned to the yard, grinning.
</p>
<p>
"Well!" said Joe.
</p>
<p>
Ernie rolled his head.
</p>
<p>
"Asked Alf if <i>he</i> was goin to sign on?" he grinned.
</p>
<p>
"Is he?" asked the Colonel ingenuously.
</p>
<p>
Ernie laughed harshly.
</p>
<p>
"Not Alf!" he said.  "He's a true Christian, Alf is,
when there's scrapping on the tape..."
</p>
<p>
At the club a few days later, when the trouble had blown
over, the Colonel asked Mr. Trupp if Ernie was ill.
</p>
<p>
"He seemed so slack," he said, with a genuine concern.
</p>
<p>
"So he is," growled the old surgeon.  "He wants the
Lash—that's all."
</p>
<p>
"Different from his brother," mused the Colonel—"that
chauffeur feller of yours.  He's keen enough from what
I can see."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp puffed at his cigar.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's ambitious," he said.  "That's his spur.  Starting
in a big way on his own now.  Sussex is going to blossom
out into Caspar's Garages, he tells me.  I'm going to put
money in the company.  Some men draw money.  Alf's one."
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE LANDLORD
</h3>
<p>
Alf's great scheme indeed was prospering.
</p>
<p>
Thwarted by the Woman, and driven back upon himself,
he had taken up the career of action at the point where he
had left it to pursue an adventure that had brought him
no profit and incredible bitterness.
</p>
<p>
Fortune had favoured him.
</p>
<p>
Just at the moment Ruth had baffled him, another
enemy of his, the Red Cross Garage Syndicate, which in
the early days of his career had throttled him, came to
grief.
</p>
<p>
Alf saw his chance, and flung himself into the new
project with such characteristic energy as to drown the
bitterness of sex-defeat.  He had no difficulty in raising
the necessary capital for the little Syndicate he proposed
to start.  Some he possessed himself; his bank was quite
prepared to give him accommodation up to a point; and there
was a third source he tapped with glee.  That source was
Captain Royal.  Alf was in a position to squeeze the
Captain; and he was not the man to forego an advantage,
however acquired.
</p>
<p>
Royal put a fifth of his patrimony into the venture,
and was by no means displeased to do so.  Thereby he
became the principal shareholder in the concern, with a
predominant voice in its affairs.  That gave him the
leverage against Alf, which, with the instinct of a commander,
he had seen to be necessary for the security of his future
directly that young man showed a blackmailing tendency.
Moreover Royal was not blind to the consideration that
the new Syndicate, under able management, bid fair to be a
singularly profitable investment.
</p>
<p>
Backed then by Royal and his bank, Alf bought up
certain of the garages of the defaulting company at
knockout prices.  Thereafter, if he still coveted Ruth, he was
far too occupied to worry her; while she on her side, purged
by the busyness and natural intercourse of married life
of all the disabling morbidities that had their roots in a
sense of outlawry and the forced restraint put upon a
roused and powerful temperament, had completely lost her
fear of him.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, surely, was changing rapidly now.  At times in
family life she assumed the reins not because she wished
to, but because she must; and on occasion she even took
the whip from the socket.
</p>
<p>
Ernie had, indeed, climbed a mountain peak and with
unbelievable effort and tenacity won to the summit, which
was herself.  But then, instead of marching on to the
assault of the peak which always lies beyond, he had sat
down, stupidly content; with the inevitable consequence
that he tended to slither down the mountain-side and lose
all he had gained in growth and character by his hard
achievement.
</p>
<p>
The pair had been married four years now; and Ruth
knew that her house was built on sand.  That comfortable
sense of security which had accompanied the first years of
her married life, affording her incalculable relief after the
hazards which had preceded them, had long passed.
Dangers, less desperate perhaps in the appearance than in
the days of her darkness, but none the less real, were
careering up from the horizon over a murky sea like breakers,
roaring and with wrathful manes, to overwhelm her.  In
particular the threat that haunts through life the
working-woman of all lands and every race beset her
increasingly.  Her man was always skirting now the bottomless
pit of unemployment.  One slip and he might be over
the edge, hurtling heavily down into nothingness, and
dragging with him her and the unconscious babes.
</p>
<p>
The home, always poor, began to manifest the characteristics
of its tenants, as homes will.  When the young man
came for the rent on Monday mornings, Ruth would open
just a crack so that he might not see inside, herself peeping
out of her door, wary as a woodland creature.  Apart from
Joe Burt, whom she did not count, there was indeed only
one visitor whom Ruth now received gladly; and that
was Mr. Edward Caspar, whose blindness she could depend
upon.
</p>
<p>
There had grown up almost from the first a curious
intimacy between the dreamy old gentleman, fastidious,
scholarly, refined, and the young peasant woman whom
destiny had made the mother of his grandchildren.  Nothing
stood between them, not even the barrier of class.  They
understood each other as do the children of Truth, even
though the language they speak is not the same.
</p>
<p>
The old man was particularly devoted to little Alice.
</p>
<p>
"She's like a water-sprite," he said,—"so fine and
delicate."
</p>
<p>
"She's different from Ernie's," answered Ruth simply.
"I reck'n it was the suffering when I was carrying her."
</p>
<p>
"She's a Botticelli," mused the old man.  "The others
are Michael Angelos."
</p>
<p>
Ruth had no notion what he meant—that often
happened; but she knew he meant something kind.
</p>
<p>
"I'd ha said Sue was more the bottled cherry kind,
myself," she answered gently.
</p>
<p>
Her visitor came regularly every Tuesday morning on
the way to the Quaker meeting-house, shuffling down
Borough Lane past the <i>Star</i>, his coat-tails floating behind
him, his gold spectacles on his nose, with something of the
absorbed and humming laziness of a great bee.  Ruth would
hear the familiar knock at the door and open.  The old
man would sit in the kitchen for an hour by the latest baby's
cot, saying nothing, the child playing with his little finger
or listening to the ticking of the gold watch held to its ear.
</p>
<p>
After he was gone Ruth would always find a new shilling
on the dresser.  When she first told Ernie about the
shilling, he was surly and ashamed.
</p>
<p>
"It's his tobacco money," he said gruffly.  "You mustn't
keep it."
</p>
<p>
Next Tuesday she dutifully handed the coin back to the
giver,
</p>
<p>
"I don't like to take it, sir," she said.
</p>
<p>
The old man was the grandfather of her children, but she
gave him always, and quite naturally, the title of respect.
</p>
<p>
He took it from her and laid it back on the dresser with
the other he had brought.  Then he put his hand on her
arm, and looked at her affectionately through dim spectacles.
</p>
<p>
"You go to the other extreme," he said.  "<i>You're</i>
too kind."
</p>
<p>
After that she kept the money and she was glad of it
too, for she was falling behind with her rent now.
</p>
<p>
Then one Monday morning, the rent-collector making
his weekly call, little brown book in hand, gave her a shock.
</p>
<p>
He was a sprightly youth, cocky and curly, known
among his intimates as Chirpy; and with a jealously
cherished reputation for a way with the ladies.
</p>
<p>
"Say, this is my last visit," he announced sentimentally,
as he made his entry in the book, and poised his pencil
behind his ear.  "We can't part like this, can we?—you
and me, after all these years.  Too cold like."  He drew
the back of his hand significantly across his mouth.
</p>
<p>
Ruth brushed his impertinence aside with the friendly
insouciance which endeared her to young men.
</p>
<p>
"Got the sack for sauce, then?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Chirpy shook his head ruefully.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Goldmann's sold the house."
</p>
<p>
"Over our heads!" cried Ruth, aghast.
</p>
<p>
She hated change, for change spelt the unknown, which
in its turn meant danger.
</p>
<p>
"Seems so," the youth replied.  "No fault o mine, I
do assure you."  He returned to his point.  "Anythink
for Albert?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth was thoroughly alarmed.  Even in those days
cottages in Old Town were hard to come by.
</p>
<p>
"Who's our new landlord?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Caspar, I heard say in the office."
</p>
<p>
Ruth felt instant relief.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Edward Caspar?—O, <i>that's</i> all right."
</p>
<p>
"No; Alf—of the Garridges.  Him they call All-for-isself
Alfie!"
</p>
<p>
Ruth caught her breath.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you," she said, and closed the door swiftly.
</p>
<p>
The youth was left titupping on the door-step, his nose
against the panel like a seeking spaniel.
</p>
<p>
Within, Ruth put her hand to her heart to stay its tumult.
She was thankful Ernie was not there to witness her
emotion, for she felt like a rabbit in the burrow, the stoat
hard on its heels.  All her old terrors revived....
</p>
<p>
The new landlord soon paid his first visit, and Ruth was
ready for him.
</p>
<p>
"You want to see round?" she asked, with the almost
aggressive briskness of the woman who feels herself
threatened.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, as your landlord I got the right of entry."  He
made the announcement portentously like an emperor
dictating terms to a conquered people.
</p>
<p>
Ruth showed him dutifully round.  He paid no attention
to his property: his eyes were all for her; she did not
look at him.
</p>
<p>
Then they went upstairs where it was dark.
</p>
<p>
There was a closed door on the left.  Alf thrust it open
without asking leave; but Ruth barred his passage with
an arm across the door.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" he asked, prying.
</p>
<p>
"Our room.  You can't go in there.  That's where
my children was born."
</p>
<p>
Alf tilted his chin at her knowingly.
</p>
<p>
"All but little Alice," he reminded her.  His eyes
glittered in the dark.  "Does <i>he</i> stand you anything for
her?" he continued confidentially.  "Should do—a
gentleman.  Now if you could get an affiliation order
against him that'd be worth five or six bob a week
to you.  And that's money to a woman in your position—pay
me my rent and all too.  Only pity is," he ended,
thoughtfully, "can't be done.  You and me know that if
Ern don't."
</p>
<p>
Ruth broke fiercely away.
</p>
<p>
Leisurely he followed her down the stairs with loud
feet.  He was greatly at his ease.  His hat, which he had
never taken off, was on the back of his big head.  He was
sucking a dirty pencil, and studying his rent-book, as he
entered the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
"You're a bit behind, I see," casually.
</p>
<p>
"Only two weeks," as coldly.
</p>
<p>
"As yet."
</p>
<p>
He swaggered to the door with a peculiar roll of his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
"If you was to wish to wipe it off at any time you've
only got to say the word.  I might oblige."
</p>
<p>
He stood with his back to her, looking out of the door,
and humming.
</p>
<p>
She was over against the range.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" she panted.
</p>
<p>
Standing on the threshold he turned and leered back
at her out of half-closed eyes.
</p>
<p>
She sneered magnificently.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, I knaw you," she said.
</p>
<p>
"What's it all about?" he answered, cleaning his nails.
"Only a little bit of accommodation.  No thin out o the
way."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you.  I knaw your accommodation," she
answered deeply.
</p>
<p>
"Well," he retorted, picking his teeth.  "There's no
harm in it.  What's the fuss about?"
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell Mr. Trupp," Ruth answered.  "That's all."
</p>
<p>
Alf turned full face to her, jeering.
</p>
<p>
"What's old Trupp to me, then?" he cried.  "I done
with him.  I done with em all.  I'm me own master, I
am—Alfred Caspar, Hesquire, of Caspar's Garridges,
Company promoter.  Handlin me thousands as you handle
coppers."
</p>
<p>
He folded his arms, thrust out a leg, and looked the part
majestically without a snigger.  It was clear he was
extraordinarily impressive to himself.
</p>
<p>
Ruth relaxed slowly, deliciously, like an ice-pack touched
by the laughing kiss of spring.
</p>
<p>
She eyed her enemy with the amused indifference of some
big-boned thoroughbred mare courted by an amorous pony.
</p>
<p>
"You're mad," she said.  "That's the only why I
don't slosh the sauce-pan over you.  But I shall tell Ern
all the same.  And he'll tell em all."
</p>
<p>
"And who's goin to believe Ern?" jeered her tormentor.
"'Old Town Toper,' they call him.  Fairly sodden."
</p>
<p>
"Not to say Archdeacon Willcocks and Mr. Chislehurst,"
continued Ruth, calmly.
</p>
<p>
Alf shot his finger at her like a crook in a melodrama,
looking along it as it might have been a pistol and loving
his pose.
</p>
<p>
"And would they believe <i>you</i> against me?  Do you
attend mass?  Are you a sidesman?"
</p>
<p>
"I was confirmed Church afore ever you was," retorted
Ruth with spirit.  "I've as good a right to the sacraments,
as you have then.  And I'll take to em again if I'm druv
to it—that I will!"
</p>
<p>
Something about this declaration tickled Alf.  The
emperor was forgotten in the naughty urchin.
</p>
<p>
"So long, then!" he tittered.  "Appy au-revoir!
Thank-ye for a pleasant chat.  This day week you can
look forward to.  I'll collect me rent meself because I know
you'd like me to."
</p>
<p>
He turned, and as he was going out ran into a man
who was entering.
</p>
<p>
"Now then!" said a surly voice.  "Who are you?
O, it's <i>you</i>, is it?—I know all about you."
</p>
<p>
"What you know o me?" asked Alf, aggressively.
</p>
<p>
"Why, what a beauty you are."
</p>
<p>
The two men eyed each other truculently.  Then Joe
barged through the door.  The entrance cleared, Alf went
out, but as he passed on the pavement outside he beat a
rat-tan on the window with insolent knuckles.
</p>
<p>
Joe leaped back to the door and scowled down the road
at the back of the little chauffeur retreating at the trot.
Alf excelled physically in only one activity: he could run.
</p>
<p>
The engineer returned to the kitchen, savage and
smouldering.  Ruth, amused at the encounter, met him
with kind eyes.  There was in this man the quality of the
ferocious male she loved.  He marched up to her, his head
low between his shoulders like a bull about to charge.
</p>
<p>
"Is yon lil snot after you?" he growled, almost
menacing.
</p>
<p>
She regarded him with astonishment, amused and yet
defensive.
</p>
<p>
"<i>You're</i> not my husband, Mr. Burt," she cried.
"<i>You've</i> no grievance whoever has."
</p>
<p>
The engineer retreated heavily.
</p>
<p>
"Hapen not," he answered, surly and with averted eyes.
"A coom next though."
</p>
<p>
She looked up, saw his face, and trembled faintly.
</p>
<p>
He prowled to the door without a word, without a look.
</p>
<p>
"Won't you stop for Ern?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Nay," he said, and went out.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE GRANDMOTHER
</h3>
<p>
Ruth and her mother-in-law frequently met in the steep and
curling streets of Old Town as they went about their
business.  They knew and tacitly ignored each other.  But
Ernie's children were not to be ignored.  They knocked
eternally at their granny's heart.  When of summer
evenings their mother took her little brood to Saffrons
Croft and sat with them beneath the elms, her latest baby
in her arms, the others clouding her feet like giant daisies,
Anne Caspar, limping by on flat feet with her string bag,
would be wrung to the soul.
</p>
<p>
She hungered for her grand-children, longed to feel their
limbs, and see their bodies, to hold them in her lap, to bathe
them, win their smiles, and hear their prattle.
</p>
<p>
Pride, which she mistook for principle, stood between
her and happiness.
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew all that was passing in the elder woman's
heart, and felt for the other a profound and disturbing
sympathy.  She had the best of it; and she knew that
Anne Caspar, for all her pharisaic air of superiority, knew
it too.  Ruth had learnt from Mrs. Trupp something of the
elder woman's story.  Anne Caspar too, it seemed, had
loved out of her sphere; but she, unlike Ruth, had achieved
her man.  Had she been happy?  That depended on
whether she had brought happiness to her husband—Ruth
never doubted that.  And Ruth knew that she had not;
and knew that Anne Caspar knew that she had not.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, all that Ernie told her about his mother
interested her curiously: the elder woman's pride, her
loneliness, her passion for her old man.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's mother over again," Ern told Ruth, "with all her
qualities only one—but it's the one that matters.  He's a
worker same as she is.  He means to get on, same as she
done.  There's just this difference atween em: Alf can't
love; Mother can—though it's only one." ...
</p>
<p>
A week after his first visit Alf appeared again on Ruth's
door-step.
</p>
<p>
Ruth opened to him with so bright a smile that he was for
once taken completely by surprise.  He had expected
resistance and come armed to meet it.
</p>
<p>
"Come in, won't you?" she said.
</p>
<p>
Then he understood.  She had thought better of her
foolishness.
</p>
<p>
"That's it, is it?" he said, licking his lips.  "That's
a good gurl."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Ruth.  "Very pleased to see you, I'm sure."  She
was smarter than usual too, he noticed—to grace the
occasion no doubt.  And the plain brown dress, the hue of
autumn leaves, with the tiny white frill at the collar,
revealed the noble lines of her still youthful figure.
</p>
<p>
The conqueror, breathing hard, entered the kitchen, to
be greeted by a cultivated voice from the corner.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Alfred," it said.
</p>
<p>
Alf, whose eyes had been on the floor, glanced up with a
start.
</p>
<p>
His father was sitting beside the cradle, beaming mildly
on him through gold spectacles.
</p>
<p>
"Hullo, dad," said Alf, surlily.  This large ineffectual
father of his had from childhood awed him.  There was a
mystery about even his mildness, his inefficiency, which Alf
had never understood and therefore feared.  "I didn't
expect to find you here."
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Alf that the bottle-imp was twinkling in the
old man's eyes.  Alf remembered well the advent of that imp
to the blue haunts he had never quitted since.  That was
during the years of Ern's absence in India.  Now it struck
him suddenly that his father, so seeming-innocent, so remote
from the world, was in the joke against him.
</p>
<p>
A glance at Ruth, malicious and amused, confirmed his
suspicion.
</p>
<p>
"I'm glad you come and visit your sister sometimes,
Alfred," said the old man gently.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," purred Ruth, "he comes reg'lar, Alf do now—once
a week.  And all in the way of friendship as the savin
is.  See, he's our landlord now."
</p>
<p>
"That's nice," continued the old man with the dewy
innocence of a babe.  "Then he can let you off your rent
if you get behind."
</p>
<p>
"So he could," commented Ruth, "if only he was to
think of it.  Do you hear your dad, Alf?"
</p>
<p>
She paid the week's rent into his hand, coin by coin,
before his father's eyes.  Then he turned and slouched out.
</p>
<p>
"Good-night, Alf," Ruth said, almost affectionately.
"It 'as been nice seein you and all."
</p>
<p>
Determined to enjoy her triumph to the full, she
followed him to the door.  In the street he turned to meet
her mocking glance, in which the cruelty gleamed like a
half-sheathed sword.  His own eyes were impudent and familiar
as they engaged hers.
</p>
<p>
"Say, Ruth, what's he after?" he asked, cautiously, in
lowered voice.
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"That feller I caught you with the other night—when
Ern wasn't there.  Black-ugly.  What's he after?"
</p>
<p>
"Same as you, hap."
</p>
<p>
He sniggered feebly.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?"
</p>
<p>
"Me."
</p>
<p>
She stood before him; a peak armoured through the ages
in eternal ice and challenging splendidly in the sun.
</p>
<p>
He hoiked and spat and turned away.
</p>
<p>
"Brassy is it?" he said.  "One thing, my lass, you been
in trouble once, mind.  I saved you then.  But I mightn't
be able to a second time."
</p>
<p>
Behind Ruth's shoulder a dim face, bearded and
spectacled, peered at him with the mild remorselessness of
the moon.
</p>
<p>
"Alfred," said a voice, dreadful in its gentle austerity.
</p>
<p>
When the old man said good-bye to Ruth ten minutes
later he kissed her for the first time.
</p>
<p>
She smiled up at him gallantly.
</p>
<p>
"It's all right, dad," she said, consolingly.  "I'm not
afraid o <i>him</i> whatever else."
</p>
<p>
It was the first time she had called him dad, and even now
she did it unconsciously.
</p>
<p>
Edward Caspar ambled home.
</p>
<p>
He did not attempt to conceal from his wife where he
went on Tuesday mornings.  Indeed, as he soared on
mysterious wings, he seemed to have lost all fear of the
woman who had tyrannised over him for his own good so
long.  Time, the unfailing arbitrator, had adjusted the
balance between the two.  And sometimes it seemed to
Mrs. Trupp, observing quietly as she had done for thirty
years, that in the continuous unconscious struggle that
persists inevitably between every pair from the first mating
till death, the victory in this case would be to the man
intangible as air.
</p>
<p>
That morning, as Edward entered the house, his wife
was standing in the kitchen before the range.
</p>
<p>
Anne Caspar was white-haired now.  Her limbs had
lost much of their comeliness, her motions their grace.  She
was sharp-boned and gaunt of body as she had always been
of mind—not unlike a rusty sword.
</p>
<p>
As the front-door opened, and the well-trained man
sedulously wiped his boots upon the mat, she looked up
over her spectacles, dropping her chin, grim and sardonic.
</p>
<p>
"I know where you been, dad," she taunted.
</p>
<p>
He stayed at the study-door, like a great pawing bear.
</p>
<p>
Then he answered suddenly and with a smile.
</p>
<p>
"I've been in heaven."
</p>
<p>
She slammed the door of the range; smiling, cruel, the
school-girl who teases.
</p>
<p>
"I know where your tobacco money goes, old dad," she
continued.
</p>
<p>
His mind was far too big and vague and mooning often
to be able to encounter successfully the darts his wife
occasionally shot into his large carcase.
</p>
<p>
"He's a beautiful boy," was all he now made answer, as
he disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Whether the wound he dealt was deliberately given in
self-defence, or unconsciously because he had the power
over her, his words stung Anne Caspar to the quick.
</p>
<p>
She turned white, and sat down in the lonely kitchen her
wrung old hands twisted in her lap, hugging her wound.
</p>
<p>
Then she recovered enough to take reprisals.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's their landlord, now," she cried after him, the
snakes in her eyes darting dreadful laughter.
</p>
<p>
Edward Caspar turned in the door.
</p>
<p>
"Anne," he said, "I wish you to pay Ruth's rent in
future out of the money my father left you."
</p>
<p>
The voice was mild but there was a note of authority,
firm if faint, running through it.
</p>
<p>
Anne rose grimly to her feet, thin as a stiletto, and
almost as formidable.
</p>
<p>
"That woman!"
</p>
<p>
He nodded at her down the passage.
</p>
<p>
"My daughter."
</p>
<p>
Anne turned full face.
</p>
<p>
"D'you know she's had a love-child?" she shrilled,
discordant as a squeaking wheel.
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman, fumbling at the door of his study,
dropped his bearded chin, and beamed at the angry woman,
moonwise over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
"Why shouldn't she?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
There was something crisp, almost curt, in the
interrogation.
</p>
<p>
"But she's not respectable!"
</p>
<p>
Again he dropped his chin and seemed to gape blankly.
</p>
<p>
"Why should she be?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
She heard the key turn, and knew that she was locked out
for the night.
</p>
<p>
Later she crept in list-slippers to the door and knocked
with the slow and solemn knuckles of fate, a calculated
pause between each knock.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's going up, Ern's going down," she said, nodding
with grim relish.  "<i>Good</i>-night, old dad."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Next evening Joe called at the cottage, to fetch Ernie for
the class.  He arrived as he sometimes had done of late, a
little before Ernie was due home from the yard.  At this
hour the little ones had already been put to bed; and Ruth
would be alone with Alice, between whom and the engineer
there had sprung up a singular intimacy ever since the
evening on which he had carried her home like a dead thing in
his arms from Saffrons Croft.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had not seen him since his clash with Alfred in the
door; and he had obviously avoided her.
</p>
<p>
Now she thrilled faintly.  Was he in love with her?—she
was not sure.
</p>
<p>
He entered without speaking and took his seat as always
before the fire, broad-spread and slightly huddled in his
overcoat, chin on chest, staring into the fire.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, busy baking, her arms up to the elbow in dough,
made her decision swiftly.  She would meet him, face him,
fight him.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Joe," she said, not looking at him.
</p>
<p>
It was the first time she had called him that.
</p>
<p>
He peeped up at her, only his eyes moving, small,
black-brown, and burning like a bear's.
</p>
<p>
"That's better," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
She flashed up at him.  Innocence and cunning, the
schoolboy and the brute, Pan and Silenus fought, leered, and
frolicked in his face.
</p>
<p>
Ruth dropped her gaze and kneaded very deliberately.
</p>
<p>
Yes ... it was so ... Now she would help
him; and she could hold him.  She would transmute his
passion into friendship.  She would bridle her bull, ride him,
tame him.  It was dangerous, and she loved danger.  It
was sport; and she loved sport.  It was an adventure
after the heart of a daring woman.  He was a fine man, too,
and fierce, warrior and orator; worth conquering and
subduing to her will.  His quality of a fighting male called
to her.  She felt the challenge and answered it with singing
blood.
</p>
<p>
That laughing hidalgo who in Elizabethan days had
landed from his galleon in the darks at the Haven to bring
terror and romance to some Sussex maid; that Spaniard
who lurked obscurely in her blood, gave her her swarthy
colouring, her indolent magnificence and surprising quality,
was stirring uneasily within her once again.
</p>
<p>
She lifted her eyes from the froth of yeast and looked
across at him, accepting battle—if he meant battle.  And
he did: there was no doubt of that.  He sat there, hunched,
silent, breathing heavily.  Then little Alice slipped down
from the kitchen table on which she had been sitting at her
mother's side, danced across to her friend, and climbed
up on his knee.  Ruth took her arms out of the bowl,
white to the elbow with flour, came across to the pair,
firm-faced, and deliberately removed the child.
</p>
<p>
Joe rose and went out.  In the outer door he stumbled
on a man half-hidden on the threshold.
</p>
<p>
"That you, Joe?" said Ernie quietly.  "There he is!
Alf—on the spy.  See his head bob—there!  At the bottom
of Borough Lane—It's her he's after."
</p>
<p>
Joe peeped over his friend's shoulder, his bullet head
thrust out like a dog who scents an enemy.
</p>
<p>
"That sort; is he?" he muttered.  "I'll after him!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE CHALLENGE
</h3>
<p>
Joe Burt had that passion for saving souls which is the
hall-mark of the missionary in every age.  Had he been a
child of the previous generation he would have become a
minister in some humble denomination and done his
fighting from the pulpit, Bible in hand, amid the pot-banks
of a Black Country township or the grimy streets of a
struggling mining village in the North.  As it was he
appealed to the mass from the platform, and, a true fisher of
men, flung his net about the individual in the class-room
and at conferences.
</p>
<p>
Always seeking fresh fields to conquer, he had established
a political footing now even in Tory Old Town.  He had
opened a discussion at the Institute, and actually given
an address to the local Church of England's Men's Society
on Robert Owen and early English Socialists; and he owed
his triumph in the main to Bobby Chislehurst.
</p>
<p>
It is not without a pang that we part from the most
cherished of our prejudices, and as Joe launched out into an
always larger life it had come to him as something of a shock
to find amongst the younger clergy some who preserved
an attitude of firm and honest neutrality in the great battle to
which he had pledged his life, and even a few, here and there,
who took their stand on the side of the revolutionaries of the
Spirit.
</p>
<p>
And such a one was Bobby.
</p>
<p>
Because of that, the young curate, who was up and down
all day amid the humble dwellers in the Moot, innocent and
happy as a child, was forgiven his solitary sin.  For Bobby
was a Scout-master, unashamed; and Joe Burt, like most
of his battle-fellows of that date looked askance on the
Boy-Scout Movement as one of the many props of militarist
Toryism none the less effective because it was unavowed.
</p>
<p>
The Cherub, bold, almost blatant in sin, passed his
happiest hours in a rakish sombrero, shorts, and a shirt
bedizened with badges, tramping the Downs at the head
of the Old Town Troop of devoted Boy-Scouts, lighting
forbidden fires in the gorse, arguing with outraged farmers,
camping in secluded coombes above the sea.
</p>
<p>
Up there on the hill, between sky and sea, Joe Burt, he
too with his little flock of acolytes from the East-end, would
sometimes meet the young shepherd on Saturday afternoons,
trudging along, in his hand a pole in place of a crook.
</p>
<p>
"I forgive you Mr. Chislehurst, because I know you don't
know what you're doing," he once said, gravely.  "You're
like the Israelite—without guile."
</p>
<p>
"The greatest of men have their little failings," giggled
the sinner.
</p>
<p>
The two men, besides their political sympathies, had
another point in common: they meant to save Ernie from
himself.  But Joe was no longer single-eyed.  He saw now
in Ernie two men—a potential recruit of value for the cause
of Labour, and the man who possessed the woman he loved.
</p>
<p>
In the troubled heart of the engineer there began to be a
confused conflict between the fisher of men and the covetous
rival.  Ernie was entirely unconscious of the tumult in the
bosom of his friend of which he was the innocent cause.
Not so Ruth.
</p>
<p>
She was rousing slowly now like a hind from her lair in
the bracken, and sniffing the air at the approach of the
antlered stranger.  As he drew always nearer with stops and
starts and dainty tread, and she became increasingly aware
of his savage presence, his fierce intentions, she withdrew
instinctively for protection towards her rightful lord.  He
grazed on the hill-side blind to his danger, blind to hers,
blind to the presence of his enemy.  Ernie's indeed was that
innocence, that simplicity, which rouses in the heart of
primitive woman not respect but pity; and in the rose-bud
of pity, unless it be virgin white, lurks always the canker of
contempt and the worm of cruelty.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes of evenings, as Ernie dozed before the fire in
characteristic negligé, collarless, tie-less, somnolent as the
cat, she watched him with growing resentment, comparing
him to that Other, so much the master of himself and his
little world.
</p>
<p>
"You <i>are</i> slack," she said once, more to herself than him.
</p>
<p>
"I got a right to be, I reck'n, a'ter my day's work," he
answered sleepily.
</p>
<p>
"Joe's not like that," she answered, wetting her thread.
"He's spry, he is.  Doos a long day's work too—and earns
big money, Joe do.  Brings home more'n twice as much
what you do Saraday—and no wife nor children neether."
</p>
<p>
Ernie looked up and blinked.  For a moment she hoped
and feared she had stung him to eruption.  Then he nodded
off again.  That was what annoyed Ruth.  He would not
flare.  He was like his father.  But qualities a woman
admires in an old man she may despise in her lover.  As she
retired upon him she felt him giving way behind her.  She
was seeking support and finding emptiness.
</p>
<p>
And as that Other, shaggy-maned and mighty, stole
towards her with his air of a conqueror, trampling the
heather under-foot, the inadequacy of her own mate forced
itself upon her notice always more.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, now thirty, was in the full bloom of her passionate
womanhood; drawing with her far-flung fragrance the
pollen-bearing bee and drawn to him.  The girl who had
been seized and overthrown by a passing brigand was a
woman now who looked life in the face with steadfast
eyes and meant to have her share of the fruits of it.  The old
Christian doctrines of patience, resignation, abnegation of
the right to a full life, made no appeal to her.  Richly
dowered herself, she would not brook a starved existence.
She who was empty yearned for fulness.  After her catastrophe,
itself the consequence of daring, Ern had come into
her life and given her what she had needed most just then—rest,
security, above all children.  On that score she was
satisfied now; and perhaps for that very reason her spirit
was all the more a-thirst for adventure in other fields.  She
was one of those women who demand everything of life and
are satisfied with nothing less.  Like many such her heart
was full of children but her arms were empty.  For her
fulfilment she needed children and mate.  Some women
were content with one, some with the other.  Great woman
that she was, nothing less than both could satisfy her
demands; and her emptiness irked her increasingly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth's in fact was the problem of the unconquered
woman—a problem at least as common among married
women who have sought absorption and found only
dissatisfaction as amongst the unmarried.  Royal had seized
her imagination for a moment; to Ernie she had submitted.
But that complete immersion in a man and his
work which is for a full woman love, she had never
experienced, and longed to experience.  After five years of
marriage Ernie was still outside her, an accretion, a
circumstance, a part of her environment, necessary perhaps
as her clothes, but little more: for there was no purpose in
his life.
</p>
<p>
And then just at the moment her lack was making
itself most felt, the Man had come—a real man too, with
a work; a pioneer, marching a-head, axe in hand, hewing
a path-way through the Forest, and calling to her with ever
increasing insistency to come out to him and aid him in
his enterprise.
</p>
<p>
But always as she fingered in her dreams the bolts of
the gate that, once opened, would leave her face to face with
the importunate adventurer, there came swarming about
her, unloosing her fingers as they closed upon the bolts,
the children.  And as one or other of them stirred or called
out in sleep in the room above her, she would start, wake,
and shake herself.  Yet even the pull of the children was
not entirely in one direction.  There were four of them
now; and they were growing, while Ernie's wages were
standing still.  That was one of the insistent factors of the
situation.  Were they too to be starved?
</p>
<p>
Often in her dim kitchen she asked herself that question.
For if in her dreams she was always the mate of a man,
she was in fact, and before all things, the mother of children.
Who then was to save them and her?—Ernie? who was
now little more than a shadow, an irritating shadow,
wavering in the background of her life?  If so, God help
them all....
</p>
<p>
One evening she was in the little back-yard taking down
the washing, when she heard a man enter the kitchen.
She paid no heed.  If it was Joe he could wait; if it was
Ernie she needn't bother.  Then she heard a second man
enter, and instantly a male voice, harsh with challenge.
</p>
<p>
She went in hastily.  There was nobody in the kitchen;
but Ern was standing at the outer door.  His back was to
her, but she detected instantly in the hunch of his shoulders
a rare combativeness.
</p>
<p>
"You know me," he was growling to somebody outside.
"None of it now!"
</p>
<p>
He turned slowly, a dark look in his face which did not
lighten when he saw her.
</p>
<p>
"Who was it, Ern?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Alf," he answered curtly.
</p>
<p>
That night as he sat opposite her she observed him warily
as she worked and put to herself an astonishing question:
Was there another Ernie?—an Ernie asleep she had not
succeeded in rousing?  Was the instrument sound and the
fault in her, the player?
</p>
<p>
A chance phrase of Mrs. Trupp's now recurred to her.
</p>
<p>
"There's so much in Ernie—if you can only get it out."
</p>
<p>
The man opposite rose slowly, came slowly to her, bent
slowly and kissed her.
</p>
<p>
"I ask your pardon if I was rough with you this evening,
Ruth," he said.  "But Alf!—he fairly maddens me.  I
feel to him as you shouldn't feel to any human being, let
alone your own brother.  You know what he's after?"
he continued.
</p>
<p>
She stirred and coloured, as she lifted her eyes to his,
dark with an unusual tenderness.
</p>
<p>
"Reckon so, Ern," she said.
</p>
<p>
He stood before the fire, for once almost handsome in
his vehemence.
</p>
<p>
"Layin his smutty hands on you!" he said.
</p>
<p>
That little scene, with its suggestion of passion suppressed,
steadied Ruth....  And it was time.  That Other was
always drawing nearer.  And as she felt his approach, the
savage power of him, his fierce virility, and was conscious
of the reality of the danger, she resolved to meet it and
fend it off.  He should save Ernie instead of destroying her.
And the way was clear.  If this new intellectual life, the seeds
of which the engineer had been sowing so patiently for so
long in the unkempt garden of Ernie's spirit became a reality
for him, a part of himself, growing in such strength as to
strangle the weeds of carelessness, he was saved—so much
Ruth saw.
</p>
<p>
"Once he was set alight to, all his rubbish'd go up in a
flare, and he'd burn bright as aflame," she told the engineer
once seizing her chance; and ended on the soft note of the
turtle-dove—"There's just one could set him ablaze—and
only one.  And that's you, Joe."
</p>
<p>
At the moment Joe was sitting before the fire in
characteristic attitude, hands deep in his pockets, legs
stretched out, the toes of his solid boots in the air.
</p>
<p>
For a moment he did not answer.  It was as though
he had not heard.  Then he turned that slow, bull-like
glare of his full on her.
</p>
<p>
"A'm to save him that he may enjoy you—that's it,
is it?" he said.  "A'm to work ma own ruin."
</p>
<p>
It was the first time he had openly declared himself.
Now that it had come she felt, like many another woman
in such case, a sudden instant revulsion.  Her dreams blew
away like mist at the discharge of cannon.  She was left
with a sense of shock as one who has fallen from a height.
At the moment of impact she was ironing, and glad of it.
Baring her teeth unconsciously she pressed hard down on
the iron with a little hiss.
</p>
<p>
"You've no call to talk to me like that, Joe.  It's not
right."
</p>
<p>
Deliberately he rose and turned his back.
</p>
<p>
"A don't know much," he growled in his chest, "but
A do know that then."
</p>
<p>
Her heart thumped against her ribs.
</p>
<p>
"I thart you were straight, Joe," she said.
</p>
<p>
He warmed his hands at the blaze; and she knew he
was grinning, and the nature of the grin.
</p>
<p>
"A thought so maself till A found A wasn't," he answered.
"No man knows what's in him till he's tried—that's ma
notion of it.  Then he'll have a good few surprises, same as
A've done.  A man's a very funny thing when he's along
of a woman he loves—that's ma experience."
</p>
<p>
Ruth trembled, and her hand swept to and fro with
the graceful motions of a circling eagle over the child's
frock she was ironing.
</p>
<p>
"You make me feel real mean," she said.
</p>
<p>
He kept a sturdy back to her.
</p>
<p>
"Then A make you feel just same gate as A feel maself."
</p>
<p>
There was a pause.
</p>
<p>
"You ought to marry, Joe—a man like you with all
that nature in you."
</p>
<p>
"Never—only if so be A can get the woman A want."
</p>
<p>
She said with a gulp,
</p>
<p>
"And I thart you was Ern's friend!"
</p>
<p>
He looked up at the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
"So A am—trying to be."
</p>
<p>
There was another silence.  Then the woman spoke
again, this time with the hushed curiosity of a child.
</p>
<p>
"Are all men like that?"
</p>
<p>
"The main of em, A reck'n."
</p>
<p>
Her hand swooped rhythmically; and there was the
gentle accompanying thud of the iron taking the table and
circling smoothly about its work.
</p>
<p>
"My Ern isn't."
</p>
<p>
"Your Ern's got what he wants—and what A want too."
</p>
<p>
Boots brushing themselves on the mat outside made
themselves heard.  Then the door opened.
</p>
<p>
Joe did not turn.
</p>
<p>
"Coom in, Ern," he said.  "Just right.  Keep t'
peace atween us.  She and me gettin across each other
as usual."

CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
A SKIRMISH
</h3>
<p>
A few days later Ernie came home immediately after
work instead of repairing to the <i>Star</i>.  As he entered the
room Ruth saw there was something up.  He was
sober—terribly so.
</p>
<p>
"I done it, Ruth, old lass," he said.
</p>
<p>
She knew at once.
</p>
<p>
"Got the sack?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
He nodded.
</p>
<p>
"I've no one to blame only meself," he said, disarming
her, as he disarmed everyone by his Christian quality.
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not reproach him: that was not her way.
Nor did she sit down and cry: she had expected the
catastrophe too long.  She took the boy from the cradle
and opened her bodice.
</p>
<p>
"You shan't suffer anyways," she said, half to herself,
half to the child, and stared out of the window, babe at
breast, rocking gently and with tapping foot.
</p>
<p>
Ern slouched out; and Ruth was left alone, to face as
best she could the spectre that haunts through life the path
of the immense majority of the human race.  She had
watched its slinking approach for years.  Now with a patter
of hushed feet, dreadful in the fury of its assault, it was on
her.  Remorseless in attack as in pursuit it was hounding
her and hers slowly down a dreary slope to a lingering
death, of body and spirit alike, in that hungry morass, the
name of which is Unemployment.
</p>
<p>
Two days later when Joe entered the cottage he found
Ruth for once sitting, listless.  All the children were in
bed, even little Alice.  He saw at once why.  There was
no fire, though it was January.
</p>
<p>
"Where's Ern, then?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Lookin for work," Ruth answered.
</p>
<p>
Joe stared, aghast.
</p>
<p>
"Is he out?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Ruth rose and turned her shoulder to him.
</p>
<p>
"Yes.  They've stood him off.  And I don't blame em."
</p>
<p>
"What for?" Joe was genuinely concerned.
</p>
<p>
"He didn't say.  Bad time, I reckon.  Only don't
tell anyone, Joe, for dear's sake, else they'll stop my credit
at the shop—and I'll be done."
</p>
<p>
Her eyes filled and she bit her lip.
</p>
<p>
"Four of em," she said.  "And nothing a week to do
it on—let alone the rent" ...
</p>
<p>
She might hush it up; but the news spread.
</p>
<p>
Alf, with his ears of a lynx, was one of the first to hear.
For a moment he hovered in a dreadful state of trepidation.
It was a year and a half since he had stalked his white
heifer, bent on a kill, only to be scared away by the presence
of that mysterious old man he had found at her side in the
heart of the covert.  But his lust was by no means dead
because it had been for the time suppressed.  Ruth had
baffled him; and Alf had not forgotten it.  Ern possessed
a beautiful woman he longed for; and Alf had not forgiven
him.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps because he had beaten down his desire for so
long, it now rushed out ravening from its lair, and drove all
else before it.  Throwing caution to the winds, he came
stealing along like a stoat upon the trail, licking his lips,
wary yet swift.  First he made sure that Ernie was out,
looking for a job of work.  Then he came down the street.
</p>
<p>
Ruth met her enemy blithely and with taunting eyes.
In battle she found a certain relief from the burthen of
her distress.  And here she knew was no question of pity
or consideration.
</p>
<p>
"Monday's your morning, isn't it?" she said.  "Come
along then, will you, Alf?  And you'll see what I got for
you."
</p>
<p>
Alf shook a sorrowful head, studying his rent-book.
</p>
<p>
"It can't go on," he said in the highly moral tone he
loved to adopt.  "It ain't right."  He raised a pained face
and looked away.  "Of course if you was to wish to wipe
it off and start clean——"
</p>
<p>
Ruth was cold and smiling.  She handled Alf always
with the caressing contempt with which a cat handles a
mouse.
</p>
<p>
"Little bit of accommodation," she said.  "No thank
you, Alf.  I shouldn't feel that'd help me to start clean."
</p>
<p>
"See Ern's down and out," continued the tempter in
his hushed and confidential voice.  "Nobody won't give
him a job."
</p>
<p>
Ruth trembled slightly, though she was smiling still
and self-contained.
</p>
<p>
"You'll see to that now you're on high, won't you?"
she said—"for my children's sake."
</p>
<p>
"It'd be doin Ern a good turn, too," Alf went on in the
same low monotone.
</p>
<p>
"Brotherly," said Ruth.  "But he mightn't see it
that way."
</p>
<p>
"He wouldn't mind," continued Alf gently.  "See he's
all for Joe Burt and the classes now.  Says you're keeping
him back.  Nothin but a burthen to him, he says.  <i>Her and
her brats</i>, as he said last night at the Institute.  <i>Don't give
a chap a chance</i>."  Alf wagged his head.  "Course he
shouldn't ha said it.  I know that.  Told him so at the
time afore them all.  <i>Tain't right</i>—I told him straight—<i>your
own wife and all</i>."
</p>
<p>
"My Ern didn't say that, Alf," Ruth answered simply.
</p>
<p>
His eyes came seeking hers furtively, and were gone
instantly on meeting them.
</p>
<p>
"Then you won't do him a good turn?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth's fine eyes flashed and danced, irony, laughter,
scorn, all crossing swords in their brown deeps.  There
were aspects of Alf that genuinely amused her.
</p>
<p>
"Would you like to talk it over with him?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"And supposing I have?"
</p>
<p>
"He'll be back in a moment," she said, sweet and
bright.  "I'll ask him."
</p>
<p>
Alf was silent, fumbling with his watch-chain.  Then
he began again in the same hushed voice, and with the same
averted face.
</p>
<p>
"And there's another thing between us."  His eyes were
shut, and he was weaving to and fro like a snake in the
love-dance.  "Sorry you're trying to make bad blood between
me and my old dad," he said.  "Very sorry, Ruth."
</p>
<p>
"I aren't," Ruth answered swiftly.  "You was always
un-friends from the cradle, you and dad.  See he don't
think you're right."  She added a little stab of her
own—"No one does.  That's why they keep you on as sidesman,
Mr. Chislehurst says.  Charity-like.  They're sorry for
you.  So'm I."
</p>
<p>
The words touched Alf's vital spot—the conceit that
was the most obvious symptom of his insanity.  His face
changed, but his voice remained as before, stealthy and
insinuating.  He came a little closer, and his eyes caressed
her figure covetously.
</p>
<p>
"You see I wouldn't annoy me, not too far, not if I
was you, Ruth.  You can go too far even with a saint
upon the cross."
</p>
<p>
Ruth put out the tip of her tongue daintily.
</p>
<p>
"Crook upon the cross, don't you mean, Alf?"
</p>
<p>
He brushed the irrelevancy aside, shooting his head
across to hers.  His face was ugly now, and glistening.
With deliberate insolence he flicked a thumb and finger
under her nose.
</p>
<p>
"And I do know what I do know, and what nobody
else don't know only you and me and the Captin, my
tuppenny tartlet."
</p>
<p>
She was still and white, formidable in her very dumbness.
He proceeded with quiet stealth.
</p>
<p>
"See that letter I wrote you used to hold over against
me before you married—that's destroyed now.  And a
good job, too, for it might have meant trouble for Alfured.
But it's gone!  I <i>know</i> that then.  Ern told me.  He's a
drunkard, old Ern is; but he's not a liar.  I will say that
for my brother; I will stick up for him if it was ever so;
I will fight old Ern's battles for him."
</p>
<p>
"As you're doin now," said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Alf grinned.
</p>
<p>
"And the short of it all is just this, Ruthie," he
continued, and reaching forth a hand, tapped her upon the
shoulder—"I got you, and you ain't got me.  And I can
squeeze the heart out of that great bosom o yours"—he
opened and clenched his hand in pantomine—"if I don't
get my way any time I like.  So just you think it over!
Think o your children if you won't think of nothing else!"
</p>
<p>
Outside in the road he ran into Joe, who gripped him.
</p>
<p>
"What you come after?" asked the engineer ferociously.
</p>
<p>
"After my rent," answered Alf, shouting from fear.
Joe looked dangerous, but loosed his hold.
</p>
<p>
"How much?" he asked, taking a bag from his pocket.
</p>
<p>
"Sixteen shilling.  You can see for yourself."
</p>
<p>
Obliging with the obligingness of the man who is scared
to death, Alf produced his book.  Joe, lowering still, examined
it.  Then he paid the money into the other's hand.  That
done he escorted Alf policemanwise to the bottom of
Borough Lane.
</p>
<p>
"If A find you mouchin round here again A'll break
your bloody little back across ma knee," he told the other,
shouldering over him.  "A mean it, sitha!"
</p>
<p>
Alf withdrew up the hill towards the <i>Star</i>.  At a safe
distance he paused and called back confidentially, his face
white and sneering,
</p>
<p>
"Quite the yard-dog, eh?  Bought her, ain't yer?"
</p>
<p>
Joe returned to the cottage and entered.
</p>
<p>
At the head of the stairs a lovely little figure in a white
gown that enfolded her hugely like a cloud, making billows
about the woolly red slippers which had been Bess Trupp's
Christmas gift, smiled at him.
</p>
<p>
"Uncle Joe," little Alice chirped, "please tell Mum I
are ready."
</p>
<p>
He ran up the stairs, gathered her in his arms, and bore
her back to bed in the room where Susie and Jenny already
slept.
</p>
<p>
"Hush!" she whispered, laying a tiny finger on his
lips—"The little ones!"
</p>
<p>
He tucked her up and kissed her.
</p>
<p>
"You're the proper little mother, aren't you?" he
whispered.
</p>
<p>
In the kitchen he found Ruth, a row of tin-tacks studding
her lips, soling Alice's boots.  The glint of steel between her
lips, and the inward curl of her lips, gave her a touch of
unusual grimness.
</p>
<p>
"Always at it," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," she answered between muffled lips.  "Got to
be.  Snob this time.  Only the soles are rotten.  It's like
puttin nails into wet brown paper."
</p>
<p>
She was suffering terribly—he felt it; and suppressed
accordingly.  But if her furnaces were damped down, he
could hear the flames roaring behind closed doors; and her
passion, which typified for him the sufferings of those
innocent millions to the redemption of whom he had consecrated
his life, moved him profoundly.
</p>
<p>
He flung the bag on the table before her almost savagely.
It jingled as it fell and squatted there, dowdy, and
lackadaisical as a dumpling in a swoon.
</p>
<p>
Ruth eyed it, her lips still steel-studded.
</p>
<p>
"How much?" she mumbled.
</p>
<p>
"Ten pound," he answered.
</p>
<p>
"That's not what I mean."
</p>
<p>
"What <i>do</i> you mean, then?"
</p>
<p>
"What's the price?"
</p>
<p>
He glared at her; then thumped the table with a great
fist.
</p>
<p>
"Nothin then!" he shouted.  "What doest' take me
for?"
</p>
<p>
She munched her tin-tacks sardonically, regarding him.
</p>
<p>
How sturdy he was, with his close curly black hair, and
on his face the set and resolute look of the man approaching
middle-age, who knows that he wants and how to win it!
</p>
<p>
"A man, Joe."
</p>
<p>
He snorted sullenly.
</p>
<p>
"Better'n a no-man any road," he sneered.
</p>
<p>
The words stung her.  All the immense and tender
motherliness of her nature rose up like a wave that curls in
roaring majesty to a fall.  She swept the tin-tacks from her
mouth and met him, flashing and glorious.
</p>
<p>
"See here, Joe!" she cried, deep-voiced as a bloodhound.
"Ne'er a word against my Ern!  I won't have it."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Your</i> Ern!"
</p>
<p>
She was white and heaving.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, my Ern!  He's down and out, and you take advantage
to come up here behind his back and insult him—and
me.  You're the one to call anudder man a no-man, aren't
you?"  Taking the bag of money she tossed it at him with
a flinging scorn that was magnificent.
</p>
<p>
"Take your filth away—and yourself with it!"
</p>
<p>
He went, humbled and ashamed.
</p>
<p>
She watched him go—this sanguine, well-conditioned
man, with his good boots, his sensible clothes, his air of solid
prosperity.
</p>
<p>
Then she sat down, spent.  Her savagery had been
largely defensive.  Like the brave soldier she was she had
attacked to hide the weakness of her guard.  She was sick
at heart; worn out.  These men ... first Alf, then Joe ...
This champing boar, foam in the corner of his lips ... that
red-eyed weasel squealing on the trail....
</p>
<p>
An hour later Ern came home.
</p>
<p>
She knew at once from the wan look of him that he had
been tramping all day on an empty stomach.  That, with
all his faults, was Ern.  So long as there was a crumb in the
cupboard she and the children should share it: he would
tighten his belt.  Even now he just sat down, an obviously
beaten man, and did not ask for a bite.  What she had she
put before him; and it was not much.
</p>
<p>
"Any luck, Ern?" she asked with a touch of tenderness.
</p>
<p>
Sullenly he shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"Walked my bloody legs off on an empty belly, and got
a mouthful of insults at the end of it," he muttered.  "That's
all I got.  That's all they give the working man in Old
England.  Joe's right.  Sink the country!  Blast the
bloody Empire!  That's all it's good for!"
</p>
<p>
It was the first time he had ever used bad language in
her presence.  That gradual demoralisation which
unemployment, however caused, and its consequences brings
inevitably in its train was already showing its corrupt
fruits.  The tragedy of it moved her.
</p>
<p>
"Joe's been up," she said after a bit.
</p>
<p>
"I met him," he answered.  He was warmer after his
meal, less sullen, and drew up his chair from habit before
the fireless range.  "He wants me to go North—to
his folk.  Says his brother-in-law can find me a job.  Runs
a motor-transport business in Oldham."
</p>
<p>
Her back was to him at the moment.
</p>
<p>
"Does he?" she asked quietly.  "What about me and
my children?"
</p>
<p>
"That's what I says to him."
</p>
<p>
"What did he say?"
</p>
<p>
"Said he'd look after you and them."
</p>
<p>
Ruth was still as a mouse awaiting the cat's pounce.
</p>
<p>
"And what did you say to that?"
</p>
<p>
"Told him to go to hell."
</p>
<p>
Ruth stirred again and resumed her quiet busyness.
</p>
<p>
"Alf's been up again," she told him.  "Messin round."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
PITCHED BATTLE
</h3>
<p>
Mrs. Trubb happened on Ernie's mother next day in
Church Street.  The surgeon's wife, whenever she met
Mrs. Edward Caspar, acted always deliberately on the assumption,
which she knew to be unfounded, that relations between
Ruth and her mother-in-law were normal.
</p>
<p>
"It's a nuisance this about Ernie," she now said.  "Such
a worry for Ruth."
</p>
<p>
The hard woman with the snow-white hair and fierce
black eye-brows made a little sardonic moue.
</p>
<p>
"She's all right," she answered.  "You needn't worry
for her.  There's a chap payin her rent."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp changed colour.
</p>
<p>
"I don't believe it," she said sharply.
</p>
<p>
"You mayn't believe it," retorted the other sourly.
"It's true all the same.  Alf's her landlord.  He told me."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp, greatly perturbed, reported the matter to
her husband.  He tackled Alf, who at the moment was
driving for his old employer again in the absence of the
regular chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
Alf admitted readily enough that the charge against
his sister-in-law was true.
</p>
<p>
"That's it, sir," he said.  "It's that chap Burt.  And
he don't do what he done for nothin, I'll lay; a chap like
that don't."
</p>
<p>
He produced his book from his pocket, and held it out
for the other to see, half turning away with becoming
modesty.
</p>
<p>
"I don't like it, sir—me own sister-in-law.  And I've
said so to Reverend Spink.  Makes talk, as they say.  Still
it's no concern of mine."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp, on hearing her husband's report, went down
at once to see Ruth and point out the extraordinary
unwisdom of her action.
</p>
<p>
Ruth met her, fierce and formidable as Mrs. Trupp had
never known her.
</p>
<p>
"It's a lie," she said, deep and savage as a tigress.
</p>
<p>
"It may be," Mrs. Trupp admitted.  "But Alfred did
show Mr. Trupp his book.  And the rent had been paid
down to last Monday.  I think you should ask Mr. Burt."
</p>
<p>
That evening when Joe came up Ruth straightway
tackled him.
</p>
<p>
She was so cold, so terrible, that the engineer was
frightened, and lied.
</p>
<p>
"Not as I'd ha blamed you if you had," said Ruth
relaxing ever so little.  "It's not your fault I'm put to it
and shamed afore em all."
</p>
<p>
The bitterness of the position in which Ern had placed
her was eating her heart away.  That noon for the first time
she had taken the three elder children to the public dinner
for necessitous children at the school.  Anne Caspar who
had been there helping to serve had smirked.
</p>
<p>
When Joe saw that the weight of her anger was turned
against Ernie and not him, he admitted his fault.
</p>
<p>
"A may ha done wrong," he said.  "But A acted for the
best.  Didn't want to see you in young Alf's clutches."
</p>
<p>
"You bide here," Ruth said, "and keep house along o
little Alice.  I'll be back in a minute."
</p>
<p>
Hatless and just as she was, she marched up to the
Manor-house.
</p>
<p>
"You were right, 'M," she told Mrs. Trupp.  "It were
Joe.  He just tell me.  Only I didn't knaw nothin of it."
</p>
<p>
"It'll never do for you to be in his debt, Ruth," said
the lady.
</p>
<p>
"No," Ruth admitted sullenly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp went to her escritoire and took out sixteen
shillings.  Ruth took it.
</p>
<p>
"Thank-you," was all she said, and she said that
coldly.  Then she returned home with the money and paid
Joe.
</p>
<p>
An hour later Ernie came in.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was standing at the table waiting him, cold, tall,
and inexorable.
</p>
<p>
"Anything?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Surly in self-defence, he shook his head and sat down.
</p>
<p>
She gave him not so much as a crumb of sympathy.
</p>
<p>
"No good settin down," she told him.  "You ain't
done yet.  You'll take that clock down to Goldmann's
after dark, and you'll get sixteen shillings for it.  If he
won't give you that for it, you'll pop your own great coat."
</p>
<p>
Ernie stared at her.  He was uncertain whether to show
fight or not.
</p>
<p>
"Dad's clock?—what he give me when I married?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes.  Dad's clock."
</p>
<p>
She regarded him with eyes in which resentment flamed
sullenly.
</p>
<p>
"Can I feed six on the shilling a week he gives me—rent
and all?"
</p>
<p>
Ernie went out and brought back the money.  She took
it without a word, and wrapping it up in a little bit of
paper, left it at the Manor-house.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp, who was holding a council with Bess and
Bobby Chislehurst, unwrapped the packet and showed the
money.
</p>
<p>
"She's put something up the spout," said the sage
Bobby.
</p>
<p>
The three talked the situation over.  There was only
one thing to be done.  Somebody must go round to
Mr. Pigott and intercede for Ernie.  Bobby was selected.
</p>
<p>
"You'll get him round if anybody can," Bess told her
colleague encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
Bobby, shaking a dubious head, went.  Mr. Pigott, like
everybody else in Old Town, was devoted to the young
curate; but he presented a firm face now to the other's
entreaties.
</p>
<p>
"Every chance I've given him."  he said, and scolded and
growled as he paced to and fro in the little room looking
across Victoria Drive on to the allotments.  "He's a
lost soul, is Ernie Caspar.  That's my view, if you care
for it."
</p>
<p>
Bobby retreated, not without hope, and bustled round
to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"You must go and see him!" he rapped out almost
imperiously—"yourself—this evening—after work—at
6.30—to the minute."  He would be praying at that hour.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, who was fighting for her life now, went.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott, at the window, saw her coming.
</p>
<p>
"Here she comes," he murmured.  "O dear me!  You
women, you know, you're the curse of my life.  I'd be a
good and happy man only for you."
</p>
<p>
Mrs Pigott was giggling at his elbow.
</p>
<p>
"She'll get round you, all right, my son," she said.
"She'll roll you up in two ticks till you're just a little
round ball of nothing in particular, and then gulp you
down."
</p>
<p>
"She won't!" the other answered truculently.  "You
don't know me!"  And he swaggered masterfully away to
meet the foe.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Pigott proved, of course, right.
</p>
<p>
Ruth's simplicity and beauty were altogether too much
for the susceptible old man.  He put up no real fight at
all; but after a little bluff and bounce surrendered
unconditionally with a good many loud words to salve his
conscience and cover his defeat.
</p>
<p>
"It's only postponing the evil day, I'm afraid," he said;
but he agreed to take the sinner back at a lower wage to
do a more menial job—if he'd come.
</p>
<p>
"He'll come, sir," said Ruth.  "He's humble.  I will
say that for Ern."
</p>
<p>
"Send him to me," said the old schoolmaster threateningly.
"I'll dress him down.  What he wants is to get
religion."
</p>
<p>
"He's got religion, sir," answered simple Ruth.  "Only
where it is it's no good to him."
</p>
<p>
That evening, when Ern entered, heavy once again with
defeat, she told him the news.  At the moment she
was standing at the sink washing up, and did not
even turn to face him.  He made as though to approach
her and then halted.  Something about her back forbade
him.
</p>
<p>
"It shan't happen again, Ruth," he said.
</p>
<p>
She met him remorseless as a rock of granite.
</p>
<p>
"No, not till next time," she answered.
</p>
<p>
He stood a moment eyeing her back hungrily.  Then he
went out.
</p>
<p>
He was hardly gone when his father lumbered into the
kitchen.  The old gentleman's eyes fell at once on the
clock-deserted mantel-piece.
</p>
<p>
"Gone to be mended," he said to himself, and took out
of his waistcoat pocket the huge old gold watch with a
coat of arms on the back, beloved of the children, that had
itself some fifteen years before made a romantic pilgrimage
to Mr. Goldmann's in Sea-gate.  Then he bustled to the
cupboard where was the box containing a hammer and a
few tools.  He put a nail in the wall, hammered his thumb,
sucked it with a good deal of slobber, but got the nail in at
last.
</p>
<p>
"Without any help too," he said to himself, not without
a touch of complacency as he hung the watch on it.  Ruth
watched him with wistful affection.  Pleased with himself
and his action, as is only the man who rarely uses his hands,
he stood back and admired his work.
</p>
<p>
"There!" he said.  "Didn't know I was a handy
man, did you?  It'll keep you going anyway till the clock
comes back."
</p>
<p>
He left more hurriedly than usual, and when he was
gone Ruth found two shillings on the mantel-piece.
</p>
<p>
The old man's kindness and her own sense of humiliation
were too much for Ruth.  She went out into the back-yard;
and there Joe found her, standing like a school-girl, her
hands behind her, looking up at the church-tower.
</p>
<p>
Quietly he came to her and peeped round at her face,
which was crumpled and furrowed, the tears pouring down.
</p>
<p>
"I'd as lief give up all together for all the good it is,"
she gulped between her sobs.
</p>
<p>
He put out his hand to gather her.  She turned on him,
her eyes smouldering and sullen beneath the water-floods.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you, would you?" she snarled.
</p>
<p>
As she faced him he saw that the brooch she usually
wore at her throat was gone, and her neck, round and full,
was exposed.
</p>
<p>
She saw the direction of his eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," she said, "that's gone too.  I'll be lucky soon if
I'm left the clothes I stand up in."
</p>
<p>
He put out a sturdy finger and stroked her bare throat.
She struck it aside with ferocity.
</p>
<p>
"What <i>do</i> you want then?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"You know what I want," she answered huskily.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?"
</p>
<p>
"A man—to make a home and keep the children."
</p>
<p>
"Well, here's one a-waitin."
</p>
<p>
She flung him off and moved heavily into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Just then there was a tap at the window.  It was little
Alice calling for her mother to come and tuck her up.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
THE VANQUISHED
</h3>
<p>
When Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor called at the Manor-house
a few days later, Mrs. Trupp told them what had happened.
</p>
<p>
"Burt paid her rent?" queried the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Without her knowledge," said Mrs. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel shrugged.
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid our friend Ernie's a poor creature," he
said.  "Wishy-washy!  That's about the long and short
of it."
</p>
<p>
"And yet he's got it in him!" commented Mrs. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"That's what I say," remarked Mrs. Lewknor with a
touch of aggressiveness.  The little lady, with the fine
loyalty that was her characteristic, never forgot whose
son Ernie was, nor her first meeting with him years before
in hospital at Jubbulpur.  "He's got plenty in him; but
she don't dig it out."
</p>
<p>
"He got a good fright though, this time," said Bess.
"It may steady him."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp shot forth one of his short epigrams, solid
and chunky as a blow from a hammer.
</p>
<p>
"Men won't till they must," he said.  "It's Must has
been the making of Man.  He'll try when he's got to, and
not a moment before."
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor were
walking down Church Street towards the station.  Just in
front of them a woman and two men were marching a-breast.
The woman was flanked by her comrades.
</p>
<p>
"What a contrast those two men make," remarked the
Colonel.  "That feller Burt's like a bull!"
</p>
<p>
"Too like," retorted Mrs. Lewknor sharply.  "Give
me the fellow who's like a gentleman."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"Flame burns too feebly."
</p>
<p>
"But it burns pure," snapped the little lady.
</p>
<p>
Both parties had reached the foot of the hill at the Goffs
when the woman in front swerved.  It was the motion of
the bird in flight suddenly aware of a man with a gun.
She passed through the stile and fled swiftly across Saffrons
Croft.  The men with her, evidently taken by surprise,
followed.
</p>
<p>
Only the Colonel saw what had happened.
</p>
<p>
A tall man, coming from the station, had turned into
Alf's garage.
</p>
<p>
"Royal," he said low to his companion.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Captain Royal had come down to Beachbourne to see
Alf Caspar, who wanted more capital for his Syndicate
which was prospering amazingly.  Alf, indeed, now that he
had established his garages in every important centre in
East Sussex, was starting a Road-touring Syndicate to
exploit for visitors the hidden treasures of a country-side
amazingly rich in historic memories for men of Anglo-Saxon
blood.  The Syndicate was to begin operations with a
flourish on the Easter Bank Holiday, if the necessary licence
could be obtained from the Watch Committee; and Alf
anticipated little real trouble in that matter.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp and her daughter, who had never forgiven
Alf for being Alf, watched the growing prosperity of the
Syndicate and its promoter with undisguised annoyance.
</p>
<p>
"It beats me," said Bess, "why people back the little
beast.  Everybody knows all about him."
</p>
<p>
Next day as they rode down the valley towards Birling
Gap, Mr. Trupp expounded to his daughter the secret of
Alf's success.
</p>
<p>
"When you're as old as I am, my dear, and have had as
long an experience as I have of this slip-shod world, you'll
know that people will forgive almost anything to a man who
gets things done and is reliable.  Alf drove me for nearly
ten years tens of thousands of miles; and I never knew him
to have a break-down on the road.  Why?—because he
took trouble."
</p>
<p>
Alf, indeed, with all his amazing deficiencies, mental and
moral, was a supremely honest workman.  He never scamped
a job, and was never satisfied with anything but the best.
He was gloriously work-proud.  A hard master, he was
hardest on himself, as all the men in his yard knew.  One
and all they disliked him; one and all they respected
him—because he could beat them at their own job.  His
work was his solitary passion, and he was an artist at it.
Here he was not even petty.  Good work, and a good
workman, found in him their most wholehearted supporter.
</p>
<p>
"That's a job!" he'd say to a mechanic.  "I
congratulate you."
</p>
<p>
"You should know, Mr. Caspar," the man would answer,
pleased and purring.  For Alf's reputation as the best
motor-engineer in East Sussex was well-established and
well-earned.  And because he was efficient and thorough
the success of his Syndicate was never in doubt.
</p>
<p>
Alf was on the way now, in truth, to becoming a rich
man.  Yet he lived simply enough above his original
garage in the Goffs at the foot of Old Town.  And from that
eyrie, busy though he was, he still made time to watch with
interest and pleasure his brother's trousers coming down
and indeed to lend a helping hand in the process: for he
worked secretly on his mother, who regarded Ernie when he
came to Rectory Walk to take his father out with eyes of
increasing displeasure; for her eldest son was shabby and
seedy almost now as in the days when he had been out of
work after leaving the Hohenzollern.  The word failure
was stamped upon him in letters few could mis-read.  And
Anne Caspar had for all those who fail, with one exception,
that profound sense of exasperation and disgust which finds
its outlet in the contemptuous pity that is for modern man
the camouflaged expression of the cruelty inherent in his
animal nature.  It seemed that all the love in her—and
there was love in her as surely there is in us all—was
exhausted on her own old man.  For the rest her attitude
towards the fallen in the arena was always <i>Thumbs down</i>—with
perhaps an added zest of rancour and resentment
because of the one she spared.
</p>
<p>
"She has brought you low," she commented one evening
to Ernie in that pseudo-mystical voice, as of one talking in
her sleep, from the covert of which some women hope to
shoot their poisoned arrows with impunity.  This time,
however, she was not to escape just punishment.
</p>
<p>
Ernie flared.
</p>
<p>
"Who says she has then?"
</p>
<p>
Anne Caspar had struck a spark of reality out of the
moss-covered flint; and now—as had happened at rare intervals
throughout his life—Ernie made his mother suddenly
afraid.
</p>
<p>
"Everyone," she said, lamely, trying vainly to cover
her retreat.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Ernie, nodding.  "I knaw who, and I'll
let him knaw it too."
</p>
<p>
"Best be cautious," replied his mother with a smirk.
"He's your landlord now.  And you're behind."
</p>
<p>
Ernie rose.
</p>
<p>
"He may be my landlord," he cried.  "But I'm the
daddy o he yet."
</p>
<p>
Sullenly he returned to the house that was now for him
no home: for the woman who had made it home was punishing
not without just cause the man who had betrayed it.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Ruth was standing now like a rock in the tide-way, the
passions of men beating about her, her children clinging to
her, the grey sky of circumstance enfolding her.
</p>
<p>
She had sought adventure and had found it.  Battle now
was hers; but it was battle stripped of all romance.  Danger
beset her; but it was wholly sordid.  The battle was for
bread—to feed her household; and soap—to keep her home
and children clean.  The danger was lest all the creeping
diseases and hideous disabilities contingent upon penury,
unknown even by name except in their grossest form to the
millions whose lot it is to face and fight them day in, day out,
should sap the powers of resistance of her and hers, and
throw them on the scrap-heap at the mercy of Man, the
merciless.
</p>
<p>
Tragic was her dilemma.  To Ruth her home was
everything because it meant the environment in which she
must grow the souls and bodies of her children.  And her
home was threatened.  That was the position, stark and
terrible, which stared her in the eyes by day and night.
The man provided her by the law had proved a No-man,
as Joe called it.  He was a danger to the home of which he
should have been the support.  And while her own man
had failed her, another, a true man as she believed, was
offering to take upon his strong and capable shoulders the
burthen Ernie was letting fall.
</p>
<p>
Ruth agonised and well she might.  For Joe was pressing
in upon her, overpowering her, hammering at her gate with
always fiercer insistence.  Should she surrender?—should
she open the gate of a citadel of which the garrison was
starved and the ammunition all but spent?—should she
fight on?
</p>
<p>
Through the muffled confusion and darkness of her
mind, above the tumult of cries old and new besetting her,
came always the still small voice, heard through the hubbub
by reason of its very quiet, that said—Fight.  Inherently
spiritual as she was, Ruth gave ear to it, putting forth the
whole of her strength to meet the enemy, who was too much
her friend, and overthrow him.
</p>
<p>
Yet she could not forget that she owed her position to
Ernie, since at every hour of every day she was being pricked
by the ubiquitous pin of poverty.  Fighting now with her
back to the wall, for her home and children, and stern
because of it, she did not spare him.  When Ernie called
her hard, as he was never tired of doing, she answered
simply,
</p>
<p>
"I got to be."
</p>
<p>
"No need to bully a chap so then," Ernie complained.
"A'ter all I am a human being though I may be your
husband."
</p>
<p>
"You're not the only one I got to think of," replied
Ruth remorselessly.  "And it's no good talking.  I shan't
forgive you till you've won back the position you lost when
he sack you.  Half a dollar a week makes just the difference
between can and can't to me.  See, I can't goo to the
wash-tub now as I could to make up one time o day when I'd only
the one.  So I must look to you.  And if I look in vain
you got to hear about it.  I mean it, Ernie," she continued.
"I'm fairly up against it.  There's no gettin round me this
time.  And if you won't think o me, you might think o
the children.  It's they who suffer."
</p>
<p>
She had touched the spot this time.
</p>
<p>
"Steady with it then!" cried Ernie angrily.  "Don't
I think o you and the children?"
</p>
<p>
"Not as you should," answered Ruth calmly.  "Not by
no means.  We should come first.  Four of them now—and
twenty-two bob to keep em on.  Tain't in reason."
</p>
<p>
She faced him with calm and resolute eyes.
</p>
<p>
"And it mustn't happen again, Ern," she said.  "See,
it's too much.  Nobody's fault but your own."
</p>
<p>
Ernie went out in sullen mood, and for the first time
since the smash turned into the <i>Star</i>.  He had not been
there many minutes when a navvy, clouded with liquor,
leaned over and inquired friendly how his barstards were.
</p>
<p>
Ern set down his mug.
</p>
<p>
"What's this then?" he asked, very still.
</p>
<p>
The fellow leaned forward, leering, a great hand plaistered
on either knee.
</p>
<p>
"Don't you know what a bloody barstard is?" he asked.
He was too drunk to be afraid; too drunk to be accountable.
Ernie dealt with him as a doctor deals with a refractory
invalid—patiently.
</p>
<p>
"Who's been sayin it?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Your own blood-brother—Alf."
</p>
<p>
Ernie tossed off his half-pint, rose, and went out.
</p>
<p>
He walked fast down the hill to the Goffs.  People
marked him as he passed, and the look upon his face: he
did not see them.
</p>
<p>
Alf was in his garage, talking to a man.  The man wore
a burberry and a jaeger hat, with a hackle stuck in the
riband.  There was something jaunty and sword-like about
him.  Ern, as he drew rapidly closer, recognised him.  It
was Captain Royal.  The conjunction of the two men at
that moment turned his heart to steel.
</p>
<p>
He was walking; but he seemed to himself to be sliding
over the earth towards his enemies, swift and stealthy as a
hunting panther.  As he went he clutched his fists and knew
that they were damp and very cold.
</p>
<p>
When Ernie was within a hundred yards of him Royal,
all unconscious of the presence of his enemy, swung out of
the garage and walked off in his rapid, resolute way.
</p>
<p>
Alf went slowly up the steps into his office.
</p>
<p>
He was grinning to himself.
</p>
<p>
"'Alf a mo then!" said Ernie quietly, hard on his heels.
"Just a word with you, Alf."
</p>
<p>
Alf turned, saw his brother crossing the yard, marked
the danger-flare on his face, remembered it of old, and bolted
incontinently, without shame, locking the house door
behind him.
</p>
<p>
Ern hammered on the door.
</p>
<p>
Alf peeped out of an upper window, upset a jug of water
over his brother, and in his panic fury flung the jug after
it.  It broke on Ernie's head and crashed to pieces on
the step.
</p>
<p>
Ernie, gasping, and bleeding from the head, staggered
back into the road, half-stunned.  Then he began to tear
off his sopping clothes and throw them down into the dust
at his feet.  His voice was quiet as his face, smeared with
blood, was moved.
</p>
<p>
"You've got to ave it!" he called up to his brother.
"May as well come and ave it now as wait for it."
</p>
<p>
There had been a big football match on the Saffrons,
and the crowd were just flocking away, in mood for a lark.
The drenched and bleeding man stripping in the road, the
broken crockery on the door-step, the white-faced fellow at
the window, promised just the sensation they sought.
Joyfully they gathered to see.  Here was just the right finale
pleasant Saturday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
"I'm your landlord!" screamed Alf.  "Remember
that!  I'll make you pay for this!"
</p>
<p>
"Will you?" answered Ernie, truculent and cool.
"Then I'll have my money's worth first."
</p>
<p>
This heroic sentiment was loudly applauded by the
crowd, who felt an added sympathy for Ern now they knew
he was attacking his landlord, one of a class loathed by all
good men.
</p>
<p>
Just then Joe Burt emerged from the crowd and took
the tumultuous figure of Ernie in his arms.
</p>
<p>
"Coom, then!" he said.  "This'll never do for a Labour
Leader.  This isna the Highway you should be trampin
along."
</p>
<p>
The crowd protested.  It was an exhilarating scene—better
than the pictures, some opined.  And here was a
blighter, who talked funny talk, interfering.
</p>
<p>
"Just like these hem furriners," said an old man.
"Ca-a-n't let well a-be."
</p>
<p>
Then, happily, or unhappily, the police, who exist to
spoil the people's fun, appeared on the scene.
</p>
<p>
They made a little blue knot round Ernie, who stood
in the midst of them, stripped and dripping, with something
of the forlorn look of a shorn ewe that has just been dipped.
</p>
<p>
Alf, secure now in the presence of the officers of the law,
descended from his window and came down the steps of
his house towards the growing crowd.  A tall man joined
him.  The pair forced their way through the press to the
police.
</p>
<p>
"I'm Captain Royal," said the tall man, coldly.  "I
saw what happened."
</p>
<p>
Joe turned on the new-comer.  His clothes, his class, a
touch of insolence about his tone and bearing, roused all
the combative instincts of the engineer.
</p>
<p>
"You wasn't standin by then!" he said ferociously.
"You only just come up.  A saw you."
</p>
<p>
The other ignored him, drawing a card from an elegant
case.
</p>
<p>
"Here's my card," he said to the police.  "If you want
my evidence you'll know where to find me."
</p>
<p>
Joe boiled over.
</p>
<p>
"That's the gentleman of England touch!" he sneered.
"Swear away a workin man's life for the price of half a
pint, they would!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah!  I know him!" muttered Ernie, white still, and
trembling.
</p>
<p>
"Enough of it now," growled a big policeman, making
notes in his pocket-book.
</p>
<p>
Just then the crowd parted and a woman came through.
A shawl was wrapped about her head and face.  Only her
eyes were seen, dark under dark hair.
</p>
<p>
A moment she stood surrounded by the four men who
had desired or possessed her.  Then she put her hand on
the shirt-sleeve of her husband.
</p>
<p>
"Ern," she said, and turned away.
</p>
<p>
He followed her submissively through the crowd,
slipping his shirt over his head.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly the woman walked away up the hill.  Her scarecrow,
his trousers sopping and sagging about his boots,
trudged behind.
</p>
<p>
The crowd looked after them in silence.  Then Joe broke
away and followed at a distance.
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked back and saw him.
</p>
<p>
"Let us be, Joe," she called.
</p>
<p>
Joe turned away.  His eyes were full of tears.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
THUNDER
</h3>
<p>
The two brothers had to appear before the Bench on Monday.
As it chanced Mr. Pigott, Colonel Lewknor and Mr. Trupp
were the only magistrates present.
</p>
<p>
Ernie, who appeared with his head bandaged, admitted
his mistake.
</p>
<p>
"Went to pass the time o day with my brother," he said.
"And all he done was to lean out of the window and crash
the crockery down on the roof o me head.  Did upset me
a bit, I admit."
</p>
<p>
"He meant murder all right," was Alf's testimony,
sullenly given.  "He knows that."
</p>
<p>
Joe corroborated Ernie's statement.
</p>
<p>
He had been in the Saffrons on Saturday afternoon and
had seen Ernie coming down the hill from Old Town.  Having
a message to give him he had started to meet him.  Ernie
had gone up the steps of his brother's house; and as he did
so, Alf had leaned out of the upper window and thrown a
jug down on his brother.
</p>
<p>
Alf's solicitor cross-examined the engineer at some
length.
</p>
<p>
"What were you doing on the Saffrons?"
</p>
<p>
"Watching the football."
</p>
<p>
"You were watching the football; and yet you saw
Caspar coming down Church Street?"
</p>
<p>
"I did."
</p>
<p>
"I suggest that you did nothing of the sort; and that
you only appeared on the scene at the last moment."
</p>
<p>
"Well," retorted Joe, good-humouredly.  "A don't
blame you for that.  It's what you're paid to suggest."
</p>
<p>
A witness who was to have given evidence for Alf did
not appear; and the Bench agreed without retiring.  Neither
of the brothers had been up before the magistrates before
and both were let off with a caution, Ernie having to pay
costs.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Your</i> tongue's altogether too long, Alfred Caspar,"
said Mr. Pigott, the Chairman, and added—quite
unjudicially—"always was.  And <i>you're</i> altogether too free with your
fists, Ernest Caspar."
</p>
<p>
Ernie left the court rejoicing; for he knew he had
escaped lightly.  Outside he waited to thank his friend for
his support.
</p>
<p>
"Comin up along?" he coaxed.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, ma lad," retorted the engineer with the touch of
brutality which not seldom now marked his intercourse with
the other.  "You must face the missus alone.  Reck'n
A've done enough for one morning."
</p>
<p>
Ern went off down Saffrons Road in the direction of Old
Town, crest-fallen as is the man whose little cocoon of
self-defensive humbug has suddenly been cleft by a steel blade.
</p>
<p>
Joe marched away down Grove Road.  Alf caught him
up.  The little chauffeur was smiling that curds-and-whey
smile of his.
</p>
<p>
"Say, Burt!—you aren't half a liar, are you?" he
whispered.
</p>
<p>
Joe grinned genially.
</p>
<p>
"The Church can't have it all to herself," he said.
"Leave a few of the lies to the laity."
</p>
<p>
Ern trudged back from the Town Hall, across Saffrons
Croft, to the Moot, in unenviable mood; for he was afraid,
and he had cause.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was who standing in the door came stalking to
meet him, holding little Alice by the hand.
</p>
<p>
Ern slouched up with that admixture of bluff, lordly
insouciance, and aggrieved innocence that is the honoured
defence of dog and man alike on such occasions.
</p>
<p>
"You've done us," she said almost vengefully.
</p>
<p>
"What are I done then?" asked the accused, feigning
abrupt indignation.
</p>
<p>
Ruth dismissed the child, and turned on Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"Got us turn into the street—me and my babies," she
answered, splendidly indignant.  "A chap's been round
arter the house, while you was up before the beaks settlin
whether you were for Lewes Gaol or not.  Says Alf's let
it him a week from Saraday, and we got to go.  I wouldn't
let him in."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Ernie stubbornly, "don't you worry.  Alf's
got to give us notice first.  And he daren't do that."
</p>
<p>
Ruth was not to be appeased.
</p>
<p>
"Why daren't he, then?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you for why," answered Ernie.  "He's goin up
before the Watch Committee come Thursday to get his
licence for his blessed Touring Syndicate.  We've friends
on that Committee, good friends—Mr. Pigott, and the
Colonel, not to say Mr. Geddes; and Alf knaws it.  He
ain't goin to do anythink to annoy them just now.  Knaws
too much, Alf do."
</p>
<p>
Ruth was not convinced.
</p>
<p>
"We got no friends," she said sullenly.  "We shall
lose em all over this.  O course we shall, and I don't
blame em.  A fair disgrace on both of you, I call it.
You're lucky not to have to do a stretch.  And as to
Alf, they've sack him from sidesman over it, and he'll
never forgive us."
</p>
<p>
They were walking slowly back to the cottage, the man
hang-dog, the woman cold.
</p>
<p>
Outside the door she paused.
</p>
<p>
"All I know is this," she said.  "If you're out again
through your own fault I'm done with it, and I'll tell you
straight what I shall do, Ern."
</p>
<p>
She was very quiet.
</p>
<p>
"What then?"
</p>
<p>
"I shall leave you with your children and go away with
mine."  She stood with heaving bosom, immensely moved.
"I ca-a'nt keep the lot.  But I can keep one.  And you
know which one that'll be."
</p>
<p>
Ernie, the colour of dew, went indoors without a word.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The rumour that Alf had been dismissed from his
position as sidesman at St. Michael's, owing to the incident
in the Goffs, was not entirely true, but there was something
in it.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon had his faults, but there was no more
zealous guardian of the fair fame of the Church and all
things appertaining to her.
</p>
<p>
Alf's appearance before the magistrates was discussed
at the weekly conference of the staff at the Rectory.
</p>
<p>
Both Mr. Spink and Bobby Chislehurst were present.
The former stoutly defended his protégé, and the
Archdeacon heard him out.  Then he turned to Bobby.
</p>
<p>
"What d'you say, Chislehurst?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Bobby, in fact, could say little.
</p>
<p>
Ernie had no scruples whatever in suggesting what was
untrue to the magistrates, who when on the Bench at all
events were officials, and to be treated accordingly, but he
would never lie to a man who had won his heart.  He had,
therefore, in answer to the Cherub's request given an
unvarnished account of what had occurred.  Bobby now
repeated it reluctantly, but without modification.
</p>
<p>
"Exactly," said Mr. Spink.  "There's not a tittle of
evidence that Alfred really did say what he's accused of
saying.  And he denies it, point-blank."
</p>
<p>
"I think I'd better see him," said the Archdeacon.
</p>
<p>
Alf came, sore and sulking.
</p>
<p>
Mottled and sour of eye, he stood before the Archdeacon
who flicked the lid of his snuff-box, and asked whether he
had indeed made the remark attributed to him.
</p>
<p>
"I never said nothing of the sort," answered Alf
warmly, almost rudely.  "Is it likely?  me own sister-in-law
and all!  See here!" He produced his rent-book.
"I'm her landlord.  She's months behind.  See for yourself!
Any other man only me'd have turned her out weeks
ago.  But, of course, she takes advantage.  She would.
She's that sort.  I never said a word against her."
</p>
<p>
"And there is plenty you could say," chimed in Mr. Spink,
who had escorted his friend.
</p>
<p>
"Maybe there is," muttered Alf.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon made a grimace.  In the matter of sex
indeed if in no other, he was and always had been a genuine
aristocrat—sensitive, refined, fastidious.
</p>
<p>
"Two of them get soaking together in the <i>Star</i>,"
continued Alf.  "Then they start telling each other dirty
stories and quarrellin.  Ern believes it all and comes and
makes a fuss.  Mr. Pigott's chairman on the Bench.  Course
he lays it all on me—Mr. Pigott would.  Ern can't do no
wrong in his eyes—never could.  Won't listen to reason and
blames me along of him—because I'm a Churchman.  See,
he's never forgiven me leaving the Chapel, Mr. Pigott
hasn't; and that's the whole story."
</p>
<p>
It was a good card to play; and it did its work.
</p>
<p>
"It's a cleah case to my mind of more sinned against
than sinning," said the Archdeacon with a genuinely kind
smile.  "You had bad luck, Caspar—but a good friend."  He
shook hands with both young men.  "I wish you well
and offer you my sympathy.  I think you should go and have
a word of explanation with our friend, Mr. Pigott, though."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir," said Alf.  "I'm goin now.  I couldn't let
it rest there."
</p>
<p>
Alf went straight on to interview the erring chairman in
the little villa in Victoria Drive.
</p>
<p>
The latter, summing up his old pupil with shrewd blue
eye in which there was a hint of battle, refused to discuss
the case or his judgment.
</p>
<p>
"What's done is done," he said.  "The law's the law
and there's no goin back on it.  You were lucky to get off
so light; that's my notion of it."
</p>
<p>
Alf stood before him, hang-dog and resentful.
</p>
<p>
"He'll kill me one of these days," he muttered.  "Little
better than a bloody murderer."
</p>
<p>
There was a moment's pause, marked by a snort from
Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
Then the jolly, cosy man, with his trim white beard and
neat little paunch, rose and opened the window with some
ostentation.
</p>
<p>
"First time that word's ever crossed my threshold," he
said.  "And I've lived in this house ten year come
Michaelmas."  He turned with dignity on the offender.  "Is that
what they teach you in the Church of England, then, Alfred
Caspar?" he asked.  "It wasn't what we taught you in
the Wesleyan Chapel in which you was bred.  Never heard
the like of it for language in all me life—never!"  Before
everything else in life Mr. Pigott was a strong chapel-man;
and in his judgment Ern's weakness was as nothing to Alf's
apostasy.
</p>
<p>
Alf looked foolish and deprecatory.
</p>
<p>
"I didn't mean in it the swearin way," he said—"not as
Ernest would have meant it.  I never been in the Army
meself.  I only meant he'll be the end o me one of these
days.  Good as said he would in the <i>Star</i> Saturday."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott turned away to hide the twinkle in his eye.
He knew Alf well, and his weakness.
</p>
<p>
"He don't like you, I do believe," he admitted.  "And
he's a very funny fellow, Ern, when his hackle's up."
</p>
<p>
Alf's eyes blinked as they held the floor.
</p>
<p>
"And now," he said, "I suppose the Watch Committee'll
not grant my licence for the Road-Touring Syndicate when
it comes up afore em on Thursday.  And I'll be a ruined man."
</p>
<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised," answered Mr. Pigott, who
was an alderman and a great man on the Town Council.
</p>
<p>
Alf was furious.  He was so furious, indeed, that he did
a thing he had not done for years: he took his trouble to
his mother.
</p>
<p>
"It's a regular plot," he said, "that's what it is.  To
get my licence stopped and ruin me.  Raised the money;
ordered the buses; engaged the staff and all.  And then they
spring this on me!—It ain't Ernie.  I will say that for him.
I know who's at the bottom of it."
</p>
<p>
"Who then?" asked his mother, faintly interested.
</p>
<p>
"Her Ern keeps."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Caspar roused instantly.
</p>
<p>
"Isn't she married to him then?" she cried, peering
over her spectacles.
</p>
<p>
"Is she?" sneered Alf.  "That's all."
</p>
<p>
He leaned forward, his ugly face dreadful with a sneer.
</p>
<p>
"Do you know where she'd be if everyone had his rights?"
</p>
<p>
"Where then?"
</p>
<p>
"Lewes Gaol."
</p>
<p>
His message delivered, he sat back with a nod to watch
its effect.
</p>
<p>
"And she would be there too," continued Alf, "only
for me."
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" Mrs. Caspar asked.
</p>
<p>
"I mean," answered Alf, "as I keep her out of prison
by keepin me mouth shut."  He dropped his voice.  "And
that ain't all.  She's at it again ... Her home's a
knockin-shop....  All the young men....  The
police ought to interfere....  I shall tell the
Archdeacon....  A kept woman....  That chap Burt....
That's how Ern makes good....  She makes
the money he spends at the <i>Star</i>....  And your
grand-children brought up in that atmosphere!"  He struck the
table.  "But I'm her landlord all the same; and I'll make
her know it yet."
</p>
<p>
Anne Caspar was genuinely disturbed not for the sake
of Ruth, but for that of the children.
</p>
<p>
"You could never turn her out!" she said—"not
your own sister-in-law and four children!  Look so bad
and all—and you a sidesman too."
</p>
<p>
Alf snorted.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, couldn't I?" he said.  "You never know what a
man can do till he tries."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
That evening the Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor walked
over to the Manor-house to discuss Ern's latest misadventure.
They found Mr. Pigott there clearly on the same
errand; but the old Nonconformist rose to go with faintly
exaggerated dignity on seeing his would-be enemy.
</p>
<p>
"There's only one thing'll save him now," he announced
in his most dogmatic style.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked Mrs. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"H'a h'earthquake," the other answered.
</p>
<p>
When the Colonel and his wife left the Manor-house
half-an-hour later there were three people walking
abreast down the hill before them, just as there had been
on a previous occasion.  Now, as then, the centre of the three
was Ruth.  Now, as then, on her left was Joe.  But on her
right instead of Ern was little Alice.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel pointed to the three.
</p>
<p>
"I'll back Caspar all the way," said Mrs. Lewknor
firmly.
</p>
<p>
"Myself," replied the Colonel shrewdly, "I'll back the
winner."
</p>
<p>
Then he paused to read a placard which gave the latest
news of the Ulster campaign.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>
<h2>
PART II
<br>
TROUBLED DAWN
</h2>
<p><br><br></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
THE BETRAYAL
</h3>
<p>
The Ulster Campaign was moving forward now with
something of the shabby and theatrical pomp of a travelling
circus parading the outskirts of a sea-side town before a
performance.  A dromedary with an elongated upper lip,
draped in the dirty trappings of a pseudo-Oriental satrap,
led the procession, savage and sulking.  Behind the
dromedary came the mouldy elephant, the mangy bear, the fat
woman exposing herself in tights on a gilt-edged Roman
chariot, the sham cow-boys with gaudy cummerbunds, and
Cockney accents, on untamed bronchos hired from the local
livery stables, the horse that was alleged to have won the
Derby in a by-gone century, etc.  And the spectators gaped
on the pavement, uncertain whether to jeer or to applaud.
</p>
<p>
As the Campaign rolled on its way, the wiser Conservatives
shook their heads, openly maintaining that the
whole business was a direct abnegation of everything for
which their party had stood in history, while the Liberals
became increasingly restive: Mr. Geddes, uneasy at the
inaction of the Government, Mr. Geddes truculent to meet
the truculence of the enemy.  The only man who openly
rejoiced was Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
"The Tory Reds have lit such a candle by God's grace
in England as'll never be put out," he said to Ernie.
</p>
<p>
The engineer had always now a newspaper cutting in
his waistcoat pocket, and a quotation pat upon his lips.
</p>
<p>
"They're all shots for the locker in the only war that
matters," he told the Colonel.  "And they'll all coom in
handy one day.  A paste em into a lil book nights: <i>Tips
for Traitors; an ammunition magazine</i>, A call it."
</p>
<p>
For him Sir Edward Carson's famous confession of
faith, <i>I despise the Will of the People</i>—words Joe had inscribed
as motto on the cover of his ammunition magazine—gave the
key to the whole movement.  And he never met the Colonel
now but he discharged a broadside into the helpless body
of his victim.
</p>
<p>
It was not, however, till early in 1914, just when his
pursuit of Ruth was at the hottest, that he woke to the fact
that the Tories were tampering with the Army.  That
maddened Joe.
</p>
<p>
"If this goes on A shall go back to ma first love," he
told Ruth with a characteristic touch of impudence.
</p>
<p>
"And a good job too," she answered tartly.  "I don't
want you."
</p>
<p>
"And you can go back to your Ernie," continued the
engineer, glad to have got a rise.
</p>
<p>
"I shan't go back to him," retorted Ruth, "because I
never left him."
</p>
<p>
The statement was not wholly true: for if Ruth had
not left Ernie, since the affair of the Goffs she had
according to her promise turned her back on him.  When
on the first opportunity that offered she had announced his
fate to the offender, he had blinked, refused to understand,
argued, insisted, coaxed—to no purpose.
</p>
<p>
"You got to be a man afoor I marry you again," she
told him coldly.  "I'm no'hun of a no-man's woman."
</p>
<p>
Ernie at first refused to accept defeat.  He became
eloquent about his rights.
</p>
<p>
"They're nothing to my wrongs," Ruth answered
briefly; and turned a deaf ear to all his pleas.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter Ernie found himself glad to escape the home
haunted by the woman he still loved, who tantalised and
thwarted him.  That was why when Joe girded on his
armour afresh and went forth to fight the old enemy in the
new disguise, Ernie accompanied him.
</p>
<p>
The pair haunted Unionist meetings, Ernie quiescent,
the other aggressive to rowdiness.  Young Stanley Bessemere,
who had returned from Ireland (where he now spent
all his leisure caracoling on a war-horse at the distinguished
tail of the caracoling Captain Smith) to address a series
of gatherings in his constituency in justification of the
Ulster movement, and his own share in it, was the favoured
target for his darts.  Joe followed him round from the
East-end to Meads, and from Meads to Old Town, and even
pursued him into the country.  He acquired a well-earned
reputation as a heckler, and was starred as dangerous by
the Tory bloods.  Mark that man! the word went round.
</p>
<p>
Joe knew it, and was only provoked to increased
aggressiveness.
</p>
<p>
"Go on, ma lad!" he would roar from the back of the
hall.  "Yon's the road to revolution aw reet!"
</p>
<p>
There came a climax at a meeting in the Institute, Old
Town.  Joe at question time had proved himself unusually
bland and provocative.  The stewards had tried to put him
out; and there had been a rough and tumble in the course
of which somebody had hit the engineer a crack on the head
from behind with the handle of a motor-car.  Joe
dropped; and Ernie stood over him in the ensuing scuffle.
The news that there was trouble drew a little crowd.  Ruth,
on her evening marketings in Church Street, looked in.  She
found Joe sitting up against the wall, dazed; and Ernie
kneeling beside him and having words with Stanley
Bessemere, who was strolling towards the door.
</p>
<p>
"Brought his troubles on his own head," said the
young member casually.
</p>
<p>
"Hit a man from behind!" retorted Ernie, quiet but
rather white.  "English, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
"It was your own brother, then!" volunteered an
onlooker.
</p>
<p>
Joe rallied, rubbed his head, looked up, saw Ruth and
reassured her.
</p>
<p>
"A'm maself," he said.
</p>
<p>
He rose unsteadily on Ernie's arm.
</p>
<p>
"He must come home along of us," said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"Of course he must then," Ernie answered with the
asperity of the thwarted male.
</p>
<p>
The night-air revived the wounded man.  Arrived at
the cottage he sat in the kitchen, still a little stupid, but
amused with his adventure.
</p>
<p>
"They'd ha kicked me in stoomach when A was down
only for you, Ern," he said.  "That's the Gentlemen of
England's notion of politics, that is."
</p>
<p>
"You'd ha done the same by them, Joe, if you'd the
chance," answered Ern.
</p>
<p>
The other grinned.
</p>
<p>
"A would that, by Guy—and all for loov," he admitted.
</p>
<p>
Ruth brought him a hot drink.  He sipped it, one eye
still on his saviour.
</p>
<p>
"I owe this to you, Ern.  Here's to you!"
</p>
<p>
"Come to that, Joe, I owe you something," Ernie
answered.
</p>
<p>
"What's that then?" Joe sat as a man with a stiff
neck, screwing up his eye at the other.
</p>
<p>
Ern nodded significantly at Ruth's back.
</p>
<p>
"Why that little bit o tiddley you done for me afore the
beaks," he whispered.
</p>
<p>
"That's nowt," answered Joe sturdily.  "What was it
Saul said to Jonathan—<i>If a feller can't tiddle it a liddel bit
for his pal, what the hell use is he?</i>—Book o Judges."
</p>
<p>
Ruth in the background watched the two men.  It was
as though she were weighing them in the balance.  There
was a touch of masterful tenderness about Ern's handling
of his damaged friend that surprised and pleased her.
</p>
<p>
Joe made an effort to get up.
</p>
<p>
"A'd best be shiftin," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Never!" cried Ern, authoritatively.  "You'll bide the
night along o us.  She'll make you a bed on the couch here."
</p>
<p>
"Nay," said Ruth.  "You'll sleep in the bed along
o Ernie."
</p>
<p>
Joe eyed her.
</p>
<p>
"Where'll you sleep then?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"In the spare room," Ruth answered, winking at Ernie.
</p>
<p>
There was no spare room; but she made up a shake-down
for herself on the settle in the kitchen.  Ernie, after
packing away the visitor upstairs, came down to help
her.  It also gave him an opportunity to ventilate his
grievance.
</p>
<p>
"One thing.  It won't make much difference to me,"
he said.
</p>
<p>
"Your own fault," Ruth answered remorselessly.
"And you aren't the only one, though I know you think
you are.  Men do ... We'd be out in the street now, the
lot of us, only for Joe telling lies for you."
</p>
<p>
Next morning she took her visitor breakfast in bed and
kept him there till Mr. Trupp had come, who told Joe he
must not return to work for a week.
</p>
<p>
The engineer got up that afternoon and was sitting in
the kitchen still rather shaky, when Alf, who had not
fulfilled his threat and given Ruth notice, called for the rent.
</p>
<p>
Ruth greeted him with unusual friendliness.
</p>
<p>
"Come in, won't you?" she said—"while I get the money."
</p>
<p>
Alf, who in some respects was simple almost as Ernie,
entered the trap to find Joe, huddled in a chair and glowering
murder at him.  He tried to withdraw, but Ruth stood
between him and the door, twice his size, and with glittering
eyes.
</p>
<p>
"There's a friend of yours," she said.  "Saw him last
night, at the meeting, didn't you?—I thart you'd be glad
to meet him."
</p>
<p>
Alf quaked.
</p>
<p>
"Been in the wars then?" he said shakily.
</p>
<p>
"What d'you know about it?" rumbled Joe.
</p>
<p>
"I don't know nothin," answered Alf sharply, almost
shrilly.
</p>
<p>
Just then little Alice entered.  Alf took advantage of her
entrance to establish his line of retreat.  Once set in the door
with a clear run for the open his courage returned to him.
</p>
<p>
"And what may be your name?" he asked the child
with deliberate insolence.
</p>
<p>
"Alice Caspar," she answered, staring wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>
Alf sneered.
</p>
<p>
"That it ain't—I know," he said, and went out without
his rent, and laughing horribly.
</p>
<p>
Little Alice ran out again.
</p>
<p>
"What's he mean?" asked Joe.
</p>
<p>
Ruth regarded him with wary curiosity.
</p>
<p>
"Didn't Ern never tell you then?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Never!" said Joe.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was thoughtful.  That was nice of Ern—like
Ern—the gentleman in him coming out.
</p>
<p>
That night she softened to him.  He noticed it in a
flash and approached her—only to be repulsed abruptly.
</p>
<p>
"No," she said.  "I don't care about you no more.
You've lost me.  That's where it is."
</p>
<p>
"O, I beg pardon," answered Ernie, quivering.  "I
thart we was married."
</p>
<p>
"So we was one time o day, I believe," Ruth answered.
"And might be again yet.  Who knaws?"
</p>
<p>
He stood over her as she composed herself for the night
on the settle.
</p>
<p>
"How long's that Joe going to stop in my house?" he
asked.
</p>
<p>
"Just as long as I like," she answered coolly.
</p>
<p>
Next day when Joe came in for tea he found Ruth
sitting in the kitchen, nursing little Alice, who was crying
her heart out on her mother's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"They've been tormenting her at school," Ruth
explained.  "It's Alf."
</p>
<p>
"I'll lay it is," muttered Joe.  "Ern and me, we'll just
go round when he comes back from work."
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked frightened.
</p>
<p>
"Don't tell Ern for all's sake, Joe!" she whispered.
</p>
<p>
"Why not then?"
</p>
<p>
"He'd kill Alf."
</p>
<p>
Joe's face betrayed his scepticism.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you don't knaw Ern, when he's mad," Ruth
warned him.
</p>
<p>
An hour later Ernie came home.  He was still, suppressed,
as often now.  There was nobody in the kitchen but Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"Where's your Joe, then?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"He's left," Ruth answered.
</p>
<p>
Ernie relaxed ever so little.
</p>
<p>
"He might ha stopped to say good-bye," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
Ruth rose.
</p>
<p>
"I got something to tell you, Ern," she said.
</p>
<p>
He turned on her abruptly.
</p>
<p>
"It's little Alice.  They've been getting at her at
school—<i>that!</i>—you knaw."
</p>
<p>
Ernie was breathing hard.
</p>
<p>
"Who split?"
</p>
<p>
"Alf.  He told Mrs. Ticehurst—I see him; and she told
the lot."
</p>
<p>
Ern went out slowly, and slowly up the stairs in the dark
to the children's room.
</p>
<p>
A little voice called—"Daddy!"
</p>
<p>
"I'm comin, sweet-heart," he answered tenderly.
</p>
<p>
He felt his way to the child's bed, knelt beside it, and
struck a match.  A tear like a star twinkled on her cheek.  She
put out her little arms to him and clasped him round the neck.
</p>
<p>
"Daddy, you <i>are</i> my daddy, aren't you?" she sobbed,
her heart breaking in her voice.
</p>
<p>
He laid his cheek against hers.  Both were wet.
</p>
<p>
"Of course I am," he answered, the water floods sounding
in his throat.  "I'm your daddy; and you're my darling.
And if we got nobody else we got each other, ain't we?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth, in the dark at the foot of the stairs, heard, gave a
great gulp, and crept back to the kitchen.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
THE COLONEL FACES DEFEAT
</h3>
<p>
The Colonel, who throughout his life while making a great
show of radical opinions in the mess for the benefit of his
brother-officers had always voted quietly for the
Conservative party on the ground that they made upon the whole
less of a hash of Imperial affairs than their Liberal opponents
was profoundly troubled by the proceedings in Ulster.
</p>
<p>
"The beggars are undermining the <i>morale</i> of Ireland,"
he told Mr. Trupp.  "And only those who've been quartered
there know what that means."
</p>
<p>
"If you said they were undermining the foundations of
Society I'd agree," the other answered.  "Geddes says
they've poisoned the wells of civilisation, and he's about
right."
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian minister, indeed, usually so sane and
moderate, had been roused to unusual vehemence by the
general strike against the law engineered by the
Conservative leaders.
</p>
<p>
"It's a reckless gamble in anarchy with the country's
destiny at stake," he said.
</p>
<p>
"And financed by German Jews," added Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
As the Campaign developed and the success of the
Unionists in tampering with the Army became always more
apparent, the criticisms of the two men intensified.  They
hung like wolves upon the flank of the Colonel, pertinacious
in pursuit, remorseless in attack.
</p>
<p>
"You can't get away from the fact that the whole
Campaign is built on the power of the Unionists to corrupt
the officers of the Army," said the minister.  "Without
that the whole thing collapses."
</p>
<p>
"And so far," chimed in Joe, "A must say it looks as
if they were building on a sure foundation."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, outwardly gay, was inwardly miserable
that his beloved Service should be dragged in the mud.
</p>
<p>
"What can you say to them?" he groaned to Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"Why," said the old surgeon brusquely, "tell em to
tell their own rotten Government to govern or get out.  Let
em hang half a dozen politicians for treason, and shoot the
same number of soldiers for sedition—and the thing's
done."
</p>
<p>
And the bitterness of it was that it looked increasingly
as if the critics were right.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel came home one night from a rare visit to
London in black despair.
</p>
<p>
"The British officer never grows up," he complained to
his wife.  "He's a perfect baby."  His long legs writhed
themselves into knots, as he sucked at his pipe.  "Do you
remember that charming little feller Cherry Dugdale, who
commanded the Borderers at Umballa?"
</p>
<p>
"The shikari?—rather."
</p>
<p>
"He's joined the Ulster Volunteers as a private."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor chuckled.  She was a Covenanter sans
phrase, fierce almost as the Archdeacon and delighting in
the embarrassments of the Government.
</p>
<p>
"Just like him," she said.  "Little duck!"
</p>
<p>
Then came the crash.
</p>
<p>
The Commander-in-Chief in Ireland sent for General
Gough, commanding the 3rd Cavalry Brigade at the
Curragh, and asked him what his action would be in the
event of the Government giving him and his Brigade the
alternative of serving against Ulster or resigning.  Gough
forthwith called a conference of his officers, and seventy
out of seventy-five signified their intention to resign.
</p>
<p>
"We would rather not shoot Irishmen," they said.
</p>
<p>
On the evening after the news came through the Colonel
was walking down Terminus Road when he heard a
provocative voice behind him.
</p>
<p>
"What about it, Colonel?"
</p>
<p>
He turned to find Joe Burt at his heels.
</p>
<p>
"What about what?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"This mutiny of the officers at the Curragh."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel affected a gaiety he by no means felt.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what's your view?"
</p>
<p>
Joe was enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>
"Why, it's the finest example of Direct Action ever
seen in this coontry.  And it's been given by the Army
officers!—That's what gets me."
</p>
<p>
"What's Direct Action?" asked the Colonel.  The
phrase in those days was unknown outside industrial circles.
</p>
<p>
"A strike, and especially a strike for political purposes,"
answered Joe.  "General Gough and his officers have struck
to prevent Home Rule being placed on the Statute Book.
What if a Trade Union had tried to hold up the coontry
same road?  It's what A've always said," the engineer
continued, joyously aggressive.  "The officers of the British
Army aren't to be trusted except when their own party's
in power."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked on to the club.
</p>
<p>
There he found young Stanley Bessemere, just back
from Ireland, sitting in a halo of cigar-smoke, the hero of an
amused and admiring circle, recording his latest military
exploits.
</p>
<p>
"We've got the swine beat," he was saying confidently
between puffs.  "The Army won't fight.  And the
Government can do nothing."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned a vengeful eye upon him.
</p>
<p>
"Young man," he said, "are you aware that Labour's
watching you?  Labour's learning from you?"
</p>
<p>
"Labour be damned!" retorted the other with jovial
brutality.  "We'll deal with Labour all right when we've
got this lot of traitors out of office."
</p>
<p>
"Traitors!" called Mr. Trupp, harshly from his chair.
"You talk of traitors!—you Tories!—I voted for you at
the last General Election for the first time in my life on the
sole ground of national defence.  D'you think I or any
self-respecting man would have done so if we'd known the
jackanape tricks you'd be up to?"
</p>
<p>
The two elderly men retired in dudgeon to the card-room.
</p>
<p>
"There's only one thing the matter with Ireland,"
grumbled the old surgeon.  "And its always been the
same thing."
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"The English politician," replied the other—"Ireland's
curse."
</p>
<p>
Hard on the heels of the Curragh affair came the landing
of arms from Krupp's, with the connivance, if not with the
secret co-operation of the German Government, at Larne
under the cover of the rebel Army, mobilised for the purpose.
The Government wept a few patient tears over the outrage
and did nothing.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was irritated; Mr. Trupp almost vituperative.
</p>
<p>
"Geddes may say what he likes," remarked the former.
"But I can't acquit the Government.  They're encouraging
the beggars to play it up."
</p>
<p>
"Acquit them!" fulminated the old surgeon.  "I'd
impeach them on the spot.  The law in abeyance!  British
ports seized under the guns of the British fleet!  Gangs of
terrorists patrolling the roads and openly boasting they'll
assassinate any officer of the Crown who does his duty;
and the Episcopalian Church blessing the lot!  And the
Government does nothing.  It's a national disgrace!"
</p>
<p>
"It's all very well, Mr. Trupp," said Mr. Glynde, the
senior member for the Borough, who was present.  "But
Ulster has a case, and we must consider it."
</p>
<p>
"Of course Ulster has a case," the other answered
sharply.  "Nobody but a fool denies it.  I'm attacking
the Government, not Ulster.  Let them restore law and
order in Ireland.  That's their first job.  When they've
done that it'll be time enough to consider Ulster's grievances.
Where's all this going to lead us?"
</p>
<p>
"Hell," said the Colonel gloomily.
</p>
<p>
He was, indeed, more miserable than he had ever been
in his life.
</p>
<p>
Other old Service men he met, who loathed the Government,
looked on with amused or spiteful complacency at
the part the Army was playing in the huge conspiracy
against the Crown.  The Colonel saw nothing but the shame
of it, its possible consequences, and effect on opinion,
domestic, imperial and European.
</p>
<p>
He walked about as one in a maze: he could not understand.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Geddes came to see him.
</p>
<p>
The tall minister was very grave; and there was no
question what he came about—the Army Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel looked out of the window and twisted his
long legs as he heard the other out.
</p>
<p>
"Dear little Gough-y!" he murmured at the end.
"The straightest thing that walks the earth."
</p>
<p>
He felt curiously helpless, as he had felt throughout the
Campaign; unable to meet his adversaries except by the
evasion and casuistical tricks his spirit loathed.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Geddes rose.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Colonel," he said.  "I see no alternative but to
resign my membership of the League.  It's perfectly clear
that if your scheme goes through it must be run by officers
at the War Office.  And I'm afraid I must add that it seems
equally clear now that it will be run for political purposes
by men who put their party before their country."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned slowly round.
</p>
<p>
"You've very kindly lent us St. Andrew's Hall for a
meeting of the League next Friday.  Do you cancel that?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Certainly not, Colonel," answered the minister.  "By
all means hold your meeting.  I shall be present, and I
shall speak." ...
</p>
<p>
It was not a happy meeting at St. Andrew's Hall, but it
was a crowded one: for the vultures had sniffed the battle
from afar.  The Liberals came in force, headed by
Mr. Pigott; while Joe Burt led his wolves from the East-end.
Ernie was there, very quiet now as always, with Ruth; and
Bobby Chislehurst, seeing them, took his seat alongside.
</p>
<p>
Fighting with his back to the wall, and well aware of
it, the Colonel was at his very best: witty, persuasive,
reasonable.  What the National Service League advocated
was not aggression in any shape, but insurance.
</p>
<p>
He sat down amid considerable and well-earned applause.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Geddes rose.
</p>
<p>
He had joined the League after Agadir, he said, after
much perturbation and questioning of spirit, because he
had been reluctantly convinced at last that the German
menace was a reality.  Yet what was the position to-day?
The Conservative Party, which had preached this menace
for years, had been devoting the whole of its energies now
for some time past to fomenting a civil war in Ireland.
They had gone so far as to arm a huge force that was in
open rebellion against the Crown with rifles and machine-guns
from the very country which they affirmed was about
to attack us.  And more remarkable still certain Generals
at the War Office—he wouldn't mention names—
</p>
<p>
"Why not?" shouted Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
It was not expedient; but he had in his pocket a
letter from Mr. Redmond giving the name of the General
who was primarily responsible for the sedition among the
officers of the Army—a very highly placed officer indeed.
</p>
<p>
"Shame!" cried someone.
</p>
<p>
He thought so too.  And this General, who was in the
somewhat anomalous position of being both technical military
adviser to the rebel army in Ulster and the trusted servant
of the Government at the War Office, was a man who for
years past, so he understood, had preached the doctrine that
war with Germany was inevitable, and had been for many
years largely responsible for the preparation of our forces
against attack from that quarter.  To suggest that this officer
and his colleagues were traitors was downright silly.  What,
then, was the only deduction a reasonable man could draw?
The minister paused: Why, that the German peril was not
a reality.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion was greeted with a howl of triumph from
the wolves at the back.
</p>
<p>
"Hear! hear!" roared Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt had jumped up.
</p>
<p>
"A'll tell you the whole truth about the German Bogey!"
he bawled.  "It's a put-up game by the militarists to force
conscription on the coontry for their own purposes.  Now
you've got it straight!"
</p>
<p>
As he sat down amid tumultuous applause at one end
of the hall a figure on the platform bobbed up as it were
automatically.  It was Alf.
</p>
<p>
"Am I not right in thinking that the gentleman at the
back of the hall is about to pay a visit to Germany?" he
asked urbanely.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, you are!" shouted Joe.  "And A wish all the
workin-men in England were comin too.  That'd put the
lid on the nonsense pretty sharp."
</p>
<p>
Then ensued something of a scene; the hub-bub pierced
by Alf's shrill scream,
</p>
<p>
"<i>Who's payin for your visit?</i>"
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon, a most capable chairman, restored
order; and Mr. Geddes concluded his speech on a note of
quiet strength.  When he finally sat down man after man
got up and announced his intention of resigning his
membership of the League.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Outside the hall the Colonel stood out of the moon in
the shadow of one of those trees which make the streets of
Beachbourne singular and lovely at all times of the year.
His work of the last six years had been undone, and it was
clear that he knew it.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, emerging from the hall, looked across at the forlorn
old man standing like a dilapidated pillar amid the drift
of the dissipating crowd.  She had herself no understanding
of the rights and wrongs of the controversy to which she had
just listened; her sympathies were not enlisted by either
side.  Only the human element, and the clash of personalities
which had made itself apparent at the meeting, had
interested her.  But she realised that the tall figure across
the road was the vanquished in the conflict; and her heart
went out to him.
</p>
<p>
"They aren't worth the worrit he takes over them,"
she said discontentedly.  "Let them have their war if
they want it, I says.  And when they've got it let those
join in as likes it, and those as don't stay out.  That's what
I say....  A nice man like that, too—so gentle with
it....  Ought to be ashamed of emselves; some of em."
</p>
<p>
Then she saw Mr. Chislehurst cross the road to his
cousin, and she was comforted.
</p>
<p>
"He'll walk home with him.—Come on, Ernie."
</p>
<p>
It was striking ten o'clock.  Ruth, who was in a hurry
to get back to her babes, left in the charge of a neighbour,
walked a-head.  Ernie, on the other hand, wished to
saunter, enjoying the delicious freshness of the spring night.
</p>
<p>
"Steady on then!" he said.  "That's the Archdeacon
in front, and Mr. Trupp and all."
</p>
<p>
"I knaw that then," replied Ruth with the asperity she
kept for Ernie alone.
</p>
<p>
"Well, you don't want to catch them up."
</p>
<p>
They entered Saffrons Croft, which lay black or
silver-blanched before them, peopled now only with tall trees.
The groups of elms, thickening with blossoms, gathered the
stars to their bosoms, and laid their shadows like patterns
along the smooth sward.  Beyond the threadbare tapestry
of trees rose the solid earth-work of the Downs, upholding
the brilliant night, encircling them as in a cup, and keeping
off the hostile world.  Ernie felt their strength, their
friendship, the immense and unfailing comfort of them.  A
great quiet was everywhere, brooding, blessed.  The earth
lay still as the happy dead, caressed by the moon.  But
behind the stillness the thrust and stir and aspiration of
new life quickening in the darkness, seeking expression,
made itself manifest.  Ernie was deliciously aware of that
secret urge.  He opened his senses to the rumour of it, and
filled his being with the breath of this mysterious renaissance.
</p>
<p>
He stopped and sniffed.
</p>
<p>
"It's coming," he said.  "I can smell it."
</p>
<p>
"It's come more like," answered Ruth.  "The lilacs
are out in the Manor-garden, and the brown birds singing
in the ellums fit to choke theirsalves."
</p>
<p>
They walked on slowly across the turf.  The lights of
the Manor-house twinkled at them friendly across the
ha-ha.  Ernie's heart, which had been hardening of late to
meet Ruth's hardness, thawed at the touch of spring.  The
doors of his being opened and his love leapt forth in billows
to surround her.  The woman in front paused as if responding
to that profound sub-conscious appeal.  Ern did not
hurry his pace; but she stayed for him in a pool of darkness
made by the elms.  Quietly he came up alongside.
</p>
<p>
"Ruth," he began, shy and stealthy as a boy-lover.
</p>
<p>
She did not answer him, but the moon lay on her face,
firm-set.
</p>
<p>
"Anything for me to-night?"
</p>
<p>
He came in upon her with a quiet movement as of wings.
She elbowed him off fiercely.
</p>
<p>
"A-done!" she said.  "You're not half-way through
yet—nor near it."
</p>
<p>
He pleaded, coaxing.
</p>
<p>
"I am a man, Ruth."
</p>
<p>
She was adamant.
</p>
<p>
"It's just what you are not," she retorted.  He knew
she was breathing deep; he did not know how near to
tears she was.  "You was one time o day—and you might
be yet.—You got to work your ticket, my lad."
</p>
<p>
He drew back.
</p>
<p>
She walked on swiftly now, passing out of Saffrons
Croft into the road.  He followed at some distance down the
hill past the Greys to the <i>Star</i> corner.  A man standing
there pointed.  He turned round to see Joe pounding after
him.
</p>
<p>
"The tickets and badges coom to-night," the engineer
explained.  "A meant to have given you yours, as A did
Mr. Geddes, at the meeting.  But you got away.  Good
night!  Friday!  Three o'clock sharp!  Don't forget."
</p>
<p>
Ruth had turned and was coming swiftly back towards them.
</p>
<p>
"Ain't you coming along then, Joe?" she called after him.
</p>
<p>
"Not to-night, thank-you, Ruth.  A got to square up
afore we go."
</p>
<p>
"I am disappointed," said Ruth disconsolately, and
turned away down Borough Lane.
</p>
<p>
Ernie came up beside her quietly.
</p>
<p>
"That night!" he said.  "Almost a pity you didn't
stay where you was in bed and let Joe take my place
alongside you."
</p>
<p>
"Hap it's what I've thart myself times," Ruth answered
sentimentally.
</p>
<p>
"Only thing," continued Ernie in that same strangely
quiet voice, "Joe wouldn't do it.  D'is no fault of his'n.
He is a man Joe is; even if so be you're no'hun of a woman."
</p>
<p>
The two turned into the house that once had been their
home.

CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
THE PILGRIMS
</h3>
<p>
Spring comes to Beachbourne as it comes to no other city
of earth, however fair; say those of her children who after
long sojourning in other lands come home in the evenings of
their days to sleep.
</p>
<p>
The many-treed town that lies between the swell of
the hills and the foam and sparkle of the sea sluicing
deliciously the roan length of Pevensey Bay unveils her
rounded bosom in the dawn of the year to the kind clear
gaze of heaven and of those who to-day pass and repass
along its windy ways.  Birds thrill and twitter in her
streets.  There earlier than elsewhere the arabis calls the
bee, and the hedge-sparrow raises his thin sweet pipe to bid
the hearts of men lift up: for winter is passed.  Chestnut
and laburnum unfold a myriad lovely bannerets on slopes
peopled with gardens and gay with crocuses and the laughter
of children.  The elms in Saffrons Croft, the beeches in
Paradise, stir in their sleep and wrap themselves about
in dreamy raiment of mauve and emerald.  The air is like
white wine, the sky of diamonds; and the sea-winds come
blowing over banks of tamarisk to purge and exhilarate.
</p>
<p>
On the afternoon of such a day of such a spring in
May, 1914, at Beachbourne station a little group waited
outside the barrier that led to the departure platform.
</p>
<p>
The group consisted of Joe Burt, Ernie, and Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was peeping through the bars on to the platform,
at the far end of which was a solitary figure, waiting clearly,
he too, for the Lewes train, and very smart in a new blue
coat with a velvet collar.
</p>
<p>
"It's Alf," she whispered, keen and mischievous to Joe,
"Ain't arf smart and all."
</p>
<p>
Joe peered with her.
</p>
<p>
"He's the proper little Fat," said the engineer.
"I'll get Will Dyson draw a special cartoon of him for the
<i>Leader</i>."
</p>
<p>
Ruth preened an imaginary moustache in mockery of
her brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
"I'm the Managing Director of Caspar's Touring Syndicate,
I am, and don't you forget it!" she said with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
"Where's he off to now?"
</p>
<p>
"Brighton, I believe, with the Colonel.  Some meeting
of the League," replied Ernie dully.
</p>
<p>
Just then Mr. Geddes joined them, and the four moved
on to the platform.
</p>
<p>
The train came in and Alf disappeared into it.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the Colonel passed the barrier.  He
marked the little group on the platform and at once
approached them.
</p>
<p>
Something unusual about the men struck him at once.
All three had about them the generally degagé air of those
on holiday bent.  The minister wore a cap instead of
the habitual wide-awake; and carried a rucksack on his
back.  Joe swung a parcel by a string, and Ernie had an
old kit-bag slung across his shoulder.  Rucksack, parcel,
and kit-bag were all distinguished by a red label.  The
Colonel stalked the party from the rear and with manifold
contortions of a giraffe-like neck contrived to read on the
labels printed in large black letters, ADULT SCHOOL
PEACE PARTY.  Then he speared the engineer under the
fifth rib with the point of his stick.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what y'up to now?" he asked sepulchrally.
</p>
<p>
"Just off to Berlin, Colonel," cried the other with
aggressive cheerfullness, "Mr. Geddes and I and this young
gentleman"—thrusting the reluctant Ernie forward—"one o
your soldiers, who knows better now."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel began to shake hands all round with elaborate
solemnity.
</p>
<p>
"Returning to your spiritual home while there is yet time,
Mr. Geddes," he said gravely.  "Very wise, I think.  You'll
be happier there than in our militarist land, you pacifist
gentlemen."
</p>
<p>
The minister, who was in the best of spirits, laughed.
The two men had not met since the affair of St. Andrew's
Hall: and each was relieved at the open and friendly
attitude of the other.
</p>
<p>
"Cheer up, Colonel," he said.  "It's only a ten-days'
trip."  They moved towards the train and Ernie got in.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Geddes was telling the Colonel something of the origin
and aims of the Adult School Union in general and of the
Peace Party in particular.
</p>
<p>
"How many of you are going?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Round about a hundred," his informant answered—"working
men and women mostly, from every county
in England.  Most trades will be represented."  They would
be billeted in Hamburg and Berlin on people of their own
class and their own ideals.  And next year their visit
would be returned in strength by their hosts of this year.
</p>
<p>
"Interesting," said the Colonel.  "But may I ask one
question?—What good do you think you'll do?"
</p>
<p>
"We hope it will do ourselves some good anyhow,"
Joe answered in fine fighting mood.  "Get to know each
other.  Draw the two peoples together.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nation to nation, land to land.</i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
"Stand oop on the seat, Ernie, and sing em your little
Red-Flag piece.—He sings that nice he do.—And I'll
give you a bit of chocolate."
</p>
<p>
Ernie did not respond and the Colonel came to his rescue.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I wish you luck," he sighed.  "I wish all
well-meaning idealists luck.  But the facts of life are hard;
and the idealists usually break their teeth on them.—Now I
must join my colleague."
</p>
<p>
He moved on, catching up Ruth who had prowled along
the platform to see if Alf was tucked safely away.  The
Colonel had not seen his companion since her husband had
been up before the Bench.
</p>
<p>
"Well, how's he getting on?" he asked; and turned
shrewdly to Ruth.  "Have you been doing him down
at home?"  Something suppressed about Ernie had struck
him.
</p>
<p>
Ruth dropped her eyelids suddenly.  For a moment
she was silent.  Then she flashed up at him swift brown
eyes in which the lovely lights danced mischievously.
</p>
<p>
"See I've hung him on the nail," she murmured warily;
and nodded her head with the fierce determination of a child.
"And I shan't take him off yet a bit.  He's got to learn,
Ern has."  She was in delicious mood, sportive, sprightly,
as a young hunter mare turned out into May pastures
after a hard season.
</p>
<p>
They had come to Alf's carriage.  He had taken his
seat in a corner and pretended not to see them.  Ruth tapped
sharply at the window just opposite his face.
</p>
<p>
"Hullo, Alf!" she called and fled.
</p>
<p>
The little chauffeur rose and followed her swift and
retreating figure down the platform.  Far down the train
Joe who was leaning out of a window exchanged words
with her as she came up.
</p>
<p>
"I don't like it, sir," Alf said, low.  "Dirty business I
call it.  Somebody ought to interfere if pore old Ern won't."
</p>
<p>
Joe now looked along the train at him with a scowl.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you!" came the engineer's scolding voice, loud
yet low.  "Dirty tyke!  Drop it!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, between you she ought to be well looked after,"
muttered the Colonel getting into the carriage.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
A fortnight later the Colonel was being driven home
by Alf from a meeting of the League at Battle.
Mrs. Lewknor, whose hostel was thriving now, had stood him
the drive and accompanied him.  It was a perfect evening
as they slid along over Willingdon Levels and entered the
outskirts of the town.  Opposite the Recreation Ground
Alf slowed down and, slewing round, pointed.
</p>
<p>
On a platform a man, bareheaded beneath the sky, was
addressing a larger crowd than usually gathered at that
spot on Saturday evenings.
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" asked Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
"The German party back," answered Alf.  "That's
Burt speaking, and Mr. Geddes alongside him."
</p>
<p>
The engineer's voice, brazen from much bawling, and
yet sounding strangely small and unreal under the immense
arch of heaven, came to them across the open.
</p>
<p>
"We've ate with em; we've lived with em; we've talked
with em; and we can speak for em.  I tell you <i>there
can't be war and there won't be war with such a people</i>.  It'd
be the crime of Cain.  Brothers we are; and brothers
we remain.  And not all the politicians and profiteers
and soldiers can make us other."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor got down and joined the
crowd.  As they did so the engineer, who had finished
his harangue, was moving a resolution: That this
meeting believes in the Brotherhood of Man and wishes
well to Germany.
</p>
<p>
"I second that," said the Colonel from the rear of the
crowd.
</p>
<p>
Just then Alf, who had left his car and followed the
Colonel, put a question.
</p>
<p>
"Did not Lord Roberts say in 1912 at Manchester that
Germany would strike when her hour struck?"
</p>
<p>
The man on the platform was so furious that he did not
even rise from his chair to reply.
</p>
<p>
"Yes he did!" he shouted.  "And he'd no business to!
Direct provocation it was."
</p>
<p>
"Will not Germany's hour have struck when the Kiel
Canal is open to Dreadnoughts?" continued the inquisitor
smoothly.  "And is it not the fact that the Canal is to
be opened for this purpose in the next few days?"
</p>
<p>
These questions were greeted with booings mingled
with cheers.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Geddes was rising to reply when Joe Burt leapt
to his feet, roused and roaring.
</p>
<p>
He said men had the choice between two masters—Fear
or Faith?—Which were we for?—Were we the heirs
of Eternity, the children of the Future, or the slaves and
victims of the Past?
</p>
<p>
"For maself A've made ma choice.  A'm not a Christian
in the ordinary sense: A don't attend Church or Chapel,
like soom folk.  But A believe we're all members one of
another, and that the one prayer which matters—if said from
the heart of men who believe in it and work for it—is <i>Our
Father</i>: the Father of Jew and Gentile, English and German.
And ma recent visit to Germany has confirmed me in ma
faith in the people, although A couldna say as much for
their rulers.  Look about you!  What do you see?—The sons
and daughters of God rotting away from tuberculosis in
every slum in Christendom, and the money and labour that
should go to redeeming them spent on altar-cloths and
armaments.  Altar-cloths and armaments!  Do your rulers
never turn their thoughts and eyes to Calvary?  There
are plenty of em in your midst and plenty to see on em
if you want to."
</p>
<p>
The engineer sat down.
</p>
<p>
"Muck!" said Mrs. Lewknor in her husband's ear.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not sure," replied the Colonel who had listened
attentively; but he didn't wholely like it.  Joe had always
been frothy; but of old beneath the froth there had been
sound liquor.  Now somehow the Colonel saw the froth but
missed the liquor.  To his subtle and critical mind it seemed
that the speaker's fury was neither entirely simulated
nor entirely real.  Habit was as much the motive of it
as passion.  It seemed to him the expression of an emotion
once entirely genuine and now only partly so.  An alloy
had corrupted the once pure metal.  He saw as clearly
as a woman that Joe was no longer living simply for one
purpose.  <i>Turgid</i> his wife had once called the engineer.
For the first time the Colonel realised the aptness of the
epithet.
</p>
<p>
Then he noticed Ruth on the fringe of the crowd.  He
was surprised: for it was a long march from Old Town,
and neither Ernie nor the children were with her.
</p>
<p>
"Come to be converted by the apostles of pacifism,
Mrs. Caspar?" he chaffed.
</p>
<p>
"No, sir," answered Ruth simply, her eyes on the
platform.  "I just come along to hear Joe.  That's why I
come."  Her face lighted suddenly, "There he is!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
The engineer had jumped down from the platform
and was making straight for her.  Ruth joined him; and
the two went off together, rubbing shoulders.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel strolled back towards the car: he was
thoughtful, even grave.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor met him with a little smile.
</p>
<p>
"It's all right, Jocko," she told him.  "She's only
playing with the man."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"She's put up the shutters, and said she's out—to her
own husband.  It's a dangerous game."
</p>
<p>
"Trust Ruth," replied the other.  "She knows her man."
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps," retorted the Colonel.  "Does she know herself?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
RED IN THE MORNING
</h3>
<p>
Joe Burt's rhetoric might not affect the Colonel greatly;
but the impressions of Mr. Geddes, conveyed to him quietly
a few days later in friendly conversation, were a different
matter.
</p>
<p>
The Presbyterian minister was a scholar, broad-minded,
open, honest.  He had moreover finished his
education at Berlin University, and had, as the Colonel
knew, ever since his student days maintained touch with his
German friends.  Mr. Geddes had come home convinced
that Germany was not seeking a quarrel.
</p>
<p>
"Hamburg stands to lose by war," he told the Colonel,
"And Hamburg knows it."
</p>
<p>
"What about Berlin?" the other asked.
</p>
<p>
"Berlin's militarist," the other admitted.  "And Berlin's
watching Ulster as a cat watches a mouse—you find that
everywhere; professors, soldiers, men in the street, even
my old host, Papa Schumacher, the carpenter, was agog
about it.—Was Ulster in Shetland?—Was the Ulster Army
black?—Would it attack England?—Well, our War Office
must know all about the stir there.  And that makes me
increasingly confident that something's happened to
eliminate whatever German menace there may ever have been."
</p>
<p>
"Exactly what Trupp was saying the other day,"
the Colonel commented.  "Something's happened.  You and
I don't know what.  You and I never do.  Bonar Law and
the rest of em wouldn't be working up a Civil War on this
scale unless they were certain Germany was muzzled; and
what's more the Government wouldn't let em.  The
politicians may be fools, but they aren't lunatics."
</p>
<p>
A few evenings after this talk as the Colonel sat after
supper in the loggia with his wife, overlooking the sea
wandering white beneath the moon, he ruminated between
puffs upon the political situation, domestic and
international, with a growing sense of confidence at his heart.
Indeed there was much to confirm his hopes.
</p>
<p>
The year had started with Lloyd George's famous
pronouncement that the relations between Germany and
England had never been brighter.  Then again there was
the point Trupp had made: the astonishing attitude
of the Unionist leaders, and the still more astonishing
tolerance of the Government.  Lastly, and far more
significant from the old soldier's point of view, there was
the action of Mr. Geddes's mystery-man who was no mystery-man
at all.  Everybody on the outermost edge of affairs
knew the name of the General in question.  Every porter
at the military clubs could tell you who he was.  Asquith
had never made any bones about it.  Redmond and Dillon
had named him to Mr. Geddes.  Yet if anybody could
gauge the military situation on the Continent it was surely
the man who, as Mr. Geddes had truly pointed out, had
specialized in co-ordinating our Expeditionary Force with
the Armies of France in the case of an attack by Germany.
There he was sitting at the War Office, as he had sat for
years past, in touch with the English Cabinet, <i>lié</i> with
the French General Staff, his ear at the telephone listening
to every rumour in every camp in Europe, and primed
by a Secret Service so able that it had doped the public
at home and every chancellery abroad to believe that
it was the last word in official stupidity.  This was the
man who had thrown in his lot with the gang of speculating
politicians who had embarked upon the campaign that
had so undermined discipline in the commissioned ranks
of the Army that for the first time in history a British
Government could no longer trust its officers to do their
duty without question.
</p>
<p>
Now no one could say this man was hot-headed;
nobody could say he was a fool.  Moreover he was a
distinguished soldier and to call his patriotism in question
was simply ridiculous, as even Geddes admitted.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel had throughout steadfastly refused to discuss
with friend or foe the ethics of this officer's attitude, and
its effect on the reputation of the Army.  But of one thing
he was certain.  No man in that officer's position of trust
and responsibility would gamble with the destinies of his
country—a gamble that might involve hundreds and
thousands of innocent lives.  His action might be
reprehensible—many people did not hesitate to describe it in
plainer terms; but he would never have taken it in view
of its inevitable reaction on military and political opinion
on the Continent unless he had been certain that the German
attack, which he of all men had preached for so long as
inevitable, would not mature or would not mature as yet.
</p>
<p>
What then was the only possible inference?
</p>
<p>
"Something had happened."
</p>
<p>
The words his mind had been repeating uttered
themselves aloud.
</p>
<p>
"What's that, my Jocko?" asked Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel stretched his long legs, took his pipe out
of his mouth, and sighed.
</p>
<p>
"If nothing has happened by Christmas 1915 I shall
resign the secretaryship of the League and return with
joy to the garden and the history of the regiment."  He
rose in the brilliant dusk like a spectre.  "Come on, my
lass!" he said.  "I would a plan unfold."
</p>
<p>
She took his arm and they strolled across the lawn
past the hostel towards the solid darkness of the Downs
which enfolded them.
</p>
<p>
The long white house stood still and solitary in the
great coombe that brimmed with darkness and was crowned
with multitudinous stars.  Washed by the moon, and
warm with a suggestion of human busyness, the hostel
seemed to be stirring in a happy sleep, as though conscious
of the good work it was doing.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor paused to look at it, a sense of comfort at
her heart.
</p>
<p>
The children's beds out on the balcony could be seen;
and the nurses moving in the rooms behind.  Groups of
parents, down from London for the week-end, strolled the
lawn.  A few older patients still lounged in deck-chairs
on the terrace, while from within the house came the sound
of laughter and someone playing rag-time.  The little
lady regarded the work of her hands not without a just sense
of satisfaction.  The hostel was booming.  It was
well-established now and had long justified itself.  She was doing
good work and earning honest money.  This year she would
not only pay for the grandson's schooling, but she hoped
at Christmas to make a start in reducing the mortgage.
</p>
<p>
"Well," she said, "what about it now, doubting Thomas?"
</p>
<p>
"Not so bad for a beginning," admitted the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Who's going to send Toby to Eton?" asked the lady,
cruelly triumphant.  "And how?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, I am," replied the Colonel brightly—"out of
my pension of five bob a week minus income tax."
</p>
<p>
Hugging each other's arms, they climbed the bank to the
vegetable garden, which six years before had been turned
up by the plough from the turf which may have known
the tread of Caesar's legionaries.  The raw oblong which had
then patched the green with a lovely mauve was already
peopled with trees and bushes, and rank with green stuff.
The Colonel paused and sniffed.
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Simpkins coming on ... I long to be back
among my cabbages ... I bet if I took these Orange
Pippins in hand myself I'd win first prize at the East Sussex
Show....  That duffer, old Lingfield—He's no good."
</p>
<p>
They turned off into the yard where Mrs. Lewknor
was erecting a garage, now nearly finished.  The Colonel
paused and stared up at it.
</p>
<p>
"My dear," he said, "I've got an idea.  We'll dig the
Caspars out of that hole in Old Town and put them in the
rooms above the garage.  I'll take him on as gardener and
odd-job man.  He's a first-rate rough gardener.  He was
showing me and Bobby his allotment only the other day.
And as you know, the solitary ambition of my old age has
been to have an old Hammer-man about me."
</p>
<p>
"And mine for you, my Jocko," mused Mrs. Lewknor,
far more wary than her impulsive husband.  "There are
only three rooms though, and she's got four children already
and is still only thirty or so."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel rattled on, undismayed.
</p>
<p>
"He'll be half a mile from the nearest pub here," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Mrs. Lewknor—"and further from the
clutches of that Burt man, who's twice as bad as any pub."
</p>
<p>
"Ha, ha!" jeered the Colonel.  "So you're coming
round to my way of thinking at last, are you?"
</p>
<p>
Next evening, the Colonel, eager always as a youth to
consummate his purpose, bicycled with his wife through
Paradise to Old Town.
</p>
<p>
At the corner opposite the Rectory they met Alf Caspar,
who was clearly in high feather.  The Colonel dismounted
for a word with the convener of the League.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Caspar," he said.  "So you've got your
licence from the Watch Committee, I hear."
</p>
<p>
Alf purred.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir.  All O.K.—down to the men that'll blow the
horn to give em a bit o music."
</p>
<p>
"When do you start?"
</p>
<p>
"Bank Holiday, sir.  I was just coming up to tell
mother we were through.  Last char-a-banc came this
afternoon—smart as paint."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel and Mrs. Lewknor walked on towards
Church Street.  At Billing's Corner, waiting for the bus,
was Edward Caspar.  He was peering at a huge placard
advertising expeditions by Caspar's Road-touring
Syndicate, to start on August 3rd.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, mischievous as a child, must cross the road
to his old Trinity compeer.
</p>
<p>
"Your boy's getting on, Mr. Caspar," he observed quietly.
</p>
<p>
The old man made a clucking like a disturbed hen.
</p>
<p>
"Dreadful," he said.  "Dreadful."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor laid two fingers on his arm.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Caspar," she said.
</p>
<p>
He glanced down at her like a startled elephant.  Then
he seemed to thrill as though a wind of the spirit was
blowing through him.  The roses of a forgotten youth bloomed
for a moment in his mottled cheeks.  An incredible delicacy
and tenderness inspired the face of this flabby old man.
</p>
<p>
"Miss Solomons!" he said, and lifting her little hand
kissed it.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel withdrew discreetly; and in a moment
his wife joined him, the lights dancing in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Pretty stiff!" grinned the Colonel—"in the public
street and all."
</p>
<p>
They turned down Borough Lane by the <i>Star</i> and knocked
Ruth up.
</p>
<p>
She was ironing and did not seem best pleased to see the
visitors.  Neither did Joe Burt, who was sitting by the fire
with little Alice on his knees.
</p>
<p>
The little lady ignored the engineer.
</p>
<p>
"Where are the other children?" she asked Ruth
pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
"Where they oughrer be," Joe answered—"in bed."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
"Is Caspar anywhere about?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"He's on his allotment, I reck'n," Ruth answered
coldly.  "Mr. Burt joins him there most in general every
evening."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Joe, "and was on the road now when A
was interfered with."  He kissed little Alice, put her down,
and rose.  "Good evening, Colonel."  And he went out
sullenly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor, aware that negotiations had not opened
auspiciously, now broached her project.  Ruth, steadily
ironing, never lifted her eyes.  She was clearly on the
defensive, suspicious in her questions, evasive and
noncommittal in her replies.  The Colonel became impatient.
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Caspar might accept our offer—to oblige," he
said at last.
</p>
<p>
Ruth deliberately laid down her iron, and challenged
him: she said nothing.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor felt the tension.
</p>
<p>
"Well, think it over, will you?" she said to Ruth.
"There's no hurry."
</p>
<p>
She went out and the Colonel followed.
</p>
<p>
"That man's the biggest humbug unhung even for a
Labour man," snapped the little lady viciously.  "Preaching
the Kingdom of Heaven on earth and then this!"
</p>
<p>
"I'm not sure," replied the Colonel, "not sure.  I
think he's much the same as most of us—an honest man
who's run off the rails."
</p>
<p>
They were bicycling slowly along Victoria Drive.  On
the far side of the allotments right under the wall of the
Downs, blue in the evening, a solitary figure was digging.
</p>
<p>
"The out-cast," said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor dismounted from her bicycle and began
wheeling it along the unfenced earthen path between the
gardens, towards the digger.  Ernie barely looked up,
barely answered her salutation, wiping the sweat off his
brow with the back of his hand as he continued his labour.
The lady retired along the way she had come.
</p>
<p>
"There's something Christ-like about the feller," said
the Colonel quietly as they reached the road.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," the little lady answered.  "Only he's brought
his troubles on his own head."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel drew up in haste.
</p>
<p>
"Hullo," he said, and began to read a newspaper placard,
for which class of literature he had a consuming passion.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
THE AVALANCHE MOVES
</h3>
<p>
The placard, seen by the Colonel, announced the opening
of a new scene in the Irish tragedy.
</p>
<p>
The King had summoned a Conference at Buckingham
Palace in order if possible to find a solution of the difficulty.
When the Conference met the King opened it in person
and, speaking as a man weighed down by anxiety, told
the members that for weeks he had watched with deep
misgivings the trend of events in Ireland.  "To-day the
cry of Civil War is on the lips of the most responsible of my
people," he said; and had added, so Mr. Trupp told the
Colonel, in words not reported in the Press, that the
European situation was so ominous as imperatively to
demand a solution of our domestic differences in order
that the nation might present a solid front to the world.
</p>
<p>
"And I bet he knows," ended the old surgeon, as he
said good-bye on the steps of the Manor-house.
</p>
<p>
"I bet he does," replied the Colonel.  "Thank God
there's one man in the country who's above party politics."  He
climbed thoughtfully on to the top of the bus outside
the <i>Star</i>, and, as it chanced, found himself sitting beside
Ernie, who was deep in his paper and began to talk.
</p>
<p>
"They ain't got it all their own way, then," he said,
grimly.  "I see the Irish Guards turned out and lined
the rails and cheered Redmond as he came down Birdcage
Walk back from the Conference."
</p>
<p>
"I don't like it," replied the Colonel gloomily.  "Rotten
discipline.  The Army has no politics."
</p>
<p>
"What about the officers at the Curragh?" asked Ernie
almost aggressively.  "They begun it.  Give the men
a chance too."
</p>
<p>
"Two wrong things don't make a right," retorted the
Colonel sharply.
</p>
<p>
Ernie got down at the station without a word.  Was
it an accident the Colonel, sensitive as a girl, asked
himself? was it a deliberate affront?  What was the world
coming to?  That man an old Hammer-man!  One
of Bobby Bermondsey yahoos wouldn't treat him so!
</p>
<p>
Indeed the avalanche was now sliding gradually down
the mountain-side, gathering way as it went, to overwhelm
the smiling villages sleeping peacefully in the valley.
</p>
<p>
Next day oppressed by imminent catastrophe, the
Colonel, climbing Beau-nez in the afternoon to take up
his habitual post of vigil by the flag-staff, found Joe Burt
and Mr. Geddes already there.
</p>
<p>
Both men, he marked, greeted him almost sombrely.
</p>
<p>
"It looks to me very serious," he said.  "Austria means
to go for Serbia, that's clear; and if she does Russia isn't
going to stand by and see Serbia swallowed up.  What
d'you think, Mr. Geddes?"
</p>
<p>
The other answered him on that note of suppressed
indignation which characterised increasingly his utterance
when he touched on this often discussed subject.
</p>
<p>
"I think Colonel, what I've thought all along," he
answered: "that if we're in the eve of a European eruption
the attitude of the officers of the British Army is
perfectly <i>inexplicable</i>."
</p>
<p>
He was firm almost to ferocity.
</p>
<p>
"Hear! hear!" growed Joe.
</p>
<p>
"But they don't know, poor beggars!" cried the
Colonel, exasperated yet appealing.  He felt as he had
felt throughout the controversy that he was fighting with
his hands tied behind his back.  "Do be just, Mr. Geddes.
They are merely the playthings of the politicians.  O,
if you only knew the regimental officer as I know him!  He's
like that St. Bernard dog over there by the coast-guard
station—the most foolish and faithful creature on God's
earth.  Smith pats him on the head and tells him he's a
good dorg, and he'll straightway beg for the privilege of
being allowed to die for Smith.  What's a poor ignorant devil
of a regimental officer quartered at Aldershot or the Curragh
or Salisbury Plain likely to know of the European situation?"
</p>
<p>
The tall minister was not to be appeased.
</p>
<p>
"Ignorance seems to me a poor justification for insubordination
in an Army officer," he said.  "And even if one is
to accept that excuse for the regimental officers, one can't
for a man like the Director of Military Strategics, who is
said to have specialised in war with Germany.  Yet that
is the man who has co-operated, to put it at the mildest, in
arming a huge rebel force with guns from the very country
he has always affirmed <i>we're bound to fight</i>.  It's stabbing
the Empire in the back, neither more nor less."
</p>
<p>
He was pale, almost dogmatic.
</p>
<p>
Then Joe barged in, surly and brutal.
</p>
<p>
"The whole truth is," he said, "that the officers of
the British Army to-day don't know how to spell the word
Duty.  Havelock did.  Gordon did.  And all the world
respected them accordingly.  These men don't.  They've
put their party before their coontry as A've always said they
would when the pinch came."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was trembling slightly.
</p>
<p>
"If the test comes," he said, "we shall see."
</p>
<p>
"The test <i>has</i> come," retorted the other savagely,
"And we <i>have</i> seen."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked swiftly away.  In front of him
half a mile from the flag-staff, he marked a man standing
waist-deep in a clump of gorse.  There was something
so forlorn about the figure that the Colonel approached,
only to find that it was Ernie, who on his side, seeing the
other, quitted the ambush, and came slowly towards him.
To the Colonel the action seemed a cry of distress.  All
his resentment at the incident on the bus melted away in
a great compassion.
</p>
<p>
"She and me used to lay there week-ends when first
we married," Ern said dreamily, nodding towards the
gorse he had just left.
</p>
<p>
"And she and you will live <i>there</i> for many happy
years, I hope," replied the Colonel warmly, pointing
towards the garage in the coombe beneath them.
</p>
<p>
Ernie regarded him inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
"What's that, sir?"
</p>
<p>
"Aren't you coming?"
</p>
<p>
"Where to?"
</p>
<p>
"My garage?"
</p>
<p>
Ernie did not understand and the Colonel explained.
</p>
<p>
"Didn't Mrs. Caspar tell you?"
</p>
<p>
"Ne'er a word," the other answered blankly.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The Colonel dropped down to Carlisle Road.  There
Mr. Trupp picked him up and drove him on to the club
for tea.  Fresh news from Ulster was just being ticked
off on the tape.  An hour or two before, a rebel unit,
the East Belfast regiment of volunteers, some 5,000 strong,
armed with Mausers imported from Germany, and dragging
machine-guns warm from Krupp's, had marched through
the streets of Belfast.  The police had cleared the way
for the insurgents; and soldiers of the King, officers and
men, had looked on with amusement.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned away.
</p>
<p>
"Roll up the map of Empire!" he said.  "We'd better
send a deputation to Lajput Rai and the Indian Home
Rulers and beg them to spare us a few baboos to govern
us.  Its an abdication of Government."
</p>
<p>
He went into the ante-room.
</p>
<p>
There was Stanley Bessemere back from Ulster once
more.  As usual he sat behind a huge cigar, retailing
amidst roars of laughter to a sympathetic audience his
exploits and those of his caracoling chief.  The European
situation had not overclouded him.
</p>
<p>
"There's going to be a Civil War and Smith and I are
going to be in it.  We shall walk through the Nationalists like
so much paper.  They've got no arms; and they've got no
guts either."  He laughed cheerily.  "Bad men.  Bad men."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel stood, an accusing figure in the door, and
eyed the fair-haired giant with cold resentment.
</p>
<p>
"You know Kuhlmann from the German Embassy
is over with your people in Belfast?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The other waved an airy cigar.
</p>
<p>
"You can take it from me, my dear Colonel, that he's
not," he answered.
</p>
<p>
"I'll take nothing of the sort from you," the Colonel
answered acridly.  "He's there none the less because he's
there incognito."
</p>
<p>
The young man winced; and the Colonel withdrew.
</p>
<p>
"Jove!" he said.  "I'd just like to know how far these
beggars have trafficked in treason with Germany."
</p>
<p>
"Not at all," replied Mr. Trupp.  "They've humbugged
emselves into believing they're 'running great risks
in a great cause,' as they say—or doing the dirty to make a
party score, as you and I'd put it.  That's all."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked home, oppressed.  After supper,
as he sat with his wife in the loggia, he told her of Ruth's
strange secretiveness in the matter of the garage.
</p>
<p>
"There she is!" said Mrs. Lewknor quietly nodding
over her work.  Ruth, indeed, was strolling slowly
along the cliff from the direction of the Meads in the
gorgeous evening.  Opposite the hostel a track runs down
to the beach beneath.  At that point she paused as though
waiting for somebody; and then disappeared from view.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later Mrs. Lewknor spoke again in the
same hushed voice.
</p>
<p>
"Here's the other!"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel looked up.  Joe was coming rapidly
along the cliff from the direction of Beau-nez.  He too
disappeared down the way Ruth had already taken.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel removed his glasses.
</p>
<p>
"I shall give em a quarter of an hour to make emselves
quite comfortable," he muttered "and then—"
</p>
<p>
"Spy," said Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
A moment later, Anne, the parlour-maid, showed
Mr. Alfred Caspar on to the loggia.
</p>
<p>
The face of the Manager of Caspar's Syndicate was very
long.  Alf, cherishing the simple faith that the Colonel
because he had been a soldier must be in the secrets
certainly of the War Office and possibly of the Government,
had come to ask what he thought of the European situation.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was not reassuring, but he refused to commit
himself.  Alf turned away almost sullenly.
</p>
<p>
"See, it matters to me," he said.  "I start Bank
Holiday.  Don't want no wars interfering with my
Syndicate."
</p>
<p>
"It matters to us all a bit," replied the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
Alf departed aggrieved, and obviously suggesting that
the Colonel was to blame.  He walked away with downward
eyes.  Suddenly the Colonel saw him pause, creep
to the cliff-edge, and peep over.  Then he came back to
the hostel in a stealthy bustle.
</p>
<p>
"Go and look for yourself then, sir, if you don't believe
me!" he cried in the tone of one rebuffing an unjust
accusation.  "You're a Magistrate.  Police ought to stop it I say.
Public 'arlotry I call it."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel's face became cold and very lofty.
"No, Caspar.  I don't do that sort of thing," he said.
</p>
<p>
Alf, muttering excuses, departed.  The Colonel watched
him walk along the dotted coast-guard track and disappear
round the shoulder of the coombe.  Then he rose and strolled
out to meet Ernie who was approaching.
</p>
<p>
As he did so he heard voices from the beach beneath
him and peeped over.  Ruth, on her hands and knees amid
the chalk boulders at the foot of the cliff, was
smoothing the sand and spreading something on it.
</p>
<p>
A few yards away Joe was standing at the edge of the
tide, which was almost high, flinging pebbles idly into the
water.  Some earth dislodged from the Colonel's feet and
made a tiny land-slide.  The woman on her hands and
knees in the growing dusk beneath looked up and saw the
man standing above her.  She made no motion, kneeling
there; facing him, fighting him, mocking him.
</p>
<p>
"Having a nice time together?" he asked genially.
</p>
<p>
"Just going to, thank-you kindly," Ruth replied
and resumed her occupation of sweeping with her hands.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned to find Ernie standing beside him
and burning his battle-flare.
</p>
<p>
"Lucky I see you coming, sir," he said, trembling still.
"Else I might ha done him a mischief."
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"Alf.  Insultin her and me.  Met him just along back
there in Meads by the <i>Ship</i>."
</p>
<p>
"Go easy, Caspar," said the Colonel quietly.  "I
remember that left-handed punch of yours of old.  It's
a good punch too; but keep it for the enemies of your
country."
</p>
<p>
Ernie was hugging a big biscuit-box under his arm.
</p>
<p>
"What you got there?" asked the other.
</p>
<p>
Ernie grinned a thought sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
"It's Joe's birthday," he said.  "We are having a
bit of a do under the cliff."
</p>
<p>
He hovered a moment as though about to impart a confidence
to the other; and then disappeared down the little
track to the beach beneath at the trot, his shoulders back,
and heels digging in, carrying a slither of chalk with him.
</p>
<p>
"'Come into my parlour,' said the spider to the fly,"
muttered the Colonel as he turned into Undercliff.  "Poor
fly!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
THE GROWING ROAR
</h3>
<p>
The avalanche, once started, was moving fast now.  The
Irish Nationalists who had lost faith in the power of the
Government and the will of the Army to protect them, had
decided at last to arm in view of the default of the law
that they might resist invasion from the North-East.
</p>
<p>
On the very day after the parade of insurrectionaries in
Belfast a famous Irishman, soldier, sailor, statesman,
man of letters, who in his young manhood had served
throughout the long-drawn South African War the Empire which
had refused liberty to his country alone of all her Colonies,
and in the days to come, though now in his graying years,
was to be the hero of one of the most desperate ventures
of the Great War, ran the little <i>Asgarde</i>, her womb heavy
with strange fruit, into Howth Harbour while the Sunday
bells peeled across the quiet waters, calling to church.
</p>
<p>
The arms were landed and marched under Nationalist
escort towards Dublin.  The police and a company of
King's Own Scottish Borderers met the party and blocked
the way.  After a parley the Nationalists dispersed and the
soldiers marched back to Dublin through a hostile
demonstration.  Mobbed, pelted, provoked to the last degree,
at Bachelor's Walk, on the quay, where owing to the
threatening attitude of the crowd they had been halted,
the men took the law into their own hands and fired without
the order of their officer.  Three people were killed.
</p>
<p>
The incident led to the first quarrel that had taken
place between Ernie and Joe Burt in a friendship now of
some years standing.
</p>
<p>
"Massacre by the military," said Joe.  "That's what
it is."
</p>
<p>
The old soldier in Ernie leapt to the alert.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what would you have had em do?" he cried
hotly.  "Lay down and let emselves be kicked to death?"
</p>
<p>
"If the soldiers want to shoot at all let em shoot the
armed rebels," retorted Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Let em shoot the lot, I says," answered Ernie.  "I'm
sick of it.  Ireland!  Ireland!  Ireland all the time.  No
one's no time to think of poor old England.  Yet we've our
troubles too, I reck'n."
</p>
<p>
Joe went out surlily without saying good-night.  When
he was gone, Ruth who had been listening, looked up at
Ernie, a faint glow of amusement, interest, surprise, in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>
"First time ever I knaw'd you and Joe get acrarst
each other," she said.
</p>
<p>
Ernie, biting home on his pipe, did not meet her gaze.
</p>
<p>
"First," he said.  "Not the last, may be."
</p>
<p>
She put down dish-cloth and dish, came to him, and
put her hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"Let me look at you, Ern!"
</p>
<p>
His jaw was set, almost formidable: he did not speak.
</p>
<p>
"Kiss me, Ern," she said.
</p>
<p>
For a moment his eyes hovered on her face.
</p>
<p>
"D'you mean anything?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Not that," she answered and dropped her hand.
</p>
<p>
"Then to hell with you!" he cried with a kind of
desperate savagery and thrust her brutally away.
"Sporting with a man!"
</p>
<p>
He put on his cap and went out.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes he was back.  Paying no heed to her,
he sat down at the kitchen-table and wrote a note, which
he put on the mantel-piece.
</p>
<p>
"You can give this to Alf next time he comes round for
the rent," he said.
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"Notice," Ern answered.  "We're going to shift to the
Colonel's garage."
</p>
<p>
Ruth gave battle instantly.
</p>
<p>
"Who are?" she cried, facing him.
</p>
<p>
He met her like a hedge of bayonets.
</p>
<p>
"I am," he answered.  "Me and my children."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The volley fired on Bachelor's Walk, as it echoed down
the long valleys of the world, seemed to serve the purpose
of Joshua's trumpet.  Thereafter all the walls of
civilisation began to crash down one after another with the
roar of ruined firmaments.
</p>
<p>
Forty-eight hours later Austria declared war.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday Mr. Asquith, speaking in a crowded and
quiet house, proposed the postponement of the Home Rule
Bill.
</p>
<p>
Even the hotheads were sober now.
</p>
<p>
Stanley Bessemere discarded his uniform of an Ulster
Volunteer in haste, and turned up at the club in chastened
mood.  He was blatant still, a little furtive, notably
less truculent.  The martial refrain <i>Smith and I</i> had
given place to the dulcet coo <i>We must all pull together</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Is he ashamed?" Mrs. Lewknor asked her husband,
hushed herself, and perhaps a little guilty.
</p>
<p>
"My dear," the Colonel replied.  "Shame is not a word
known to your politician.  He's thoroughly frightened.
All the politicians are.  There're bluffing for all they're
worth."
</p>
<p>
On the Saturday morning the Colonel went to the club.
The junior member for Beachbourne, who was there, and for
once uncertain of himself, showed himself childishly
anxious to forget and forgive.
</p>
<p>
"Now look here, Colonel!" he said, charming and bright.
"If there's an almighty bust-up now, shall you <i>really</i>
blame it all on Ulster?  Honest Injun!"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel met him with cold flippancy.
</p>
<p>
"Every little helps," he said.  "A whisper'll start an
avalanche, as any mountaineer could tell you."
</p>
<p>
He took up the <i>Nation</i> of August 1st and began to read
the editor's impassioned appeal to the country to stand
out.  The Colonel read the article twice over.  There
could be no question of the white-hot sincerity of the writer,
and none that he voiced the sentiments of an immense
and honest section of the country.
</p>
<p>
He put the paper down and walked home.
</p>
<p>
"If we don't go in," he said calmly to his wife at luncheon,
"all I can say is, that I shall turn my back on England
for ever and go and hide my head for the rest of my days
on the borders of Thibet."
</p>
<p>
In those last days of peace good men and true agonised
in their various ways.  Few suffered more than the Colonel;
none but his wife knew the agony of his doubt.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Trupp telephoned to say that Germany had
sent an ultimatum to Russia, and that France was
mobilising.  Mr. Cambon had interviewed the King.  The
Government was still wavering.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel's course was evident.  The little organisation
for which he was responsible must express itself, if only
in the shrill sharp voice of a mosquito.  A meeting of the
League must be convened.  Tingling with hope, doubt, fear,
shame, he set off in the evening to interview Alfred Caspar.
Swiftly he crossed the golf-links and turned into Saffrons
Croft.  There he paused.
</p>
<p>
It was one of those unforgettable evenings magnificently
calm, which marked with triumphant irony the end of the
world.  The green park with its cluster of elms presented
its usual appearance on a Saturday afternoon.  The honest
thump of the ball upon the bat, so dear to English hearts,
resounded on every side: the following cry—Run it out! the
groups of youths sprawling about the scorers, the lounging
spectators.  Not a rumour of the coming storm had touched
those serene hearts.  Close to him a bevy of women and
children were playing a kind of rounders.  The batter was
a big young woman whom he recognised at once as Ruth.
</p>
<p>
One of the the fielders was little Alice scudding about the
surface of green on thin black legs like a water-beetle on a
pond.  Then Ernie saw him and came sauntering towards
him, a child clinging solemnly to one finger of each hand.
There was an air of strain about the old Hammer-man, as of
one waiting on the alert for a call, that distinguished him, so
the Colonel thought, from the gay throng.
</p>
<p>
"What about it, sir?" he asked gravely.
</p>
<p>
"It's coming, Caspar," the Colonel answered.  "That's
my belief."
</p>
<p>
"And I shan't be sorry if it does," said Ernie with a
quiet vindictiveness.
</p>
<p>
"Shall you go?" asked the Colonel.  He knew the other's
time as a reservist was up.
</p>
<p>
"Sha'n't I?" Ernie answered with something like a snort.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was not deceived.  It was not the patriot,
not the old soldier, who had uttered that cry of distress:
it was the human being, bruised and suffering, and anxious
to vent his pain in violence on something or somebody, no
matter much who.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, I shall go, if it's only as cook in the Army
Service Corps."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel shook his head.
</p>
<p>
"If it comes," he said, "every fighting man'll be wanted
in his right place.  Would you like to rejoin the old
battalion at Aldershot, if I can work it for you?  Then
you'd go out with the Expeditionary Force."
</p>
<p>
Ernie's eyes gleamed.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, just wouldn't I?" he said.
</p>
<p>
Just then there was a shout from the players.  Ruth
was out and retired.  She came towards them, glowing,
laughing, her fingers touching her hair to order.  She was
thirty now, but at that moment she did not look twenty-five.
Then she saw the Colonel and deliberately turned away.
Susie and Jenny pursued their mother.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked off through the groups of white-clad
players towards Alf's garage in the Goffs.  A tall man
was standing at the gate on to Southfields Road,
contemplating the English scene with austere gaze.
</p>
<p>
It was Royal—the man who would know.
</p>
<p>
"You think it's going to be all right?" asked the
Colonel so keen as to forget his antipathy.
</p>
<p>
"Heaven only knows with this Government," the other
replied.  "I've just been on the telephone.  Haldane's
going back to the War Office, they say."
</p>
<p>
"Thank God for it!" cried the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
His companion shrugged.
</p>
<p>
"Henry Wilson's in touch with Maxse and the Conservative
press," he said.  "He's getting at the Opposition.
There's to be a meeting at Lansdowne House to-night.
H.W.'s going to ginger em."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel looked away.
</p>
<p>
"And what are you doing down here?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"They sent me down to Newhaven last night—embarkation.
I'm off in two minutes."  He jerked his head towards
a racing car standing outside the garage, white with dust.
"Got to catch the 7 o'clock at Lewes, and be back at
the War Office at 9 p.m.  An all-night sitting, I
expect."  That austere gaze of his returned to the playing-fields.
"Little they know what they're in for," he said, as though
to himself.
</p>
<p>
For the first time the Colonel found something admirable,
almost comforting, in the hardness of his old adjutant.  He
followed the other's gaze and then said quietly, almost
tenderly, as one breathing a secret in the ear of a dying
man.
</p>
<p>
"That's the child, Royal—that one in the white frock
and black legs running over by the elms.  And that's her
mother in the brown dress—the one waving.  And there's
her husband under the trees—that shabby feller."
</p>
<p>
Royal arched his fine eyebrows in faint surprise.
</p>
<p>
"Is she married?" he asked coolly.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied the Colonel.  "The feller who seduced
her wouldn't do the straight thing by her."
</p>
<p>
Again the eyebrows spoke, this time with an added
touch of sarcasm, almost of insolence.
</p>
<p>
"How d'you know?"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was roused.
</p>
<p>
"Well, did you?" he asked, with rare brutality.
</p>
<p>
Royal shrugged.  Then he turned slow and sombre
eyes on the other.  There was no anger in them, no
hostility.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps I shall make it up to them now, Colonel,"
he said....
</p>
<p>
The Colonel crossed the road to the garage.  There was
a stir of busyness about two of the new motor char-a-bancs
of the Touring Syndicate.  Alf was moving amid it all in
his shirt-sleeves, without collar or tie, his hands filthy.
His moustache still waxed, and his hair parted down the
middle and plastered, made an almost comic contrast to
the rest of his appearance.  But there was nothing comic
about his expression.  He looked like a dog sickening for
rabies; ominous, surly, on the snarl.  He did not seem to
see the Colonel, who tackled him at once, however, about
the need for summoning a meeting of the League.
</p>
<p>
"Summon it yourself then," said Alf.  "I got something
better to do than that.  Such an idea!  Coming botherin
me just now.  Start on Monday.  Ruin starin me in the
face.  Who wants war?  Might ha done it on purpose
to do me down."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel climbed the hill to the Manor-house to sup
with the Trupps.
</p>
<p>
Two hours later, as he left the house, Ernie Caspar
turned the corner of Borough Lane, and came towards him,
lost in dreams.  The Colonel waited for him.  There was
about the old Hammer-man that quality of forlornness
which the Colonel had noted in him so often of late.  He
took his place by the other's side.  They walked down the
hill together silently until they were clear of the houses,
and Saffrons Croft lay broad-spread and fragrant upon their
right.
</p>
<p>
In the growing dusk the spirits of the two men drew
together.  Then Ernie spoke.
</p>
<p>
"It's not Joe, sir," he said.  "He's all right, Joe is."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel did not fence.
</p>
<p>
"Are you sure?" he asked with quiet emphasis.
</p>
<p>
"Certain sure," the other answered with astonishing
vehemence.  "It's Ruth.  She won't give me ne'er a
chance."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel touched him in the dusk.
</p>
<p>
"Bad luck," he muttered.  "She'll come round."
</p>
<p>
It was an hour later and quite dark when he rounded
the shoulder of Beau-nez and turned into the great coombe,
lit only by the windows of his own house shining out against
Beau-nez.
</p>
<p>
Walking briskly along the cliff, turning over eternally
the question whether England would be true to herself,
he was aware of somebody stumbling towards him, talking
to himself, probably drunk.  The Colonel drew aside off
the chalk-blazed path to let the other pass.
</p>
<p>
"A don't know justly what to make on't," came a broad
familiar accent.
</p>
<p>
"Why, it's fight or run away," replied the Colonel,
briskly.  "No two twos about it."
</p>
<p>
A sturdy figure loomed up alongside him.
</p>
<p>
"Then it's best run away, A reckon," answered the
other, "afore worse comes on't.  What d'you say, Colonel?"
</p>
<p>
The darkness drew the two men together with invisible
bonds just as an hour before it had drawn the Colonel
and Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"What is it, Burt?" asked the Colonel, gently.
</p>
<p>
He felt profoundly the need of this other human being
standing over against him in the darkness, lonely, suffering,
riven with conflicting desires.
</p>
<p>
Joe drew closer.  He was sighing, a sigh that was almost
a sob.  Then he spoke in the hushed and urgent mutter of
a schoolboy making a confession.
</p>
<p>
"It's this, Colonel—man to man.  Hast ever been in
love with a woman as you oughtn't to be?"
</p>
<p>
Not for the first time in these last months there was
strong upon the Colonel the sense that here before him was
an honest man struggling in the toils prepared for him by
Nature—the Lion with no mouse to gnaw him free.  Yet
he was aware more strongly than ever before of that deep
barrier of class which in this fundamental matter of sex
makes itself more acutely felt than in any other.  A man of
quite unusual breadth of view, imagination, and sympathy,
this was the one topic that some inner spirit of delicacy
had always forbidden him to discuss except with his own
kind.  He was torn in two; and grateful to the kindly
darkness that covered him.  On the one hand were all the
inhibitions imposed upon him by both natural delicacy and
artificial yet real class-restraint; on the other there was his
desire to help a man he genuinely liked.  Should he take
the line of least resistance, the line of the snob and the
coward?  Was it really the fact that because this man was
not a gentleman he could not lay bare before him an
experience that might save him?
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said at last with the emphasis of the man who
is forcing himself.
</p>
<p>
There was a lengthy silence.
</p>
<p>
"Were you married?"
</p>
<p>
"No," abruptly.  "Of course not."
</p>
<p>
"Was she?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"What happened?"
</p>
<p>
"She wired me to come—in India—years ago."
</p>
<p>
"Did you go?"
</p>
<p>
"No—thank God."  The honest man in him added:
"I never got the wire."
</p>
<p>
Again there was a pause.
</p>
<p>
"Are you glad?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes."
</p>
<p>
"Had she children."
</p>
<p>
"No."
</p>
<p>
The engineer breathed deep.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," he said.  "I'd ha gone."
</p>
<p>
"Then you'd have done wrong."
</p>
<p>
"Happen so," stubbornly.  "I'd ha gone
though—knowing what I know now."
</p>
<p>
"What's that?"
</p>
<p>
"What loov is."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel paused.
</p>
<p>
"She'd never have forgiven you," he said at last.
</p>
<p>
"What for?"
</p>
<p>
"For taking advantage of her hot fit."
</p>
<p>
The arrow shot in the dark had clearly gone home.  The
Colonel followed up his advantage.
</p>
<p>
"Is she in love with you?"
</p>
<p>
"She's never said so."
</p>
<p>
"But you think so?"
</p>
<p>
"Nay, A don't think so," the other answered with all
the old violence.  "A know it.  A've nobbut to reach out
ma hand to pluck the flower."
</p>
<p>
His egotism annoyed the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Seems to me," he said, "we shall all of us soon have
something better to do than running round after each
other's wives.  Seen the evening paper?"
</p>
<p>
"Nay, nor the morning for that matter."
</p>
<p>
"And you a politician!"
</p>
<p>
"A'm two men—same as most: politician and lover.
Now one's a-top; now t'other.  It's a see-saw."
</p>
<p>
"And the lover's on top now?" said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said the engineer, "and like to stay there
too—blast him!"  And he was gone in the darkness.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
OLD TOWN
</h3>
<p>
Next day was Sunday.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel waited on the cliff for his paper, which
brought the expected news.  The die was cast.  Germany
had proclaimed martial law: she was already at war
with Russia; France had mobilised.
</p>
<p>
"She's in it by now," he said to himself, as he walked
across the golf-links towards Old Town.
</p>
<p>
The threat of danger was arousing in every individual
a passionate need for communication, for re-assurance,
for the warmth and comfort of the crowd.  The herd, about
to be attacked, was drawing together.  Its out-posts were
coming back at the trot, heads high, ears alert, snorting the
alarm.  Even the rogue and outcast were seeking re-admission
and finding it amid acclamation.  The main body
were packing in a square, heads to the danger, nostrils
quivering, antlers ready.  An enemy was a-foot just beyond
the sky-line.  He has not declared himself as yet.  But
the wind betrayed his presence; and the secret stir of the
disturbed and fearful wilderness was evidence enough that
the Flesh-eater was abroad.
</p>
<p>
The turf sprang deliciously beneath the Colonel's feet.
His youth seemed to have returned to him.  He felt curiously
braced and high of heart.  Once he paused to look about
him.  Beyond the huge smooth bowl of the links with
its neat greens and the little boxes of sand, its pleasant
club-house, its evidence of a smooth and leisurely civilisation,
Paradise rippled at the touch of a light-foot breeze.
The Downs shimmered radiantly, their blemishes hidden in
the mists of morning.  On his right, beyond the ha-ha, the
Duke's Lodge stood back in quiet dignity amid its beeches,
typical of the England that was about to fade away like
a cinema picture at a touch.
</p>
<p>
A lark sang.  The Colonel lifted his face to the speck
poised and thrilling in the blue.
</p>
<p>
What a day to go to war on! was his thought.
</p>
<p>
At the deserted club-house he dropped down into Lovers'
Lane and climbed up towards Old Town between high flint
walls, ivy-covered.
</p>
<p>
As he emerged into Rectory Walk the Archdeacon was
coming out of his gate.  He was in his glory.  His faded
eyes glittered like those of an old duellist about to engage,
and confident of his victim.
</p>
<p>
"I've been waiting this day for forty-five yeahs,"
he announced.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was aware of the legend that in 1870 the
Archdeacon, then a lad at Cambridge, had only been
restrained from fighting for his hero, the Emperor of the
French, by a brutal father.
</p>
<p>
"It certainly looks as if you might get back a bit of your
own," he said wearily.  The other's dreadful exaltation
served only to depress him.  "Russia going at em one
side and France the other."
</p>
<p>
"And England!" cried the Archdeacon.
</p>
<p>
"You think we shall go in?"
</p>
<p>
To the Colonel's horror, the Archdeacon took him by
the arm.
</p>
<p>
"Can you doubt it?" he cried, rolling his eyes to see
the impression he was making on the grocer in the door of
the little corner-shop.  "Are we rotten to the heart?"
</p>
<p>
They were walking down Church Street now, arm-in-arm,
in the middle of the road.
</p>
<p>
"The pity of it is," he cried in his staccato voice, "we've
no Emperah to lead us to-day.  Ah! there was a man!"  He
made a dramatic halt in mid-street.  "<i>Thank Gahd
for Carson—what!</i>" he whispered.
</p>
<p>
"And Smith," said the Colonel meekly.  "Let us give
thanks for Smith too—
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Great in counsel, great in war,<br>
  Foremost Captain of our time,<br>
  Rich in saving common sense,<br>
  And, as the greatest only are,<br>
  In his simplicity sublime.</i>"<br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
They had reached the door of the parish-church.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon entered; and the Colonel turned with
relief to greet Bobby Chislehurst.  The lad's open face
was unusually grave.
</p>
<p>
"There are sure to be pacifist demonstrations in London
to-morrow," he began, blurting out his confidences like a
a school-boy.  "It's my day off.  I shall go."
</p>
<p>
"Don't," said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"I must," the other replied.  "It's all I can do."
</p>
<p>
"Bobby," said the Colonel grimly.  "This is my advice.
If you go up to London at all wire to Billy to come and meet
you.  He may be able to get an hour off, though I expect
they're pretty busy at Aldershot."  Billy was Bobby's
twin-brother and in the Service.
</p>
<p>
Bobby winced.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said, "if Billy goes, Billy won't come back.
I know Billy."
</p>
<p>
A few yards down the street the Colonel met Alf Caspar
in the stream of ascending church-goers.
</p>
<p>
The little sidesman was dapper as usual: he wore a
fawn coloured waist-coat, his moustache was waxed, his
hair well-oiled; but his face was almost comically a-wry.
He looked like the villain in a picture play about to burst
into tears.  Directly he saw the Colonel he roused to new
and hectic life, crossing to him, entirely forgetful of their
meeting on the previous evening.
</p>
<p>
"Is it war, sir?" he asked feverishly and with flickering
eyes.
</p>
<p>
"If we are ever to hold up our heads and look the world
in the face again," the Colonel answered.
</p>
<p>
"But what's it got to do with us?" Alf almost screamed.
"Let em fight it out among themselves if they want to,
I says.  Stand aside—that's our part.  That's the manly
part.  And then when it's all over slip in—"
</p>
<p>
"And collar the loot," suggested the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"And arbitrate atween em.  If we don't there'll be nobody
to do it, only us.  I don't say it'll be easy to make the
sacrifice o standing aside when you want to help your
friends, of course you do.  But I say we ought to do it,
and let em say what they like—if it's right and it is right.
Take up the cross and face the shame—that's what I says.
Where's the good o being Christians else, if you're going
to throw it all overboard first time you're put to the test?
We won't be the first, I says.  What about the martyrs
and them?  Didn't they go through it?  Not to talk
o the expense!  Can we afford it?  Course we can't.  Who
could?  Income tax at a shilling in the pound, and my petrol
costing me another six-pence the can.  And then ask us
to sit down to a great war!"
</p>
<p>
He poured out his arguments as a volcano in eruption
pours out lava.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel listened.
</p>
<p>
"You'd better give your views to your Rector, I think,"
he remarked.
</p>
<p>
Alf's face turned ugly.
</p>
<p>
"One thing," he said, with an ominously vicious nod,
"if there is war I resign my position in the League—that's
straight."
</p>
<p>
"O dear!" said the Colonel, and he turned into the
Manor-house.
</p>
<p>
Bess opened to him herself.
</p>
<p>
"Joe come?" he asked, knowing she was expecting
her brother for the week-end.
</p>
<p>
"No.  A post-card instead.  We don't quite know
where he is."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel nodded.
</p>
<p>
"Leave stopped.  Sure to be."
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. Trupp came down the stairs.  About her was
the purged and hallowed air of one who faces death without
fear and yet without self-deception as to the price that must
be paid.  The Colonel felt he was standing upon holy ground.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp handed him a post-card.  The postmark
was Dover.  It ran:
</p>
<p>
<i>All well.  Very busy.</i>
</p>
<p>
"I think it'll be all right, don't you?" said Mrs. Trupp,
raising wistful eyes to his.  The mother in her longed for
him to say <i>No</i>: the patriot <i>Yes</i>.
</p>
<p>
"It must be," replied Bess, ferociously.  "If it isn't
Joe will chuck the Service.  They all will.  The pacifists
can defend their own rotten country!"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel moved into the consulting-room, where Mr. Trupp
was burrowing short-sightedly into his Sunday paper.
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon at least had no doubts.
</p>
<p>
"We shall fight all right," he said comfortably.  "We
must.  And Must's the only man who matters in real life."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel felt immensely comforted.
</p>
<p>
"But what a position my poor old party'd have been in
now if our leaders hadn't queered the pitch!" he remarked.
"<i>We told you so</i>!  <i>We told you so</i>!   How we <i>could</i> have
rubbed it in."
</p>
<p>
"Thank God you can't," replied the other grimly.
"No party's got the chuckle over another.  So there's
some hope that we may act as a country for once."
</p>
<p>
Outside the Manor-house the Colonel met Mr. Pigott
in his frock-coat on the way to chapel.  The two men had
never spoken for years past except to spar.  Now in the
presence of the common fear they stopped, and then shook
hands.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott was a brave man, but there was no doubt
he was shaken to the roots.
</p>
<p>
"My God, Colonel!" he muttered.  "It's <i>awful</i>."
</p>
<p>
"It don't look too pleasant," the old soldier admitted.
</p>
<p>
"But we can't go in!" cried the old Nonconformist.
"It's no affair of ours.  Who <i>are</i> the Serbs?"
</p>
<p>
"It's go in or go under, I'm afraid," the other answered.
"That's the alternative."
</p>
<p>
He dropped down Borough Lane past the <i>Star</i>.
</p>
<p>
On the hill Edward Caspar ambling rapidly along with
flying coat-tails caught him up.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Caspar, what do <i>you</i> think about it?"
asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
The old man emerged from his brown study and looked
up with scared eyes through his gold spectacles.  He did
not recognise the questioner: he never did—but he answered
eagerly, and with wonderful firmness.
</p>
<p>
"It's Love.  It can't be anything else."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know.  War seems to me a funny sort of
Love," the Colonel muttered.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?" asked the other.
</p>
<p>
"War," replied the Colonel.  "There's a great European
war on."
</p>
<p>
The old man, blind, puzzled, seeking, stopped dead.
</p>
<p>
"War?" he said.  "What war's that?"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel explained.
</p>
<p>
"Austria's gone to war with Serbia.  Russia's chimed
in.  Germany's having a go at Russia.  And France is
rushing to the rescue of her ally.  Europe's ablaze from the
Bay of Biscay to the Caucasus."
</p>
<p>
Edward Caspar blinked at the road as he absorbed the news.
Then he gathered himself and went droning down the hill at
increased speed with the erratic purposefulness of a great
bumble-bee.  There was something lofty, almost majestic about his
bearing.  In a moment he had increased in spiritual stature;
and he was trying to straighten his rounded shoulders.
</p>
<p>
"It must work itself out," he said emphatically.  "It's
only an incident on the march.  We mustn't lose our sense
of proportion.  We shall get there all the quicker in the
end because of it."
</p>
<p>
"We shall if we go this pace," muttered the Colonel,
pretending to pant as they turned into the Moot.
</p>
<p>
The Quaker meeting-house lay just in front of them,
a group of staid figures at the door.  On their left was a
row of cottages at the foot of the Church-crowned Kneb.
The door of one of them was open, and in it stood Ernie in
his shirt-sleeves, towel in hand, scrubbing his head.  A
word passed between father and son; then the old man
shuffled on his way.
</p>
<p>
Ernie turned in a flash to the Colonel, who saw at once
that here the miracle of sudden conversion had been at
work.  This man who for months past had been growing
always graver and more pre-occupied was suddenly gay.
A spring had been released; and a spirit had been tossed
into the air.  He seemed on the bubble, like an eager horse
tugging at its bridle.
</p>
<p>
Now he held up a warning finger and moved down the
road till he was out of ear-shot of his own cottage.
</p>
<p>
"Have you worked it, sir?" he asked.  His question
had reference to his conversation with the Colonel in Saffrons
Croft the evening before, and in his keenness he was oblivious
of the fact that nothing could have been achieved in the few
brief hours that had elapsed since their last meeting.
</p>
<p>
"I've written," replied the Colonel.  "You'll be wanted.
Every man who can stand on his hind-legs will.  That's
what I came about: If you have to join up it'll punish
your feet much less if you've done a bit of regular
route-marching first.  Now I'm game to come along every evening
and march with you.  Begin to-night.  Five to ten miles
steady'd soon tell.  What about it?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm at it, sir!" cried Ernie.  "Thank you kindly all
the same.  Started last night after we'd read the news.
There's a little bunch of us in Old Town—old sweats.
Marched to Friston, we did.  One hour's marching; ten
minutes halt.  Auston to-night.  We'll soon work into it."
</p>
<p>
"That's the style," said the Colonel.  "Are the other
men keen?"
</p>
<p>
Ernie grinned.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, they're for it, if it's got to be," he said.
</p>
<p>
"And Burt?—seen him?"
</p>
<p>
"No sir, not yet.  But he's all right at heart, Joe is.
I'm expectin him round every minute."
</p>
<p>
At the moment a thick-set man came swishing round the
corner of Borough Lane on a bicycle.  His shoulders were
hunched, and he was pedalling furiously.  The sweat shone
on his face, which was red and set.  It was clear that he had
come far and fast.  Seeing the two men in the road he flung
off his bicycle and drew up beside them at a little pattering
run.
</p>
<p>
Out here under the beat of the sun the Colonel hardly
recognised in this solid fellow, dark with purpose, the
wavering lover of the cliff last night.  Was the change
wrought in this man as by magic typical of a like change in
the heart of the country?  The thought flashed into the
Colonel's mind and brought him relief.
</p>
<p>
The engineer, who was heaving, came straight to his
point without a word, without a greeting.
</p>
<p>
"Philip Blackburn's coomin down on the rush to address
a great Stop-the-war meeting at the Salvation Army
Citadel this afternoon," he panted.  "We must counter
it.  A'm racin round to warn the boys to roll up.  You
must be there, Colonel, and you, Ern, and all of you.  It's
all out this time, and no mistake."
</p>
<p>
The door behind the Colonel opened.  He turned to
find Ruth standing in the door, drying her hands.
</p>
<p>
Joe paid no heed, already sprawling over his bicycle as
he pushed it off.
</p>
<p>
"What time?" she called after him.
</p>
<p>
"Two-thirty," he answered back, and was gone round
the corner.
</p>
<p>
"Right," she yodled.  "I'll be there."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
FOLLOW YOUR LEADER
</h3>
<p>
Philip Blackburn's meeting had not been advertised, for
it was only in the small hours of the morning that a
motor-bicyclist scaring the hares and herons in the marshes, had
brought the news from Labour Headquarters that P.B. was
bearing the Fiery Cross to Beachbourne in the course
of a whirlwind pilgrimage of the Southern Counties.  But
the hall was crammed.
</p>
<p>
Philip Blackburn was a sure draw at any time.  A Labour
M.P. and stalwart of the Independent Labour Party,
it was often said that he was destined to be the Robespierre
of the new movement.  Certainly he was an incorruptible.
A cripple from his youth, and a fanatic, with the face of
a Savonarola, in the House and on the platform he asked
no quarter and gave none.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later the dusty Ford car which bore the
fighting pacifist was signalled panting down Stone Cross
hill over the Levels: a half-hour the audience passed singing
<i>God save the People</i> and <i>The Red Flag</i>.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later he came limping on to the platform:
a little man, of the black-coated proletariat obviously,
with the face of a steel blade, keen and fine, and far-removed
from the burly labour agitator, hoarse of voice, and raw
of face, of a previous generation.  His reception was
impressively quiet.  The man's personality, his courage,
his errand, the occasion, awed even the most boisterous.
</p>
<p>
He looked dead-beat, admitted as much, and apologised
for being late.
</p>
<p>
"You know where I come from (cheers) and where I'm
bound for to-night.  And you know what I've come
about—<i>Is it Peace or War?</i>"
</p>
<p>
And he launched straightway into that famous
<i>Follow-your-leader</i> speech, the ghost of which in one form or
another was to haunt the country, as the murdered
albatross haunted the blood-guilty mariner, all through the
war, and will haunt England for generations still after we
are gone:—
</p>
<p>
The danger long-preached was on them at last.  It must
be faced and fought.  They must take a leaf out of Carson's
book.  The Conservatives had shown the way: they must
follow their leaders of the ruling class.  They must dish
the Government if it proposed to betray the country just
as the Unionists had done—by persuading the Army not
to fight.  They must undermine the <i>morale</i> of the private
soldiers—just as the Tories had undermined that of the
officers.  They must have their agents in every barrack-room,
their girls at every barrack-gate—just as the Tories
had done.  The men must apply the sternest "disciplinary
pressure" to scabs—just as the officers had done.  They
must stop recruiting—as Garvin and the Yellow Press had
advocated.  The famous doctrine of "optional obedience,"
newly introduced into the Army by Tory casuists, must
be carried to its logical conclusion.  And if the worst
came to the worst they must follow their leaders of the
ruling class, arm, and "fight the fighters.  <i>Follow your
leaders</i>—that is the word."
</p>
<p>
He spoke with cold and bitter passion in almost a complete
hush—a white-hot flame of a man burning straight and still
on the altar of a packed cathedral.  Then he sank back
into his chair, spent, his eyes closed, his face livid, his fine
fingers twitching.  He had achieved that rarest triumph
of the orator: beaten his audience into silence.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel stood up against the wall at the back.
Peering over intervening heads he saw Joe Burt sitting in
front.
</p>
<p>
Then a voice at his ear, subdued and deep and vibrating,
floated out on the hush as it were on silver wings.
</p>
<p>
"Now, Joe!" it said, like a courser urging on a greyhound.
</p>
<p>
There was a faint stir in the stillness: the eyes of the
orator on the platform opened.  A chair scraped; the
woman beside the Colonel sighed.  There was some sporadic
cheering, and an undercurrent of groans.
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt rose to his feet slowly and with something of
the solemn dignity of one rising from the dead.  Everybody
present knew him; nobody challenged his right to speak.
A worker and a warrior, who had lived in the East-end
for some years now, he had his following, and he had his
enemies.  The moderate men were for him, the extremists
had long marked him down as suspect—in with the
capitalists—too fond of the classy class.  But they would
hear him; for above all things he was that which the
Englishman loves best in friend or enemy—a fighter.
</p>
<p>
Standing there, thick-set and formidable as a bull, he
began the speech of his life.
</p>
<p>
"Two wrongs don't make a right.  Because the officers
have sold the pass, are the men to do the same?"
</p>
<p>
"Never!" came a shout from the back.  It was Ernie's
voice.  The Colonel recognised it and thrilled.
</p>
<p>
"We all know," continued the speaker, "that the gentry
have put their coontry after their party.  It's for the People
to show them the true road, and put Democracy before
even their coontry."
</p>
<p>
"Hear! hear!" from Philip Blackburn.
</p>
<p>
The speaker was growing to his task, growing as it grew.
</p>
<p>
"This is a great spiritual issue.  Are we to save our
lives to lose them? or lose them to save them?  The People
are in the Valley of Decision.  God and the Devil are
standing on a mountain-top on either side the way
crying—<i>Who is on my side?</i>"  His great voice went billowing
through the hall, borne, it seemed, on some huge wind of
the spirit.  He was holding the audience, carrying them.
The Colonel felt it: the man with the closed eyelids in the
chair on the platform felt it too.
</p>
<p>
"Jaures, the beloved leader of our cause in France,
has already made his choice—the first man to fall for
Democracy.  Shall he lie alone?"
</p>
<p>
It was a dramatic touch, and told.
</p>
<p>
"A have chosen ma part," the speaker went on more
quietly.  "A loov ma coontry; but there's something
greater even than the fate of the coontry hanging in the
balance now.  Democracy's at stake!"
</p>
<p>
A roar of applause greeted the remark.
</p>
<p>
"It's the Emperors agin the People!"
</p>
<p>
This time the roar was pierced by a shrill scream,
</p>
<p>
"What about Russia?"
</p>
<p>
The booming voice over-rode the interruption as a
hurricane over-rides a blade of grass that stands in its track.
</p>
<p>
"Look at little Serbia!—a handful of peasants standing
up against a great militarist Empire.  Look at Belgium!—the
most peaceful nation on God's earth about to be over-run
by the Kaiser's hordes.  Look at France, the mother of
Revolution, and the home of Democracy!—Could we
forsake them now?"
</p>
<p>
"Never!" in a growing thunder.
</p>
<p>
"If so we forsook our own ideals, betrayed our past,
turned our back on our future.  Yea.  The People must
fight or perish."
</p>
<p>
"He's got em," sobbed Ruth, her handkerchief tight in
her mouth.  The Colonel could feel her trembling.
</p>
<p>
"The question to ma mind," continued the speaker,
"is not whether we <i>should</i> fight, but whether the officers
of the Army—who have failed us once, mind!—<i>will</i> fight."
</p>
<p>
The blow went home and hammered a few dissentients
into silence.
</p>
<p>
"If not then we must find our own officers—roosset-coated
captains who know what they're fighting for, and love
what they know."
</p>
<p>
The words were lost in a hurricane of cheering.
</p>
<p>
"And ma last word to you," ended the speaker, drawing
the back of his hand across his mouth, "is much that of the
Great Apostle—<i>Stand and Fight!</i>"  He flung the words
at his audience with a power and a conviction that were
overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
A great bell was tolling in the Colonel's mind.
</p>
<p>
"That's a great man," he found himself murmuring.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, that's Joe," came the deep voice beside him.
</p>
<p>
The heat, the crush, the tumult of sound, his own
intense emotion proved almost too much for the Colonel.
He leaned against the wall with closed eyes, but there was
joy in his heart.
</p>
<p>
"Done it," he muttered.  "That was England speaking."  Then
somebody led him out into the fresh air.
</p>
<p>
"They're all right, sir," said a voice comfortably in his
ear.  "Joe done the trick.  Grand he was."
</p>
<p>
Some of the Labour extremists recognised him as he
lolled against the wall, hat over his eyes, recalled his work
for the National Service League, and gathered round for the
worry.
</p>
<p>
"That's him.—Militarist!—Brought the trouble on us!
He won't pay.—Leaves that for us to do!—Drunk as a
lord!—On the blood of the workers."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel heard the words, but paid no heed.  They
fell on his mind like rain-drops on a sea which absorbs them
unconsciously as it sways and drifts listlessly to and fro.
</p>
<p>
Then another voice, familiar this time, and strangely
fierce, clashed with those of his would-be persecutors.
</p>
<p>
"None of it now!  Want one for yourself, do you?
Stand back there!  Give him a chance to breathe!  Ought
to be ashamed, some of you."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel opened his eyes to find Ernie standing over
him.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Caspar," he said faintly.
</p>
<p>
Then Ruth came swiftly out of the dissipating crowd
towards them.  She was flashing, glorious, with tumultuous
bosom.  Swept by her emotion she forgot for the moment
the undeclared war that was raging between this lean old
man and herself: she did not even notice his distress.
</p>
<p>
"He's such a battler, Joe is!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
All that was combative in the Colonel rose desperately
to grip and fight the same qualities in her.
</p>
<p>
"He's not the only one," he said feebly, and musing
with a vacuous smile on the strange medley of vast
world-tragedy and tiny domestic drama sank slowly into
unconsciousness, Ernie's arm about him, Ernie's kind face anxious
above him.  "Watch it, Caspar!" he whispered.
"Danger!"
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
He came round slowly to hear voices wrangling above
him.
</p>
<p>
"I had to come to the meeting.  I promised Joe," the
woman was saying.
</p>
<p>
"What about the children?"
</p>
<p>
There was silence: then the man went on with a cold
sneer.
</p>
<p>
"Little Alice, I suppose.  Little Alice got to do it all
these days."
</p>
<p>
"Little Alice is mine," the woman retorted.  "If you're
not satisfied with the way your—"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel sat up.
</p>
<p>
"For God's sake!" he cried.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
THE END OF THE WORLD
</h3>
<p>
The next day was Bank Holiday; and such a holiday as
no living man had known or would ever know again.  Half
the world had already tumbled into hell; and the other
half was poised breathless on the brink, awaiting the
finger-push that should send it too roaring down to death.
</p>
<p>
On that brilliant summer day nations crouched in the
stubble like coveys of partridges beneath the shadow of
some great hawk hovering far away in the blue.
</p>
<p>
A silence like a cloud enveloped England.
</p>
<p>
The tocsin was about to sound that was to call millions
of rosy lads from their mothers, splendid youths from their
girls, sober middle-aged men away from their accustomed
place in church and chapel, from the office stool, from the
warm companionable bed and the lovely music of children's
voices, to strange destinies in unknown seas, on remote
deserts, beside alien rivers; calling them in a voice that
was not to be denied to lay their bones far from the village
church-yard and the graves of innumerable ancestors, in
rotting swamps, on sun-bleached mountains, with none to
attend their obsequies save the nosing jackal and
raw-necked vulture.
</p>
<p>
Early in the morning the Colonel walked across to Old
Town to see Bobby Chislehurst, and put the curb on him
if possible; for the <i>Daily Citizen</i> had come out with a
full-page appeal to lovers of peace to attend an anti-war
demonstration in Trafalgar-square.
</p>
<p>
On his way the Colonel gleaned straws of news; and the
gleaning was not hard.  The most reserved were expansive;
the most exclusive sociable.  For the moment all barriers
of class were down.  By the time he had reached the <i>Star</i>
he was <i>au courant</i> with all the happenings, local and general.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon who, when he put his snuff-box aside,
and took the gloves off, could be really moving, had from
his hill thundered a magnificent call to arms—"purely
pagan, of course."  Mr. Trupp, whom he met, told the
Colonel, "but fine for all that."  Mr. Geddes in the plain
had answered back in an appeal which had moved many to
tears on behalf of Him, Whose sad face on the Cross looks
down on This after the passion of a thousand years.
</p>
<p>
The Fleet had gone to war-stations; the Territorials
had been mobilised.  Haldane had returned to the War
Office.
</p>
<p>
As the Colonel dropped down the steep pitch to Church-street,
under the chesnuts of the Manor-house garden, he
met a couple of toddlers climbing the hill shepherded by an
efficient little maiden of seven or eight, who smiled at him
with familiar eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Hullo, little Alice," he said.  "Where you off to so
busily with your little flock?"
</p>
<p>
"Saffrons Croft for the day—me and my little ones,"
she answered, not without a touch of self-importance.  "I
got the dinner here.  Dad and Mother's taking baby a drive
on the bus to see Granny at Auston."
</p>
<p>
She turned and waved to her mother, who was standing
at the top of Borough Lane with Ernie, amongst a little
group opposite the <i>Star</i>, where was one of the char-a-bancs
of the Touring Syndicate picking up passengers from the
Moot.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked down the hill towards them.  Ruth,
seeing him approach, climbed to her place on the char-a-banc.
Ernie handed little Ned to her, and then turned to meet
the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Givin Alf the benefit," he said, with a grin.  "Backin
the family and baptizin the bus.  Goin the long drive over
the hill to Friston and Seaford; then up the valley to
Auston.  Dinner there.  And home by Hailsham and
Langney in the evening.—I wanted her to ask Joe.  But
she wouldn't.  Fickle I call her."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel glanced up; but Ruth steadfastly refused
to meet his eye.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose one wants the family to one-salf some-times,
even a workin-woman doos," she muttered.
</p>
<p>
And the Colonel saw that Ern had made his remark to
show that the tension between him and his wife, so marked
yesterday, had eased.
</p>
<p>
"My wife's right," he thought.  "Caspar is a gentleman.
Blood <i>does</i> tell."
</p>
<p>
Just then Alf came down the steps of the Manor-house
opposite, looking smug and surly.  He crossed the road
to the char-a-banc and said a word to the driver.
</p>
<p>
Ruth leaned over, glad of the diversion.
</p>
<p>
"Ain't you comin along then, Alf?" she asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
"Caspar's my name," the Managing Director answered,
never lifting his eyes to his tormentor.
</p>
<p>
The young woman bent down roguishly, disregarding
Ern's warning glances.
</p>
<p>
"Not to your own sister, Alfie," she answered, demure
and intimate.
</p>
<p>
They were mostly Old Town folk on the char-a-banc,
many from the Moot; and they all tittered, even the driver.
</p>
<p>
Alf stood back in the road and said deliberately,
searching with his eye the top of the bus.
</p>
<p>
"Where is he, then?"
</p>
<p>
Ern flashed round on him.
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
Alf sneered.
</p>
<p>
"You!—You're only her husband!" and decamped
swiftly.
</p>
<p>
Ernie did not move.  He stood with folded arms, rather
white, following his retreating brother with his eyes.  Then
he said to the Colonel quietly,
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir.  That's Alf.  Now you know."
</p>
<p>
"I'm beginning to," said the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"And time too," came Ruth's voice cold and quivering.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
In the cool of the evening the Colonel walked down
Terminus Road.
</p>
<p>
Outside the office of Caspar's Road-Touring Syndicate
Alf was standing, awaiting the return of his argosies.  He
was scanning the evening paper and still wore the injured
and offended air of one who has a personal grievance
against his Creator and means to get his own back some
day.
</p>
<p>
"Any news, sir?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel stopped.
</p>
<p>
"Germany sent Belgium an ultimatum last night
demanding right of way.  And the King of Belgium took
the field this morning."
</p>
<p>
"Then he ought to be shot," snarled Alf.  "Provoking of
em on, I call it."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked on to the East-end, his eyes about
him, and heart rising.
</p>
<p>
The country was facing the situation with dignity and
composure.
</p>
<p>
The streets were thronged.  Everywhere men and
women gathered in knots and talked.  There was no
drunken-ness, no rioting, no Jingo manifestations—and that
though it was August Bank Holiday.  The gravity of
the situation had sobered all men.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel passed on into Seagate to find the hero of
Sunday afternoon's battle.
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt stood in his shirt-sleeves in the door of his
lodgings with folded arms and cocked chin.  His pipe was in
his mouth and he was sucking at it fiercely with turned-in
lips and inflated nostrils.
</p>
<p>
The engineer was clearly on the defensive; the Colonel
saw it at once and knew why.  On the main issue Joe had
proved fatally, irretrievably wrong.  But he had been
"on the platform" now for twenty years.  In other words
he was a politician, and in the Colonel's view no
politician ever admitted that he was wrong.  To cover his
retreat he would almost certainly resort to the correct
tactical principle of a counter-offensive.
</p>
<p>
"That was a great speech of yours, Burt," the Colonel
began.
</p>
<p>
The engineer sucked and puffed unmoved.
</p>
<p>
"We must fight," he said.  "There's no two ways
about it.  The Emperors have asked for it; and they
shall have it.  No more crowned heads!  We've had
enoof o yon truck!"
</p>
<p>
In his elemental mood accent had coarsened, phrase
become colloquial.  He took his pipe from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
"Sitha!—this'll be a fight to a finish atween the Old
Order and the New—atween what you stand for and what
A do."
</p>
<p>
"And what do I stand for?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Imperialism—Capitalism—call it what you will.  It's
the domination of the workers by brute force."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel turned a quiet eye upon him.
</p>
<p>
"Is that fair?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The engineer stuffed his pipe back into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
"Happen not of you.  Of your class, yes."  He felt he
had been on dangerous ground and came off it.  "<i>We</i> shall
fight because we must," he said.  "What about you?"
</p>
<p>
He was making a direct offensive now, and turned
full face to his adversary.
</p>
<p>
"Us?" asked the Colonel puzzled.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," retorted the other.  "The officers of the
Army?—shall you fight?"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel looked away.
</p>
<p>
Joe eyed him shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
"Last time you were asked to, you refused," he remarked.
"Said you'd resign rather.  One General said if there was
war he'd fight against England.  It was a piece in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.  A've got it pasted in ma Ammunition
Book.  Coom in and see!"
</p>
<p>
The Colonel did not move.
</p>
<p>
"I think the officers will be there or thereabouts all right
if the're wanted," he said.
</p>
<p>
Joe appeared slightly mollified.
</p>
<p>
"Well, you came out against the railway-men in 1911,"
he said.  "A will say that for you.  A wasn't sure you'd
feel same gate when it coom to Emperors."
</p>
<p>
They strolled back together to Pevensey Road; and
for the first time the Colonel actively disliked the man
at his side.  That wind of the spirit which had blown
through the engineer yesterday purging him of his dross had
passed on into the darkness.  To-day he was both
politically dishonest and sexually unclean.
</p>
<p>
In fact his life that had been rushing down the mountain
like a spate with extraordinary speed and power, confined
between narrow banks, just as it was emerging at the
estuary into the sea had met suddenly the immense weight
of the returning ocean-tide, advancing irresistible—to be
swamped, diverted, turned back on itself.  This man
once so strong, of single purpose, and not to be deflected
from it by any human power, was now spiritually for all
his bluff a tumbling mass of worry and confusion and
dirty yellow foam....
</p>
<p>
The pair had passed into the main thoroughfare.
</p>
<p>
"What about that woman?" asked the Colonel moodily.
</p>
<p>
Joe was chewing his pipe-stem.
</p>
<p>
"What woman'll that be?"
</p>
<p>
"Why the one you were talking about to me on Saturday
night,—whether you should bolt with her or not."
</p>
<p>
Joe halted on the kerb-stone and regarded the traffic
imperturbably.
</p>
<p>
"A know nowt o no such woman," he said.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel glanced at him.  Just then he heard the
sound of a horn and looking back saw one of the new
motor-char-a-bancs of the Touring Syndicate returning crowded
to the brim.  A man stood on the step with a horn and
tootled.  Ernie sat in front with Ruth, the boy in her lap
asleep against her breast.  The Colonel marked the strength
and tranquillity of her pose, her arms clasped around the
sleeping child.  Father, mother, and child were profoundly
at peace; one with each other, so it seemed to him, one
with life.  Joe took his pipe out of his mouth and pointed
with the stem.
</p>
<p>
"Yon's her," he said, with stunning impudence.
</p>
<p>
"I know that then," answered the Colonel.  "Your
own friend's wife."
</p>
<p>
Ernie who had seen Joe waved and winked and nudged
Ruth.  She could not or would not see.  Joe waved
back casually.  Then he turned to the Colonel with a
Silenus-like twinkle, his little black eyes of a bear glittering.
</p>
<p>
"He'll have to go now," he said, gurgling like an amused
baby.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel looked him in the eyes.  "Devil!" he said.
</p>
<p>
The engineer peeped up at him with something of the
chuckle of the young cuckoo.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, don't you talk, Colonel!  I'm not the only one."
</p>
<p>
"What you mean?" fiercely.
</p>
<p>
"What you told me Saturday night."
</p>
<p>
"I never betrayed my pal, whatever else."
</p>
<p>
"You would ha done," remorselessly.  "Only you lost
your nerve at the last moment.  That's nothing to boast on."
</p>
<p>
The man's brazen cynicism revolted the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you don't know me," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
"A know maself," the other answered.  "And that's
the same."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel felt as feels a man who watches the casual
immoralities of a big and jolly dog.  Then he came to
himself and broke away, firing a last shot over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose you'll wait till he has gone," he sneered.
</p>
<p>
"A doubt," the other answered, cool and impudent
to the last.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel tramped home, sore at heart.
</p>
<p>
Opposite the Wish he stumbled on Mr. Trupp, who
brought him up with a jerk.
</p>
<p>
"There's going to be a Coalition Government," the
old surgeon told his friend.  "Lloyd George and the pacifists
are leaving the Cabinet; and Smith and Carson and Bonar
Law coming in."
</p>
<p>
Just then Stanley Bessemere rushed by in a powerful
car.  He waved to the two men, neither of whom would
see him.
</p>
<p>
"You know what he's after?" said Mr. Trupp.
</p>
<p>
"What?" asked the Colonel.
</p>
<p>
"Spreading it round that Haldane's holding up
the Expeditionary Force."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel struck the ground.
</p>
<p>
"My God!" he cried.  "Party politics even at this
hour!"
</p>
<p>
The other shrugged.
</p>
<p>
"They've got to find a scape goat or take it in the neck
themselves," he said.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel walked home in the twilight along the
deserted brick-walk, under the tamarisk bank stirring gracefully
in the evening breeze.  At the extreme end of the bricks
where a path climbs up a chalk-pit to Holywell he came
on a tall dark solitary figure looking out over the sea.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Geddes.
</p>
<p>
The old soldier approached him quietly and touched
his arm.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Geddes," he said gently.  "What you
thinking of?"
</p>
<p>
The tall man turned his fine face.
</p>
<p>
"I was thinking about a carpenter," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Of Nazareth?"
</p>
<p>
"No, of Berlin.  Of Papa Schumacher and that boy
Joseph, who was trying so hard to be an English
sport—and black-eyed Joanna and the old Mutter."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel swallowed.
</p>
<p>
"Let's shake hands, Geddes," he said.
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart, Colonel," the other answered.
</p>
<p>
Then the old soldier went up the slope laboriously, his
hands upon his knees.
</p>
<p>
His wife was waiting him on the cliff, a little figure,
distinguished even in the dusk, about her shoulders the
scarlet cape that had been the gift of a Rajput Princess.
</p>
<p>
"I pray it will be all right," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I pray so," the little lady answered.
</p>
<p>
War meant ruin for her and the destruction of all her
hopes for Toby.—And her own Jock!—but she never
wavered.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br><br>
THE COLONEL
</h3>
<p>
That night Sir Edward Grey made the historic speech,
which swung the nation into line like one man, and launched
Great Britain on the supreme adventure of her history.
</p>
<p>
<i>The one bright spot in the situation is Ireland.</i>
</p>
<p>
Redmond had followed in a speech which filled the
Colonel's eyes with tears and his heart with gladness
as he read it next morning, so generous it was, so
chivalrous.
</p>
<p>
<i>I say to the Government they may withdraw every one of
their troops from Ireland.  Ireland will be defended by her
armed sons from invasion, and for that purpose Catholics in
the South will join the Protestants in the North.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Colonel paced to and fro on his lawns, the paper
flapping in his hand.
</p>
<p>
Not even the spectacle of Carson, sulking in his tent,
and answering never a word to his opponent's magnanimous
appeal, could mar that vision splendid.
</p>
<p>
All day long the Colonel never left his garden, hovering
round the telephone.  Anything might happen at any
moment.
</p>
<p>
Then news came through.
</p>
<p>
The Government had sent Germany an ultimatum.  If
she failed to give us an assurance before 11 p.m. that she
would not violate the neutrality of Belgium, England would
go to war.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel sighed his thankfulness.
</p>
<p>
All day he quarter-decked up and down the loggia,
Zeiss glasses in hand.  His telescope he arranged on the
tripod on the lawn, and with it swept earth and sky and sea.
Towards evening he marked a bevy of men swing round
the shoulder of the hill from Meads into the coombe.  They
were in mufti, and not in military formation; but they
marched, he noted, and kept some sort of order, moving
rhythmically, restrained as a pack of hounds on the way to
the meet, and yet with riot in their hearts.  He turned the
telescope full on them, marked Ernie among them, and
knew them forthwith for the Reservists from Old Town
training for <i>IT</i>.  A wave of emotion surged through him.
He went down to the fence and stood there with folded
arms, and high head, his sparse locks grey in the evening
light, watching them go by.  Then he saluted.
</p>
<p>
They saw the old soldier standing bare-headed at the
fence, recognised him, and shouted a greeting.
</p>
<p>
"Good-evening, sir."
</p>
<p>
"That's the style!" he cried gruffly.  "Getting down
to it."
</p>
<p>
Then Ernie broke away and came across the grass to
him at the double, grinning broadly, and gay as a boy.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir.  Old Town Troop we call ourselves.  Long
march to-night.  Through Birling Gap to the Haven and
home over Windhover about midnight.  What I stepped
across to say, sir, was I'm thinkin Ruth'd better stay where
she is for the time being—if it's all the same to you, sir;
and not move to the garage."
</p>
<p>
"As you like," replied the Colonel.  "Undercliff's the
most exposed house in Beachbourne—that's certain.  If
there's trouble from the sea we shall catch it; or if their
Zeppelins bomb the signalling station on the Head some
of it may come our way."
</p>
<p>
Ernie looked shy.
</p>
<p>
"That little turn-up with Alf in the road yesterday,
sir," he said confidentially.  "I was glad you was
there."  He came forward stealthily.  "See, I know what you
thought, sir.  It's not Joe after her.  It's Alf—always has
been; from before we married.  Joe's all right."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel stared grimly over the sea.
</p>
<p>
"I think you're wrong," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Then I know I'm not, sir," Ernie flashed.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The Colonel returned to his watch.
</p>
<p>
That night he did not go to bed.  Instead he sat up in
his pyjamas in the corner-room that looked out over the
sea, and on to Beau-nez.  If we went in the news would be
flashed at once to the coastguard on the Head; and the
petty officer on duty up there had promised to signal it
down to the house in the coombe beneath.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel watched and waited.
</p>
<p>
The window was open.  It was a still and brilliant
night.  He could hear the fall, and swish, and drone of the
sea, rhythmical and recurrent, at the foot of the cliff.  From
the crest of the hill behind the house came the occasional
tinkle of the canister-bell of some old wether of the flock.
</p>
<p>
Then the silence was disturbed by a growing tumult in
the darkness.
</p>
<p>
A squadron of destroyers was thrashing furiously round
the Head, not a light showing, close inshore, too, only an
occasional smudge of white in the darkness revealing their
position and the feather of foam they bore along like a plume
before them.
</p>
<p>
Out of the darkness they came at a speed incredible,
and into the darkness they were gone once more like a flash.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel breathed again.
</p>
<p>
At least the Navy was ready, thanks to Churchill.
</p>
<p>
Was the Army?
</p>
<p>
He recalled a remark reported to him as having been
made at a P.S.A. in the East-end some weeks since: that the
Army no longer trusted its officers, and the country no
longer trusted its Army.  Could it be true?
</p>
<p>
His thoughts turned with passionate sympathy to Gough
and the simple regimental officers who had been lured
by politicians into the dreadful business of the Army
Conspiracy.  But that other feller!—that yappin chap at
the War Office, who ought to have known better! ...
</p>
<p>
Away on the crest of Beau-nez, humping a huge black
back against the brilliant darkness, someone was swinging
a lantern—once, twice.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel flashed his electric torch in answer.
</p>
<p>
The gaunt figure at the window turned.
</p>
<p>
"Rachel," he said low, to the woman in the bed beneath
him.
</p>
<p>
"Jocko," came the answering voice, quiet as his own.
</p>
<p>
"We're going in."
</p>
<p>
"Thank God."
</p>
<p>
In the darkness she reached up arms, white and trembling
as a bride's, and drew him to her.
</p>
<p>
He kissed her eyelids and found them wet.
</p>
<p>
"I can't help it, Jocko," she sobbed.  "Jock!"
</p>
<p>
Her boy was in India with the second battalion; but
she knew very well that now the crash had come every
battalion in the Service would be flung into the furnace.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel went back to the window and she came to
his side.  His arm crept about her, and she trembled in the
curve of it.  A mild but ghastly beam, as of the moon,
fell on them standing at the window.  A battleship was
playing its searchlight full on them.  The cold wan beam
roamed along the hill-side callous and impersonal, exposing
every bush and scar.  It fell on the white bluff of
Beau-nez and came creeping, like the fingers of a leper,
along the cliff.  Just opposite the hostel, at the spot where
the path ran down to the beach, it stayed, pointing as it
were, at a little pillar of solid blackness erect on the cliff
edge.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel caught his breath with a gasp.
</p>
<p>
"Don't look!" he cried sharply and snatched his wife
away.  As he did so the pillar broke up in two component
parts, as though dissolved by the white encircling flood of
light.
</p>
<p>
A woman's stifled scream came through the open window.
</p>
<p>
"Joe!"
</p>
<p>
Then there was a slither of chalk as the pair stampeded
down the path out of sight, and crashed into the beach
beneath.  The Colonel let down the blind with a rattle.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
<br><br>
THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT
</h3>
<p>
Ernie clattered into the kitchen at a busy trot, and stumbled
upstairs without a word to his wife at the sink.
</p>
<p>
There was such an air of stir and secret purposefulness about
him that Ruth followed him up to the bedroom.  There
she found him on his knees in a litter of things, packing a
bundle frantically.
</p>
<p>
A dish-cloth in her hand, she watched his efforts.
</p>
<p>
"Where away then?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Berlin this journey.  Hand me them socks!"
</p>
<p>
Her eyes leapt.  "Is it war?"
</p>
<p>
"That's it."
</p>
<p>
She sat down ghastly, wrapping her hands in her apron
as if they had been mutilated and she wished to hide the
stumps.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Men abuse the Army when they are in it and take their
discharge at the earliest possible moment; but when the
call comes they down tools with avidity, and leaving the mill,
the mine, the shunting yard, and the shop, they troop back
to the colours with the lyrical enthusiasm of those who have
re-discovered youth on the threshhold of middle-age.
</p>
<p>
Ern, you may be sure, was no exception to the rule.
</p>
<p>
Packing and unpacking his bundle on his knees, he was
busy, happy, important.  But there was no such desperate
hurry after all: for he did not join the crowds which
thronged the recruiting stations in those first days: he
waited for the Colonel to arrange matters so that he could
join his old battalion at Aldershot direct.
</p>
<p>
Ruth watched him with deep and jealously guarded eyes
in which wistfulness and other disturbing emotions met
and mingled.
</p>
<p>
Once only she put to him the master question.
</p>
<p>
"What about us, Ern?"
</p>
<p>
He was standing at the time contemplating the patient
and tormented bundle.
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"Me and the children."
</p>
<p>
"There's one Above," said Ernie.  "He'll see to you."
</p>
<p>
"He don't most in general not from what I've seen of
it," answered Ruth.  "What if He don't?"
</p>
<p>
There was a moment's pause.  Then Ern dropped a
word as a child may drop a stone in a well.
</p>
<p>
"Joe."
</p>
<p>
Ruth caught her breath.
</p>
<p>
In those days Ernie grew on her as a mountain looming
out of the dawn-mist grows on the onlooker.  Joe did not
even come to see her; and she was glad.  For all his virility
and bull-like quality, now that the day of battle had come,
Ern was proving spiritually the bigger man.
</p>
<p>
And his very absorbtion in the new venture appealed
to Ruth even while it wounded.  Ern had been "called" as
surely as Clem Woolgar, the bricklayer's labourer, her
neighbour in the Moot, who testified every Sunday afternoon
in a scarlet jersey at the <i>Star</i> corner to the clash of cymbals.
Clem it was true, spoke of his call as Christ; to Ernie it went
by the name of country.  In Ruth's view the name might
differ but the Thing was the same.  A voice had come to
Ern which had spoken to him as she had not, as the children
had not.  Because of it he was a new man—"converted,"
as Clem would say, prepared to forsake father and mother,
and wife, and child, and follow, follow.
</p>
<p>
England was calling; and he seemed deaf to every
other voice.  She seemed to have gone clean out of his life;
but the children had not—she noticed it with a pang of
jealousy and a throb of hope.  For each of the remaining
nights after dark, he went round their cots.  She was not
to know anything about that, she could see, from the stealthy
way in which he stole upstairs when her back was supposed
to be turned.  But the noises in the room overhead, the
murmur of his voice, the shuffling of his feet as he got up
from the bedsides betrayed his every action.
</p>
<p>
On the third night, as he rejoined her, she rose before
him in the dusk, laying down her work.
</p>
<p>
"Anything for me too, Ern," she asked humbly—"the
mother of em?"
</p>
<p>
"What d'you mean?" he asked almost fiercely.
</p>
<p>
"D'you want me, Ern?"
</p>
<p>
He turned his back on her with an indifference that hurt
far more than any brutality, because it signified so plainly
that he did not care.
</p>
<p>
"You're all right," he said enigmatically, and went out.
</p>
<p>
He could ask anything of her now, and she would give
him all, how gladly!  But he asked nothing.
</p>
<p>
In another way, too, he was torturing her.  It was
clear to her that he meant to do his duty by her and the
children—to the last ounce; and nothing more.  He cared
for their material wants as he had never done before.  All
his spare moments he spent handying about the house,
hammer in hand, nails in mouth, doing little jobs he had
long promised to do and had forgotten; putting little Ned's
mail-cart to rights, screwing on a handle, setting a loose
slate.  She followed him about with wistful eyes, holding
the hammer, steadying the ladder, and receiving in return
a few off-hand words of thanks.  She did not want words:
she wanted him—himself.
</p>
<p>
Then news came through, and he was straightway full
of mystery and bustle.
</p>
<p>
"Join at Aldershot to-morrow.  Special train at two,"
he told Ruth in the confidential whisper beloved of
working-men.  "Don't say nothing to nobody."  As though the
news, if it reached the Kaiser, would profoundly affect the
movements of the German armies.
</p>
<p>
That evening Ernie went up to the Manor-house to say
good-bye.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp was far more to him than his god-mother:
she was a friend known to him from babyhood, allied to
him by a thousand intimate ties, and trusted as he trusted
no one else on earth, not even his dad.
</p>
<p>
Now he unbosomed to her the one matter that was
worrying him on his departure—that he should be leaving
Ruth encumbered with debt.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp met him with steady eyes.  It was her first
duty, the first duty of every man, woman and child in the
nation to see that the fighting-men went off in good heart.
</p>
<p>
"You needn't worry about Ruth," she said, quietly.
"She'll have the country behind her.  All the soldiers'
wives will."
</p>
<p>
Ernie shook his head doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, I don't hold much by the country," he said.
</p>
<p>
The lady's grave face, silver-crowned, twinkled into
sudden mischievous life.  She rippled off into the delicious
laughter he loved so dearly.
</p>
<p>
"I know who's been talking to you!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
Ernie grinned sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
"Who then?"
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Burt."
</p>
<p>
Ernie admitted the charge.
</p>
<p>
"If you don't trust the country, will you trust Mr. Trupp
and me?" the other continued.
</p>
<p>
Ernie rose with a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you kindly, 'm," he said.  "That's what I
come after."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Ernie went on to Rectory Walk, to find that his mother
too had joined the crucified.  In the maelstrom of emotion
that in those tragic hours was tossing nations and individuals
this way and that, the hard woman had been humbled at
last.  Stripped to the soul, she saw herself a twig hurled
about in the sea of circumstance she could no more control
than a toy-boat a-float on the Atlantic can order the tides.
No longer an isolated atom hard and self-contained, she was
one of a herd of bleating sheep being driven by a remorseless
butcher to the slaughter-house.  And the first question
she put to him revealed the extent of the change that had
been wrought in her.
</p>
<p>
"What about Ruth?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
It was the only occasion on which his mother had named
his wife to Ern during his married life.
</p>
<p>
"She's all right, mother," Ernie replied.  "She's plenty
of friends."
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Trupp," jealously.  "Well, why don't ye say so?
What about the children?"
</p>
<p>
"They'll just stay with their mother," answered Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"I could have em here if she was to want to go out to
work," Anne said grudgingly; and must add, instigated
by the devil who dogged her all her life—"Your children,
of course."
</p>
<p>
Ernie answered quite simply:
</p>
<p>
"No, thank-you, mother," and continued with
unconscious dignity—"They're all my children."
</p>
<p>
A gleam of cruelty shone in his mother's eyes.
</p>
<p>
"She's behind with her rent.  You know that?  And
Alf's short.  He says he's dropped thousands over his
Syndicate.  Ruined in his country's cause, Alf says."
</p>
<p>
"If he's dropped thousands a few shillings more or less
won't help him," said Ernie curtly.
</p>
<p>
"And yet he'll want em," Anne pursued maliciously.
"He was sayin so only last night.  <i>Every penny</i>, he said."
</p>
<p>
"He may want," retorted Ernie.  "He won't get."
</p>
<p>
His mother made a little grimace.
</p>
<p>
"If Alf wants a thing he usually gets it."
</p>
<p>
Ernie flashed white.
</p>
<p>
"Ah," he said.  "We'll see what dad says."
</p>
<p>
It was a new move in the family game, and unexpected.
Anne was completely taken a-back.  She felt that Ernie
was not playing fair.  There had always been an unwritten
family law, inscribed by the mother on the minds of the
two boys in suggestible infancy, that dad should be left
outside all broils and controversies; that dad should be
spared unpleasantness, and protected at any cost.
</p>
<p>
She was shocked, almost to pleading.
</p>
<p>
"You'd never tell him!"
</p>
<p>
"He's the very one I would tell then!" retorted Ernie,
rejoicing in his newly-discovered vein of brutality.
</p>
<p>
"Only worry him," she coaxed.
</p>
<p>
"He ain't the only one," Ern answered.  "I'm fairly
up against it, too."  Grinning quietly at his victory, he
turned down the passage to the study.
</p>
<p>
His father was sitting in his favourite spot under the
picture of his ancestor, watching the tree-tops blowing in
the Rectory garden opposite.  The familiar brown-paper-clad
New Testament was on his knee.
</p>
<p>
Ernie marked at once that here was the one tranquil
spirit he had met since the declaration of war.  And this
was not the calm of stagnation.  Rather it was the intense
quiet of the wheel which revolves so swiftly that it appears
to be still.
</p>
<p>
He drew his chair beside his father's.
</p>
<p>
"What d'you make of it all, dad?" he asked gently.
</p>
<p>
The old man took his thumb out of his New Testament,
and laid his hand upon his son's.
</p>
<p>
"<i>And behold there was a great earthquake,</i>" he quoted.
"<i>For the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came
and rolled back the stone from the door of the Tomb.</i>"
</p>
<p>
Ernie nodded thoughtfully.  For the first time perhaps
the awful solemnity of the drama in which he was about to
play his part came home to him in all its overwhelming
power.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, dad," he said deeply.  "Only I reck'n it took
some rolling."
</p>
<p>
The old man gripped and kneaded the hand in his just
as Ruth would do in moments of stress.
</p>
<p>
"True, Boy-lad," he answered.  "But it had to be
rolled away before the Lord could rise."
</p>
<p>
Ernie assented.
</p>
<p>
Hand-in-hand they sat together for some while.  Then
Ernie rose to go.  In the silence and dusk father and son
stood together on the very spot where fourteen years before
they had said good-bye on Ernie's departure for the Army.
The Edward Caspar of those days was old now; and the
boy of that date a matured man, scarred already by the
wars of Time.
</p>
<p>
"It won't be easy rolling back the stone, Boy-lad,"
said the old man.  "But they that are for us are more than
they that are against us."
</p>
<p>
It was not often that Ernie misunderstood his father;
but he did now.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said.  "And they say the Italians are
coming in too."
</p>
<p>
"The whole world must come in," replied the other,
his cheeks rosying faintly with an enthusiasm which made
him tremble.  "And we must all push together."  He made
a motion with his hand—"English and Germans, Russians
and Austrians, and roll it back, back, back! and topple
it over into the abyss.  And then the Dawn will break
on the risen Lord."
</p>
<p>
Ernie went out into the passage.  His mother in the
kitchen was waiting for him.  She looked almost forlorn,
he noticed.
</p>
<p>
"Give me a kiss, Ern," she pleaded in sullen voice that
quavered a little.  "Don't let's part un-friends just
now—you and me—After all, you're my first."
</p>
<p>
Ernie's eyes filled.  He took her in his arms, this withered
old woman, patted her on the back, kissed her white hair,
her tired eyelids.
</p>
<p>
"There!" he said.  "I should knaw you arter all these
years, Mum.  Always making yourself twice the terror you
are—and not meaning it."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
<br><br>
BEAU-NEZ
</h3>
<p>
He returned to the Moot to find little Alice crying in the
door.  A pathetic little shrimp of a creature she looked,
huddled against the door-post, her face hidden, her shoulders
quivering, her back to the hostile world.  Some children
who had been mocking her drew away on Ernie's approach.
</p>
<p>
"What's up, Lal?" he asked tenderly, bending over her.
</p>
<p>
She would not look up.
</p>
<p>
"It's nothing, daddy," she sobbed and crept away up
the street, like a wounded animal.
</p>
<p>
Ernie went in.  Ruth was sitting alone in the kitchen
forlorn and wistful as he had never known her.  It was
clear to him that the sorrow, whatever it might be, was
shared by mother and daughter.  He watched her
quietly for a minute; then came to her.
</p>
<p>
"What is it, mother?" he asked with unusual gentleness.
</p>
<p>
His tone touched the spring of tears in her heart.  She bit
her lip.
</p>
<p>
"Its Alf," she said with gasps.  "He's been settin em
on to her again...  He's spiteful because the war's
spoilt his Syndicate...  So he takes it out of her...
They've been tormenting her...  Only she wouldn't
tell you because she wanted your last day to be happy."
</p>
<p>
Ern went out, found little Alice once again in the door,
her pinafore still to her eyes, took her up in his arms and
put her in her mother's lap.
</p>
<p>
"Love one another," he said huskily.  "And don't
forget me."
</p>
<p>
Then he went out again, burning his battle-flare.
</p>
<p>
In half an hour he was back with Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
There was a strange hushed dignity about him as he
entered the kitchen.  He might have been a priest about
to conduct a ceremony at the altar of the Most High.  Joe
lagged behind sullen and with downward eyes, twisting
his cap.  Somehow he looked strangely common beside
his friend.  Ruth, as she rose to meet the two men, was
profoundly conscious of the contrast between them.
</p>
<p>
"Joe," said Ernie, still and solemn, "I bequeath Ruth
to you..."
</p>
<p>
In a flash the woman seized the situation.
</p>
<p>
"—to have and to hold," she murmured quietly, her head
down to stifle sobs and laughter.
</p>
<p>
Ernie with that love of ritual which characterises his
class continued with the smile-less intensity of a child.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, to have and to hold ... her and her
children ... for me ... till I return."
</p>
<p>
Joe was obviously staggered.  His eyes roved the
floor; his head weaved to and fro.
</p>
<p>
"Here, I didn't bargain for this," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
Ruth thrust out her hand almost sternly, as though to
silence him.  He took it grudgingly, and then Ern's.
</p>
<p>
"A suppose A'll do ma best," he said, and slouched out
hasty as a schoolboy escaping from the schoolroom.
</p>
<p>
When he was gone Ruth laid both hands on Ernie's
shoulders and looked at him her eyes dazzled with laughter
and tears.
</p>
<p>
"You should never ha done it, Ern!" she said.  "Never!"
</p>
<p>
"There was nothing for it only that," Ern answered
sturdily.  "It's a world of wolves.  Somebody must see
to you while I'm away."
</p>
<p>
She withdrew her hands and stood before him, defenceless
now, humble, beautiful, appealing.
</p>
<p>
"Ern," she said with a little sob, "will you take me up
along to the Ambush—our last night and all?"
</p>
<p>
He looked at her steadily.  Then he caught her hand.
</p>
<p>
"All right, old lass," he said.
</p>
<p>
They had not visited their couching-place that summer
and the romance of old and intimate association was on them
both now as they came to the tryst in the scented dusk.
The gorse, unpruned, had grown over the track that led to
the heart of the covert.  Ernie forced his way through,
Ruth following him, anchored jealously to his hand.  Behind
her the bushes closed, blocking the way; and she was glad.
Her eyes were on the shoulders of her man, wistful still
but triumphant; and she found herself smiling secretly as
she marked how bride-like she felt, how warm and shy and
tremulous.  In this great hour the tides of her ebbing youth
had returned with power and the desert bloomed afresh.
The world-catastrophe had wrought a miracle.  Spring had
quickened the stale summer air.  Here at the parched noon
was a hint of dawn, dew-drenched and lovely.
</p>
<p>
Waist-deep in the dark covert, the man and woman
stood on the summit of the hill, under the sky, the sea spread
like a dulled shield beneath them.
</p>
<p>
It was already nine o'clock; a perfect evening of that
never-to-be-forgotten August.  The sun had long gone
down behind the Seven Sisters.  In Paradise a nightjar
was thrumming harshly.  Below in the coombe the lights
of Undercliff began to twinkle.  On the Head Brangwyn-like
figures were moving heavily.  A night-shift was working
there behind windy flares, screened by tarpaulins from
enemy eyes at sea.  Ernie knew what they were doing.
</p>
<p>
"They're building a battery to protect the new wireless
station against aircraft attack," he told Ruth.  "That
dark thing in the road's a fire-engine to dowse the flares if
a night attack's made."
</p>
<p>
Then above the noise of the navvies busy with pick and
shovel, and the pleasant gargle of the night-jar, blended
another sound.  A hollow ominous rumbling like the
voice of a great ghost laughing harshly in his grave
came rolling across the sea out of the darkness.
</p>
<p>
"Guns," said Ernie.  "They're at it in the Bight."
</p>
<p>
Ruth drew closer and took his arm.  One finger was to
her lips.  She was a little bit afraid.  He felt it, and pressed
her arm.
</p>
<p>
From the distance, muffled by the shoulder of the hill,
came the hammer-hammer that would endure all night
of the emergency gangs, rushed down in special trains from
the North, to run up a huge camp in the great coombe at
the end of Rectory Walk where of old lambs had often
roused Ernie as a lad on bleak March mornings by their
forlorn music of spirits exiled and crying for home.
</p>
<p>
He stood and looked and listened.
</p>
<p>
"Who'd ever ha beleft it'd ha come to this when we first
lay out here six years ago?" he mused.
</p>
<p>
"Or now for that matter," answered Ruth, her voice deep
and hushed as the evening.  "All so good and quiet as it
looks."
</p>
<p>
She pulled him down into the darkness of the covert.
</p>
<p>
"D'is safer here, I reck'n," she said, and nuzzled up
against him.
</p>
<p>
Ernie peeped though the gorse at the lights flickering
on the Head.
</p>
<p>
"They ca-a-n't see us here," he said.
</p>
<p>
"And a good job, too, I reck'n," answered Ruth sedately,
fingering her hair.
</p>
<p>
Ernie chuckled.
</p>
<p>
"Listen!" he said.
</p>
<p>
They sat close in their ambush, walled about with
prickly darkness, roofed in by the living night.
</p>
<p>
Beneath them the sea came and went, rose and fell,
rhythmical and somnolent, as it had done in the days when
badger and wolf and bear roamed the hill, with none to
contest their sovereignty but the hoary old sea-eagle from
the cliffs; as it might still do when man had long passed
away.  Sounds ancient almost as the earth on which they lay,
which had lulled them and millions of their forefathers to
sleep, were crossed by others, new, man-made, discordant.
</p>
<p>
Down the road at the back of the covert, not a hundred
yards away, came a sudden bustling phut-phut-phut.
</p>
<p>
"Despatch-rider," said Ernie, peering.  "Light out
and all.  Rushin it to Birling Gap.  There's a company of
Territorials there, diggin emselves in behind barbed wire
to guard the deep-sea cables."
</p>
<p>
"The Boy-Scouts were layin out all day on the road to
Friston, Mr. Chislehurst told me," remarked Ruth.  "They
took the number of every motor and motor-bike on the road
to Newhaven."
</p>
<p>
She unloosed her hair that fell about her like a torrent
of darkness.
</p>
<p>
A huge beetle twanged by above them; and then in
the covert close at hand there was a snuffling and grunting,
so loud, so close, so portentous that Ruth, creature of the
earth though she was, was startled and paused in her
undoing.
</p>
<p>
"What-ever's that?" she asked, laying a hand on Ernie.
</p>
<p>
"Hedge-pig, I allow."
</p>
<p>
"Sounds like it might be a wild boar routin and snoutin
and carryin on," she laughed.
</p>
<p>
Ruth reclined on the bed of sand.  The calm blessedness
of night embraced her; and the stars lay on her face.
She lifted her lips to them, seeming to draw them down
with each breath, and blow them away again, babe-like.
A dreamy amazement still possessed her.
</p>
<p>
"Who'd ever ha beleft it?" she said quietly.
</p>
<p>
Then she turned her face to him and laughed.
</p>
<p>
"Ernie!" she called.
</p>
<p>
"Whose are you now?" he said fiercely in her ear.
</p>
<p>
She chuckled and gathered him to her bosom.
</p>
<p>
He sighed his content.
</p>
<p>
"That's better," he murmured.  "Now, never no
more of it!"
</p>
<p>
A great mate, Ruth was a still greater mother; and
this living, pulsing creature in her arms was her child, her
first-born cub.
</p>
<p>
In the stress and conflict of the last few years necessity
had compelled her to discard the royal indolence that was
her natural habit.  The lioness in her, roused by conflict,
had made her fierce and formidable in any battle.  Six
months ago she had fought Ernie—because he was weak;
now she would shield him—because he was strong.
</p>
<p>
Jealously she pressed him to her.
</p>
<p>
"They shan't get you, my lad," she said between her
teeth.  "I'll see to that."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not afraid o them," answered Ernie drowsily.
"I knaw the Germans.  All you got to do is to say Shoo!—and
goo with your arms and they're off like rabbits from
the garden."
</p>
<p>
She thrust his head back till she saw it as a dim blob
against the shining night; and looked up into his eyes, her
own so close to his, so deep, so dear.
</p>
<p>
"You're my soldier," she murmured in his ear.  "I
always knew you was."
</p>
<p>
Then she drew his face down to hers, till their lips met.
</p>
<p>
"I got something to tell you, Ern."
</p>
<p>
Now she leaned over him.  The moon shone on the
smooth sweep of her shoulders, rounded and luminous.
</p>
<p>
"I only deceived you the once, Ern," she whispered,
her voice murmuring like a stream that issued from the
slowly-heaving ocean of her chest.  "Afore we were
married.  He ne'er wrote me ne'er a letter."
</p>
<p>
"I knew that then," muttered Ernie, sleepily, his head
beside her own.
</p>
<p>
"It was Madame," Ruth continued.  "She come over
in a car and told the tale."
</p>
<p>
Her confession made she waited; but in a moment his
breathing told her that he had fallen off to sleep.
</p>
<p>
She stroked him rhythmically, just as she would her
children when they were tired.
</p>
<p>
He was going back to the regiment—to Captain Royal—to
the Unknown.  She was not afraid for him—nor for
herself—nor for the children.  An immense peace had fallen
on her.
</p>
<p>
Then all about her a murmur as of wings grew.  There
was a whispering patter as of rain upon the turf that ringed
the covert; but no rain fell.  Through the patter came the
tinkle of a bell.  An immense flock of sheep was rippling
dimly like a flood over the parched turf to the dew-pond
by the old wall on the brow.  The whisper grew louder,
as though the rain had turned to hail.  The flock was
crossing the road.  Then there was almost a silence, and in
the silence the leader ba-a-a-d.  The flock had reached the
waters of refreshing.
</p>
<p>
Ruth slept, strangely comforted.

CHAPTER XXXIV
<br><br>
THE STATION
</h3>
<p>
Next day Ernie was to join up.
</p>
<p>
After dinner he kissed Susie and Jenny, gave them each
a penny, and despatched them to play.  Hand in hand
they stamped away to Motcombe Garden with clacking
heels, roguish backward glances and merry tongues.
</p>
<p>
Then he asked Ruth to go into the backyard.  Left
alone with Alice he lifted her on to the kitchen-table, took
her hands in his, and looked gravely into her eyes.
</p>
<p>
"I trust you to look after mother and the little ones
when I'm gone, Lal," he said.
</p>
<p>
The little maid, swift and sympathetic as her mother,
nodded at him, nibbling her handkerchief, her heart too full
for words.  Then she raised her crumpled face, that at the
moment was so like her mother's, for a last kiss, and as
she wreathed her arms round his neck she whispered,
</p>
<p>
"You are my daddy, aren't you, daddy?"
</p>
<p>
"Of course I am," he murmured, and lifted her down.
</p>
<p>
She ran away swiftly, not trusting herself to look back.
</p>
<p>
A moment later Ruth entered the kitchen, slowly and
with downcast eyes.  He was standing before the fire,
awaiting her.
</p>
<p>
"Ruth," he said quietly.  "I've tried to do well by
your child; I'll ask you to do the same by mine."
</p>
<p>
She came to him and hung about his neck, riven with
sobs, her head on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"O Ern!" she cried.  "And is that your last word
to me?"
</p>
<p>
She lifted anguished eyes to him and clung to him.
</p>
<p>
"I love them all just the same, only we been through
so much together, she and me.  That's where it is."
</p>
<p>
His arms were about her and he was stroking her.
</p>
<p>
"I knaw that then," he said, husky himself.
</p>
<p>
"See, they got you and each other and all the world,"
Ruth continued.  "Little Alice got nobody only her mother."
</p>
<p>
"And me," said Ernie.
</p>
<p>
She steadied and drew her hand across rain-blurred
eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Ern," she said, deeply.  "I do thank you for all your
lovin kindness to that child.  I've never forgot that all
through—whatever it seemed."
</p>
<p>
"She's mine just as well as yours," he answered, smiling
and uncertain.  "Always has been.  Always will be."
</p>
<p>
She pressed her lips on his with a passion that amazed
him.
</p>
<p>
Then he took the boy from the cot and rocked him.
The tears poured down his face.  This, then, was War!—All
his light-heartedness, his detachment, had gone.  He
was a husband and a father torn brutally away from the
warmth and tenderness of the home that was so dear to
him, to be tossed into the arena among wild beasts who not
long since had been men just like himself, and would be men
still but for the evil power of their masters to do by them
as his masters had done by him.  Then he put the child
back and turned to say good-bye to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The passionate wife of a few minutes since had changed
now into the mother parting from her schoolboy.  She took
him to her heart and hugged him.
</p>
<p>
"You'll be back before you know," she told him, cooing,
comforting, laughing through her tears.  "They all say it'll
be over soon, whatever else.  A great war like this ca'an't
go on.  Too much of it, like."
</p>
<p>
"Please God, so," said Ernie.  "It's going to be the
beginning of a new life for me—for you—for all of us, as
Joe says....  God keep you till we meet again."
</p>
<p>
Then he walked swiftly down the street with swimming
eyes.
</p>
<p>
The neighbours, who were all fond of Ern, stood in their
doors and watched him solemnly.
</p>
<p>
He was going into <i>IT</i>.
</p>
<p>
Like as not they would never see him again.
</p>
<p>
Many of the women had handkerchieves to their lips,
as they watched, and over the handkerchieves their eyes
showed awed.  Some turned away, hands to their hearts.
Others munched their aprons and wept.  A mysterious
rumour in the deeps of them warned them of the horror
that had him and them and the world in its grip.
</p>
<p>
They could not understand, but they could feel.
</p>
<p>
And this working man with the uncertain mouth and
blurred eyes—this man whose walk, whose speech, whose
coal-grimed face, and the smell even of his tarry clothes,
was so familiar to them—was the symbol of it all.
</p>
<p>
A big navvy came sheepishly out of the last house in
the row and stopped him.  It was the man who had
insulted Ernie in the <i>Star</i> six months before.
</p>
<p>
"I ask your pardon, Ern," he said.  "I didn't mean
what I said."
</p>
<p>
Ern shook hands.  Years before the two had been at
school together under Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
"It wasn't you, Reube," he said.  "I knaw who spread
the dung you rolled in."
</p>
<p>
"I shan't be caught again," replied the other.  "That's
a sure thing."
</p>
<p>
Ern jerked a thumb over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"Keep an eye to her!" he whispered.
</p>
<p>
"You may lay to it," the big man answered.
</p>
<p>
At the corner a young girl of perhaps fifteen ran out
suddenly, flung herself into his arms, kissed him, with blind
face lifted to the sky, and was gone again.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom of Borough Lane a troop of Boy-Scouts
in slouch hats, knickers, and with staves, drawn up in order,
saluted.  A tiny boy in his mother's arms blew him shy
kisses.  Just outside the yard of the Transport Company
his mates, who had been waiting him, came out and shook
him by the hand.  Most were very quiet.  As he passed on
the man among them he disliked most called for three cheers.
A ragged noise was raised behind him.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
At the <i>Star</i> corner a beery patriot, wearing the South
African medals, mug to his lips, hailed him.
</p>
<p>
"Gor bless the Hammer-men!" he cried.  "Gor bless
the old ridgiment!" and tried to lure Ernie into the
familiar bar-parlour.
</p>
<p>
"Not me, thank ye!" cried Ernie stoutly.  "This
ain't a beano, my boy!  This is War!"
</p>
<p>
As he rounded the corner he glanced up at the sturdy
old church with its tiny extinguisher spire, standing on the
Kneb behind him, four-square to the centuries, the symbol
of the rough and ready England which at that moment was
passing away, with its glories and its shames, into the limbo
of history.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
At the station all that was most representative in
Beachbourne had gathered to see the reservists off.
</p>
<p>
The Mayor was there in his chain of office; the Church
Militant in the person of the Archdeacon; Mr. Glynde, the
senior member for Beachbourne, middle-aged, swarthy, his
hair already white, making a marked contrast to his
junior colleague, the fair-haired young giant, talking to
the Archdeacon.
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman looked ghastly; his face colourless
save for the shadows of death which emphasised his pallor.
Then he saw Bobby Chislehurst busy among the departing
soldiers, and beckoned him austerely.
</p>
<p>
"I thought you were a pacifist, Chislehurst!" he said,
his smile more kindly and less histrionic than usual.
</p>
<p>
"So I am, sir," answered Bobby, brightly.  "But
there are several of our men from the Moot going off.  It's
not their fault they've got to go, poor beggars!"
</p>
<p>
"Their <i>fault</i>!" cried the Archdeacon.  "It's their
privilege."  He added less harshly, "We must all stand by
the country now, Chislehurst."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir," said Bobby.  "I shan't give the show
away," and he bustled off.
</p>
<p>
Then the Colonel stalked up.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Archdeacon, what d'you make of it all?" he
asked, curious as a child to gather impressions.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon drew himself up.
</p>
<p>
"Just retribution," he answered in voice that seemed
to march.  "If a nation will go a-whoring after false gods
in the wilderness what can you expect?  Gahd does not
forget."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel listened blankly, his long neck elongated
like a questing schoolboy.
</p>
<p>
"What you mean?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Welsh Disestablishment Bill," the other answered
curtly.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp now entered the station, and the Colonel,
who though quiet outwardly, was in a condition of intense
spiritual exaltation that made him restless as dough in which
the yeast is working, joined his pal.  He had cause for his
emotion.  The Cabinet had stood.  The country had closed
its ranks in a way that was little short of a miracle.  All
men of all parties had rallied to the flag.  In Dublin the Irish
mob which had provoked the King's Own Scottish Borderers
to bloody retaliation, had turned out and cheered the
battalion as it marched down to the transports for
embarkation.
</p>
<p>
"Well, we're roused at last," said the Colonel, as he
looked round on that humming scene.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Mr. Trupp.  "It's taken a bash in
the face to do it though."
</p>
<p>
"Should be interesting," commented the Colonel, hiding
his emotion behind an air of detachment.  "An undisciplined
horde of men who believe themselves to be free
against a disciplined mass of slaves."
</p>
<p>
Just then Mr. Pigott approached.  The old Nonconformist
had about him the air of a boy coming up to the desk
to take his punishment.  He was at once austere and
chastened.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Colonel," he said.  "You were right."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel took the other's hand warmly.
</p>
<p>
"Not a bit of it!" he cried.  "That's the one blessed
thing about the whole situation.  <i>We've all been wrong</i>.
I believed in the German menace—till a month or two
ago.  And then...."
</p>
<p>
"That's it," said Mr. Trupp.  "We must all swing
together, and a good job too.  If there's any hanging done
Carson and Bonar Law, Asquith and Haldane, Ramsay
Macdonald and Snowden ought to grace the same gallows
seems to me.  And when we've hanged our leaders for
letting us in we must hang ourselves for allowing them to
let us in."
</p>
<p>
The old surgeon had turned an awkward corner with the
gruff tact peculiar to him; and Mr. Pigott at least was
grateful to him.
</p>
<p>
"You've heard Carson's committed suicide?" he said.
"Shot himself this morning on St. Stephen's Green."
</p>
<p>
"Not a bit of it," replied the Colonel.  "He's far too
busy holding up recruiting in Ulster while he haggles for
his terms, to do anything so patriotic."
</p>
<p>
"Besides why should he?" interposed a harsh and jeering
voice.  "Treason's all right if you're rich and powerful.
Jim Larkin got six months a year ago for sedition
and inciting to violence.  What'll these chaps get for
provoking the greatest war that ever was or will be?
I'll tell ye, <i>Fat jobs</i>.  Where'll they be at the end of
the war? under the sod alongside the millions of
innocent men who've had to pay the price of their
mistakes?  No fear!  They'll be boolgin money, oozin
smiles, fat with power, and big-bellied wi feedin on the
carcases of better men."
</p>
<p>
It was Joe Burt who had come up with Mr. Geddes.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, giving his shoulder to the engineer, turned
to the tall minister, who was stiff, a little self-conscious,
and very grave.
</p>
<p>
Possessed of a far deeper mind than Mr. Pigott,
Mr. Geddes was still haunted by doubts.  Were we wholly in
the right?
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, intuitive as a girl, recognised the other's
distress, and guessed the cause of it.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Geddes," he said gently.  "Evil has triumphed
for the moment at least."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied the other.  "Liebknecht's shot, they say."
</p>
<p>
"All honour to him!" said the Colonel.  "He was the
one man of the lot who stood to his guns when the pinch
came.  All the rest of the Social Democrats stampeded
at the first shot."
</p>
<p>
Joe Burt edged up again.  Like Mr. Pigott he had made
his decision irrevocably and far sooner than the old
Nonconformist; but there was a vengeful background still
to his thoughts.  He refused to forget.
</p>
<p>
"I hear the Generals are in uproarious spirits," he said.
</p>
<p>
"One of them," answered the Colonel quietly.
</p>
<p>
"They won't pay the price," continued Joe.  "They'll
make—trust them.  <i>There's</i> the man they'll leave to take
the punishment they've brought on the coontry."  He
nodded to Ernie who was busy with some mates extracting
chocolates from a penny-in-the-slot-machine.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel's eye glittered.  He had spied Stanley
Bessemere doing, indeed over-doing, the hearty amongst
the men by the barrier.
</p>
<p>
"After all it's nothing to what we owe our friend there
and the politicians," he said brightly, and made towards
his victim, with an almost mincing motion.
</p>
<p>
Since the declaration of war his solitary relief from
intolerable anxieties had been baiting the junior member
for the Borough.  He left him no peace, hanging like a
gadfly on his flank.  At the club, in the street, on committees
at the Town-hall there rose up to haunt the young man this
inexorable spectre with the death's head, the courteous
voice, and the glittering smile.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Bessemere!" he said gently.  "Here still!—I
heard you had enlisted, you and Smith."
</p>
<p>
The other broke away and, seeing Ernie close by, shook
hands with him.  The move was unfortunately countered
by Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
"You've shook 'ands with Mr. Caspar five times since
I've been here," he remarked tartly.  "Can't you give
somebody else a turn now?"
</p>
<p>
Just then, mercifully, Mr. Trupp rolled up, coughing.
</p>
<p>
Summer or winter made no difference to the great man's
cold, which was always with him, and lovingly cherished;
but he liked to mark the change between the two seasons
by exchanging the long woollen muffler of winter for a silken
wrapper in which he swaddled his neck in the summer
months.
</p>
<p>
"Good luck, Ernie," he said in his brief way, his eyes
shrewd and sweet behind his pince-nez.
</p>
<p>
"Keep an eye to Ruth, won't you, sir?" said Ernie
in his most confidential manner.
</p>
<p>
"We'll do our best," replied the other hoarsely.  "Here's
Mr. Pigott.  Quite a jingo these days."
</p>
<p>
"Who isn't?" the old school-master answered with an
attempt at the familiar truculence.  "Well, you look like it,
Ern."  He added almost with admiration.  "Quite a
changed man."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Then the Colonel joined the little group.
</p>
<p>
"Coming along sir?" asked Ernie keenly.
</p>
<p>
"No luck," replied the other gloomily.  "Too old at
sixty...  What about that brother of yours?"
</p>
<p>
Ern's face darkened.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, I ain't seen him," he said.
</p>
<p>
"There he is by the bookstall," muttered Mr. Pigott.
"Envying the men who are going to fight his battles!  I
know him."
</p>
<p>
Alf, indeed, who had clearly recovered from the first shock
of war, was very much to the fore, modest, fervent, the
unassuming patriot.  Now he approached his brother
with a mixture of wariness and manly frankness.
</p>
<p>
"Will you shake 'ands, Ernest?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"I will <i>not</i>," said Ern.  "It was you who done the dirty
on our Lal."
</p>
<p>
"Never!" cried Alf and came a step closer.  "I'll tell
you who it were."  He nodded stealthily in the direction
of Joe.  "That's the chap that's out to spoil your home.
Wrecker I call him.  I tell you what, Ern," he whispered.
"I'll watch out against him for you while you are away
so you don't suffer."
</p>
<p>
"I thank you," said Ern, unmoved.
</p>
<p>
Just then Joe came up, took him by the arm, and
bustled him off to the departure platform.
</p>
<p>
"You'll be late else, ma lad," said the engineer.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV
<br><br>
IN THE EVENING
</h3>
<p>
The Archdeacon and his sidesman walked back to Old
Town from the station together.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp and Mr. Pigott followed behind.
</p>
<p>
"The Archdeacon lags a bit," said the former.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered the other.  "And I don't wonder.
This war'll be the end of him yet.  You heard about last
night?"
</p>
<p>
The veteran had sallied out at midnight with an electric
torch and the Reverend Spink to deal with spies who had
been signalling from the top of the Downs.
</p>
<p>
Unhappily the stalker had himself been stalked by
another patriot bent on the same errand.  The two old
gentlemen had arrested each other by the dew-pond on
Warren Hill; and report had it that words and worse
had passed between the two.  In the small hours of the
morning Anne Caspar, hearing voices, had risen and seen
from her window the Archdeacon stalking down the road,
dusty, draggled, his curate trotting with sullen barks at
the heels of his chief.  The Archdeacon had no prisoner,
but he had lumbago, a scratch or two, and an indignant
sense that his curate had proved both disloyal and
inefficient.  The two had parted at the Rectory gate wrathfully,
the Reverend Spink offering his resignation.
</p>
<p>
Opposite his garage in the Golfs, Alf now said goodbye
to his Rector, and crossed the road with an almost
aggressively sprightly air.  Mr. Trupp noticed it.
</p>
<p>
"What about him and his Touring Syndicate?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"He's all right," answered Mr. Pigott.  "Trust him
for that.  Artful isn't in it with Alf.  Called his drivers
together on the declaration of war, and made em a speech.
Said he knew where they wanted to be—where he wanted
to be himself: in the fighting line.  He'd be the last to
stand between them and their duty.  He wouldn't keep
them to their contract.  The Motor Transport was crying
for them—five bob a day and glory galore.  All he could
do was to say God bless you and wish he could go
himself—only his responsibilities...."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp grinned.
</p>
<p>
"Did they swallow it down?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Like best butter," said Mr. Pigott.  "He's got the
tongue.  He twisted em.  Parliament's the place for Alf."
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" committed the other.  "We're only beginning.
This war'll find us all out too before we're through." ...
</p>
<p>
Alf turned into his yard.
</p>
<p>
A little group of broken down old men were waiting
him there.
</p>
<p>
"Who are you?" he asked fiercely.  "What you want?"
</p>
<p>
"We've come on behalf of the cleaners, sir," said the
spokesman, in the uncertain voice of the half-starved.
"What about us?—The Army don't want us."
</p>
<p>
The group tittered a feeble deprecatory titter.
</p>
<p>
"H'every man for himself in these days!" cried Alf,
brief and brisk.  "I'm not the Charity Organisation
Society."
</p>
<p>
The old man, a-quaver in voice and body, doddered
forward, touching his hat.  Undersized and shrunken
through starvation during infancy, and brutal usage
throughout his growing years, he was an example of the
great principle we Christians have enforced and maintained
throughout the centuries: that the world's hardest
work should be done by the weakest.  Tip, as he was called,
had been a coal-porter till at fifty-five he dislocated his
shoulder shifting loads too heavy for him.  Thereafter
he was partially disabled, a casualty of the Industrial
War, and to be treated as such.
</p>
<p>
"Would you give us a week's money or notice, sir?"
he said now in his shaking voice.
</p>
<p>
"Did I take you on by the week?" asked Alf
ferociously.
</p>
<p>
"No, sir; by the day."
</p>
<p>
"Then what ye talking about?—Ain't I paid you up?"
</p>
<p>
"You paid us up, sir.  Only we got to live."
</p>
<p>
"Very well then.  There's the House at the top of the
hill for such as you.  Ain't that good enough?  This is a
Christian country, this is."
</p>
<p>
Alf was half-way up the steps to his office, and he pointed
in the direction of the Work-house.
</p>
<p>
A curious tawny glow lit the old man's eyes.  His
lips closed over his gums.
</p>
<p>
"Bloody Bastille," he muttered.
</p>
<p>
Alf heard him and ran down the steps.  He was still
with the stillness of the born bully.
</p>
<p>
"None of that now," he said quietly.  "No filthy
language in my yard!  And no loiterin eether!—Off you
go or I send for the police.  The country's got something
better to think of than you and your likes, I reckon, just
now."
</p>
<p>
He stood in the gate of the yard with the cold domineering
air of the warder in charge of convicts.
</p>
<p>
The cleaners shambled away like a herd of mangy
donkeys past work and turned out on waste land to die at
their leisure.
</p>
<p>
They were broken men all, old and infirm, drawn from
the dregs of that Reserve of Labour on which the capitalist
system has been built.  They belonged to no Union;
they were incapable of organisation and therefore of defence
against the predatory class ...
</p>
<p>
"We got no bloody country, men like us ain't."
</p>
<p>
"Nor no bloody Christ."
</p>
<p>
"The rich got Him too."
</p>
<p>
"Same as they got everythink else" ...
</p>
<p>
The last of them gone, Alf skipped up the steps into his
office.  He was not afraid of them, was not even depressed
by their uncalled-for consideration of themselves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed he was extraordinarily uplifted.
</p>
<p>
His great scheme had, it is true, been brought
low—through no omission on his part; but he had got out
with a squeeze after a dreadful period of panic fury, and
now experienced the lyrical exhilaration of the man who
has escaped by his own exertions from sudden unexpected
death.
</p>
<p>
He had unloaded his drivers on the Army; and sold his
buses to the Government.  The only big creditor was
Captain Royal, and Alf could afford to laugh at him.
Besides Captain Royal would be off to the war—and might
not come back.  Moreover, unless he was much mistaken,
the war meant all manner of chances of which the man
with his eyes open would take full advantage: world
convulsions always did.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile he had the garages on which he could rebuild
his original edifice at any moment, add to it, alter it
as opportunity offered.  The war would not last for ever;
but it would un-make businesses and devour men—some
of them his rivals.  While they were away at the Front
he would be quietly, ceaselessly strengthening his position
at home.  And when peace came, as it must some day,
he would be ready to reap where he had sown in
enterprise and industry.
</p>
<p>
On his way up to Old Town that evening he met the
Reverend Spink and asked him how long the
Franco-Prussian war had lasted.
</p>
<p>
The curate still had the ruffled and resentful air of a
fighting cockerel who has a grievance against the referee.
Lady Augusta, indeed, had passed a busy morning smoothing
his plumage and inducing him to withdraw his resignation.
His meeting with Alf served as further balm to his
wounded spirit; for above all else the Reverend Spink
loved to be appealed to as a scholar.
</p>
<p>
Now he answered Alf with a learned frown,
</p>
<p>
"Six months.  It began at the same date as this.
They were in Paris by January."
</p>
<p>
"As long as that!" said Alf surprised.  "Looks as
if they'd be quicker this time!"
</p>
<p>
A thought struck him.  He turned down Borough
Lane, and went to call on Ruth.
</p>
<p>
She was at home, alone in the kitchen, her babes in
bed.  He did not enter, but stood in the door awhile
before she was aware of him, watching her with sugary
and secretive smile.
</p>
<p>
Then he chirped.
</p>
<p>
She looked up, saw him; and the light faded out of
her face.
</p>
<p>
"So Ern's gone to the wars," he said.  "You'll be
a bit lonely like o nights, the evenings drawing in and all.
Say, I might drop in on you when I got the time.  I'm
not so busy, as I was.  Likely I'll be goin back to drive
for Mr. Trupp now."
</p>
<p>
She rose, formidable as a lioness at bay in the mouth
of her cave.
</p>
<p>
"Out of it!" she ordered, and flung an imperious
hand towards the door.
</p>
<p>
Alf fled incontinently.
</p>
<p>
A navvy, who had been watching him from a door
opposite, shouldered heavily across the street to meet him.
He was a very big man with a very small head, dressed
in corduroys; of the type you still meet in the pages of
Punch but seldom in real life.  His hands were deep in
his pockets, and he said quietly without so much as
removing his pipe.
</p>
<p>
"Stow the bloody truck then!"
</p>
<p>
Alf paused, astonished.  Then he thought the other
must have mistaken his man in the dusk.
</p>
<p>
"Here! d'you know who you're talkin to?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The navvy showed himself quite undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
"Oughter," he said, "seein you and me was dragg'd oop
same school togedder along o Mr. Pigott back yarnderr.
You're Alf Caspar, and I be Reuben Deadman.  There's
an old saying these paarts you may have heard—<i>When
there isn't a Deadman in Lewes Gaol you may knaw the end
o't world's at hand</i>.  I've not been in maself, not yet.
When I goos I'll goo for to swing—for you—for old times
sake; let alone the dirty dish you done Old Tip and them
this arternoon."
</p>
<p>
Alf walked up the hill, breathing heavily and with
mottled face.
</p>
<p>
The bubble of his exaltation had burst.  He felt a
curious sinking away within him, as though he were walking
on cold damp clouds which were letting him through.
</p>
<p>
The war was changing things already, and not to his
liking.
</p>
<p>
Three weeks ago who'd have talked to the Managing
Director of Caspar's Syndicate like that?
</p>
<p>
Brooding on his troubles, he ran into Joe Burt who was
coming swiftly round the corner of Borough Lane, brooding
too.
</p>
<p>
Alf darted nimbly back.  Joe stood with lowered head,
glaring at his enemy.  Then he thought better of it and
turned on his way.
</p>
<p>
Alf, standing in the middle of the road with jeering
eyes, called after him furtively.
</p>
<p>
"Want her all to yourself, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
Joe marched on unheeding to the cottage Alf had
just left.
</p>
<p>
Ruth must have been awaiting him: for he entered
at once without knocking.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI
<br><br>
RUTH FACES THE STORM
</h3>
<p>
That night as the Colonel sat on the loggia chewing his
pipe, long after Mrs. Lewknor had retired, he was aware
of a pillar of blackness, erect against the dull sea and
star-lit sky, on the edge of the cliff, at the very spot where
he had seen it on the night of the declaration of war.
</p>
<p>
Electric torch in hand, he stole out on the pair.  Oblivious
of all things save each other, they remained locked in each
other's arms.  He flashed the torch full in their faces.
</p>
<p>
"O, Joe!" came a familiar voice.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel was taken a-back.
</p>
<p>
"That you, Anne?" he muttered.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir," his parlour-maid answered.  "Me and
my Joe.  He come up to say goodbye.  Joining up
to-morrow, he is."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel mumbled something about spies, and
apologised.
</p>
<p>
"No harm done, sir," laughed Anne, quietly.  "It's
nothing to some of them.  Turn their search-light full
glare on you just when you don't want, and never a
by-your-leave—same as they done war-night!  <i>If that's war</i>, I
says to Joe, <i>better ha done with it afore you begin</i>, I says."
</p>
<p>
The Colonel retired indoors, doubly humiliated: he
had made a fool of himself before his own parlour-maid,
and in his mind he had gravely wronged Ruth Caspar.
</p>
<p>
Next day he started off for Old Town to find out if there
was any way by which he could make amends to his own
conscience and, unknown to her, to the woman he had
maligned.
</p>
<p>
She met him with kind eyes, a little wistful.
</p>
<p>
"We're all friends now, sir," she said, as she shook
hands.  "Got to be, I reckon."
</p>
<p>
If it is true, as is said to-day, that old men make wars
and young men pay for them, it is also true that the mothers,
wives, sisters, and sweethearts of the young men bear
their share of the burthen.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was left with four children and a debt.
</p>
<p>
She faced the situation as hundreds of thousands of
women up and down Europe in like case were doing at that
moment—quiet, courageous, uncomplaining as an animal
under the blows that Life, the inexplicable, rained upon her.
One thought constantly recurred to her.  In her first
tragedy she had stood alone against the world.  Now there
were millions undergoing the same experience.  And she
derived from that thought comfort denied to others.
</p>
<p>
There were no complications about her economic
situation.
</p>
<p>
That at least was very simple.
</p>
<p>
She owed several weeks' rent, had debts outstanding
to the tune of several shillings—mostly boots for the
children; and a little cash in coppers in hand.
</p>
<p>
Two nights after Ernie's departure, Alf came round
for his back-rent.  He came stealthily, Ruth noticed;
and she knew why.  Public opinion in the Moot, which
might at any moment find explosive self-expression through
the fists of Reuben Deadman, was against him.  It was
against all landlords.  Ern moreover was still a hero in
the eyes of the Moot and would remain so for several days
yet; and Ruth received the consideration due to the wife
of such.
</p>
<p>
Alf was dogged, with downcast eyes.  There was no
nonsense, no persiflage about him.  He went straight to
the point.
</p>
<p>
"I come for my money," he said.
</p>
<p>
Ruth rallied him maliciously.
</p>
<p>
"Money!" she cried, feigning surprise.  "I thart it
was accommodation you was a'ter."
</p>
<p>
"And I mean to have it," Alf continued sullenly.
</p>
<p>
"Even a landlord's got to live these times.  I got to have
it or you got to go.  That's straight."
</p>
<p>
Ruth had her back to the wall.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you must have that out with the Government,"
she said coolly.  "It's got nothing to do with me."
</p>
<p>
"Government!" cried Alf sharply.  "What's the
Government got to do with it."
</p>
<p>
"They're passin some law to protect the women and
children of them that's joined up," Ruth answered.
</p>
<p>
"Who said so?"
</p>
<p>
"The Colonel."
</p>
<p>
"Anyway it's not passed yet."
</p>
<p>
"No," retorted Ruth.  "So you'd best wait till it is.
Make you look a bit funny like to turn me out, and put
some one else in, and then have to turn them out and put
me back again, say in a fortnight, and all out o your own
pocket.  Not to talk o the bit of feeling, and them and
me taking damages off o you as like as not, I should say."
</p>
<p>
That evening Ruth went up to see Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
The Manager said he would pay her half Ern's wages while
the war lasted; and he paid her the first instalment then
and there.
</p>
<p>
"Will the Government do anything for the women and
children sir?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pigott shook his grizzled head.
</p>
<p>
As the years went by he had an always diminishing
faith in the power and will of Governments to right wrongs.
</p>
<p>
"The old chapel's the thing," he would say.
</p>
<p>
Ruth put the same question to Mr. Trupp whom she
met on her way home to the Moot.
</p>
<p>
"They will if they're made to," the doctor answered,
and as he saw the young woman's face fall, he added more
sympathetically, "They're trying to do something locally.
I don't know what'll come of it.  Keep in touch with
Mrs. Trupp.  She'll let you know.  I believe there's to be
a meeting at the Town Hall."
</p>
<p>
He rolled on, grumbling and grousing to himself.  Call
ourselves a civilised country, and leave the women and
children to take their luck!  Chaos—as usual! ... Chaos
backed and justified by cant! ... Would
cant organise Society? ... Would cant feed the
women and children? ... Would cant take the
place of Scientific Method? ...
</p>
<p>
Ruth went home with her eleven shillings and sixpence
and an aching heart, to find that little Alice had already
arranged her brood in their bibs around the tea-table, and
was only waiting for mother to come and tilt the kettle
which she might not touch.
</p>
<p>
The other fledgelings hammered noisily on the table
with their spoons.
</p>
<p>
"My dears," she said, as she went round the table,
kissing the rosy faces uplifted to hers.
</p>
<p>
"What is it, Mum?" asked little Alice, who had
something of her mother's quick sympathy and power of
intuition.  "Is daddy shotted at the war?"
</p>
<p>
"Not yet, my pretty," her mother answered.  "It's only
nothing you can understand.  Now help me get the tea."
</p>
<p>
Next day brought a lawyer's letter giving her notice
to quit.
</p>
<p>
That evening Ruth took the letter up to the Manor-house.
</p>
<p>
The maid told her Mr. and Mrs. Trupp had just started
off to a meeting at the Town Hall.
</p>
<p>
"Something to do with the women and children, I
believe," she added.  "Prince o Wales's Fund or something."
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned down the steps disconsolate.
</p>
<p>
Just then she saw Joe Burt getting off the motor-bus
opposite the <i>Star</i>.  She had not seen him since he had come
up on the evening of Ern's departure to give her the latest
news of her husband.  Now he came striding towards her,
blowing into her life with the vigour of Kingsley's wild
Nor'-easter.  At the moment the politician was on
top—she noted it with thankful heart.
</p>
<p>
"Coom on, ma lass!" he said.  "You're the very
one I'm after.  We want you.  We want em all.  You
got to coom along o me to this meeting."
</p>
<p>
"But I aren't got my hat, Joe!" pleaded Ruth,
amused yet deprecating.
</p>
<p>
The engineer would take no excuses.
</p>
<p>
"Your children are worth more'n your hat, I reck'n,"
he said.  "Coom on!—Coom on!—No time to be lost!"
</p>
<p>
And in a moment she was walking briskly at his side
down the hill up which he had just come.
</p>
<p>
The strength, the resolution, the certainty of her
companion swept all her clouds away and renewed her faith.
</p>
<p>
She told him of the notice she had received.
</p>
<p>
"All the better," he said.  "Another trump for us to
play.  Don't you worrit.  The Labour Party in Parliament's
disappointed all its supporters so far, but it's going
to justify itself at last.  One thing.  They can't trample
on us this time, the Fats canna.  We're too well organised."
</p>
<p>
They walked down the hill together.
</p>
<p>
At the stile opposite the Drill Hall where six months
before she had rescued Ernie, drenched and dripping, from
the police, they turned off into Saffrons Croft in the direction
of the Town Hall.
</p>
<p>
Joe, as he trod the grass beneath his feet, became
sombre, silent.  The woman sweeping along at his side,
her shawl about her head, felt his change of mood.  The
Other was coming to the top again—the One she feared.
She was right.  The Other it was who spoke surlily
and growling, out of his deeps, like the voice of a
yard-dog from his kennel.
</p>
<p>
"Well, what's it going to be?"
</p>
<p>
Her heart galloped but she met him gaily.
</p>
<p>
"What you mean, Joe?"
</p>
<p>
"You know what I mean," bearing down on her
remorselessly.
</p>
<p>
She made a half halt.
</p>
<p>
"O Joe!"
</p>
<p>
"Aye, you may O Joe me!  That wunna better it."
</p>
<p>
"And after what you promised him solemn that night
and all."
</p>
<p>
He answered moodily.
</p>
<p>
"He forced me to it.  Took advantage.  Shouldn't
ha done it.  Springin it on me without a word.  That's
not the game."
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned on him.
</p>
<p>
"You're the one to talk, aren't you?" she said,
flashing the corner of an eye at him.  "Playing the game
prarper, you are?"
</p>
<p>
He barged ahead, sullen as a bull and as obstinate.
</p>
<p>
"A don't know; and A don't care.  A know what A
want and A know A'm going to get it."
</p>
<p>
She met him light as a rapier thrust.
</p>
<p>
"I thart you was a man, Joe."
</p>
<p>
"Better'n a no-man anyway."
</p>
<p>
She stopped dead and faced him.
</p>
<p>
"Where's my no-man now then?" she cried.  "And
where are you?"
</p>
<p>
That time she had planted her dart home.  He glared
at her savage, sullen, and with lowered head.
</p>
<p>
"Thou doesna say A'm a coward?"
</p>
<p>
Slowly she answered,
</p>
<p>
"I'm none so sure.—Ern's my soldier, Ern is."
</p>
<p>
He gripped her arm.
</p>
<p>
"I'll go home," she said, curt as the cut of a whip.
</p>
<p>
He relaxed.
</p>
<p>
"Nay," he answered.  "If we're to fight for your
children yo mun help."
</p>
<p>
She threw off his arm with a gesture of easy dignity.
Then they walked on again together down Saffrons Road
towards the Town Hall.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII
<br><br>
MRS. LEWKNOR
</h3>
<p>
The Town Hall was crowded.
</p>
<p>
The Mayor, who was in the chair, had spoken on behalf
of the Prince of Wales's Fund and announced that
subscriptions would be received by the Town Clerk.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter an indescribable orgie of patriotism had
taken place.  Red-necked men outbid fat women.  The
bids mounted; the bidders grew fiercer; the cheers waxed.
And all the while a little group of Trade Unionists at the
back of the hall kept up a dismal chaunt—
</p>
<p class="poem">
  We don't want charity,<br>
  We won't have charity.<br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Then a little dapper figure in the blue of a chauffeur
rose in the body of the hall.
</p>
<p>
"I'm only a workin chauffeur," he said, wagging his
big head, "but I got a conscience, and I got a country.
And I'm not ashamed of em eether.  I can't do much
bein only a worker as you might say.  But I can do me
bit.  Put me down for fifty guineas, please, Mr. Town-clerk."
</p>
<p>
He sat down modestly amidst loud applause.
</p>
<p>
"Who's that?" whispered the Colonel on the platform.
</p>
<p>
"Trupp's chauffeur," the Archdeacon, who had a
black patch over his eye, answered with a swagger—"my
sidesman, Alfred Caspar.  Not so bad for a
working-man?"  He cackled hilariously.
</p>
<p>
Then a voice from Lancashire, resonant and jarring,
came burring across the hall.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Chairman, are you aware that Alfred Caspar
is turning his sister-in-law out of his house with four
children."
</p>
<p>
Alf leapt to his feet.
</p>
<p>
"It's a lie!" he cried.
</p>
<p>
A big young woman sitting just in front of Joe rose
on subdued wings.  She was bare-headed, be-shawled,
a dark Madonna of English village-life.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, you are, Alf," she said, and sat down quietly
as she had risen.
</p>
<p>
There was a dramatic silence.  Then the Archdeacon
started to his feet and pointed with accusing claw like a
witch-doctor smelling out a victim.
</p>
<p>
"I know that woman!" he cawed raucously.
</p>
<p>
A lady sitting in the front row just under the platform
rose.
</p>
<p>
"So do I," she said.
</p>
<p>
It was Mrs. Trupp, and her voice, still and pure, fell
on the heated air like a drop of delicious rain.
</p>
<p>
She sat down again.
</p>
<p>
The Archdeacon too had resumed his seat, very high and
mighty; and Bobby Chislehurst was whispering in his
ear from behind.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel had risen now, calm and courteous as always,
in the suppressed excitement.
</p>
<p>
"Am I not right in thinking that Mrs. Caspar is the
wife of an old Hammer-man who joined up at once on the
declaration of war and is at this moment somewhere in
France fighting our battles for us?"
</p>
<p>
The question was greeted with a storm of applause from
the back of the hall.
</p>
<p>
"Good old Colonel!" some one called.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Chairman, d'you mean to accept that man's
cheque?" shouted Joe.  "Yes or no?"
</p>
<p>
In the uproar that followed, Alf rose again, white and
leering.
</p>
<p>
"I'd not have spoken if I'd known I was to be set upon
like this afore em all for offering a bit of help to me
country.  As to my character and that, I believe I'm pretty
well beknown for a patriot in Beachbourne."
</p>
<p>
"As to patriotism, old cock," called Joe, "didn't you
sack your cleaners without notice on the declaration of
war?"
</p>
<p>
"No, I didn't then!" shouted Alf with the exaggerated
ferocity of the man who knows his only chance is to pose
as righteously indignant.
</p>
<p>
The retort was greeted with a howl of <i>Tip</i>!  There
was a movement at the back of the hall; and suddenly
an old man was lifted on the shoulders of the Trade
Unionists there.  Yellow, fang-less, creased, he looked,
poised on high above the crowd against the white
background of wall, something between a mummy and a monkey.
As always he wore no tie; but he had donned a collar for
the occasion, and this had sprung open and made two
dingy ass-like ears on either side of his head.
</p>
<p>
"Did he sack you, Tip?" called Joe.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, he did," came the quivering old voice.  "Turned
us off at a day.  Told us to go to the Bastille; and said
he'd put the police on us."
</p>
<p>
The tremulous old voice made people turn their heads.
They saw the strange figure lifted above them.  Some
tittered.  The ripple of titters enraged the men at the
back of the hall.
</p>
<p>
"See what you've made of him!" thundered Joe.
"And then jeer! ... Shame!"
</p>
<p>
"Shame!" screamed a bitter man.  "Do the Fats
know shame?"
</p>
<p>
"Some of em do," said a quiet voice.
</p>
<p>
It was true too.  Mrs. Trupp was looking pale and
miserable in the front-row, so was the Colonel on the
platform, Bobby Chislehurst and others.  The titterers,
indeed, howled into silence by the storm of indignation
their action had aroused, wore themselves the accusing
air of those who hope thereby to fix the blame for their
mistake on others.
</p>
<p>
In the silence a baggy old gentleman rose in the body
of the hall, slewed round with difficulty, and mooned
above his spectacles at the strange idol seated on men's
shoulders behind him.
</p>
<p>
"<i>And He was lifted up</i>," he said in a musing voice
more to himself than to anybody else.
</p>
<p>
The phrase, audible to many, seemed to spread a silence
about it as a stone dropped in a calm pond creates an
ever-broadening ripple.
</p>
<p>
In the silence old Tip slid gently to the ground and was
lost once more amid the crowd of those who had raised him
for a brief moment into fleeting eminence.
</p>
<p>
The meeting broke up.
</p>
<p>
Outside the hall stood Mr. Trupp's car, Alf at the
wheel: for the old surgeon's regular chauffeur had been
called up.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp, coming down the steps, went up to Ruth
who was standing on the pavement.
</p>
<p>
"So glad you spoke up, Ruth," she said, and pressed
her hand.
</p>
<p>
"Come on!" said Mr. Trupp.  "We'll give you a
lift home, Ruth."
</p>
<p>
Alf was looking green.  The two women got in, and the
old surgeon followed them.  He was grinning, Mrs. Trupp
quietly malicious, and Ruth amused.  The people on the
pavement and streaming out of the hall saw and were
caught by the humour of the situation, as their eyes and
comments showed.
</p>
<p>
Then Colonel Lewknor made his way to the car.
</p>
<p>
"Just a word, Mrs. Caspar!" he said.  "Things are
squaring up.  Mrs. Lewknor's taking the women and
children in hand.  Could you come and see her one morning
at Under-cliff?"
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The hostel that Mrs. Lewknor had built upon the cliff
boomed from the start.  It was full to over-flowing, winter
and summer; and Eton was in sight for Toby when war
was declared.
</p>
<p>
Then things changed apace.
</p>
<p>
Beachbourne, for at least a thousand years before
William the Norman landed at Pevensey on his great
adventure, had been looked on as the likeliest spot for
enemy invasion from the Continent.  Frenzied parents
therefore wired for their children to be sent inland at
once; others wrote charming letters cancelling rooms
taken weeks before.  In ten days the house was empty;
and on the eleventh the mortgagee intimated his intention
to fore-close.
</p>
<p>
It was a staggering blow.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, with that uncannie cat-like intuition of
his she knew so well, prowled in, looked at her with kind
eyes, as she sat in her little room the fatal letter in her
hand, and went out again.
</p>
<p>
Throughout it had been her scheme, not his, her
responsibility, her success; and now it was her failure.
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Trupp was shown in, looking most unmilitary
in his uniform of a Colonel of the Royal Army Medical
Corps.
</p>
<p>
"It's all right," he said gruffly.  "I know.  Morgan
and Evans rang me up and told me.  Unprofessional
perhaps, but these are funny times.  I let you in.  You
built the hostel at my request.  I shall take over the
mortgage."
</p>
<p>
"I couldn't let you," answered the little lady.
</p>
<p>
"You won't be asked," replied the other.  "I ought
to have done it from the start; but it wasn't very
convenient then.  It's all right now."  The old man didn't
say that the reason it was all right was because he was
quietly convinced in his own mind that his boy Joe would
need no provision now.
</p>
<p>
Just then the Colonel entered, looking self-conscious.
He seemed to know all about it, as indeed he had every
right to do, seeing that Mr. Trupp had informed him at
length on the telephone half an hour before.
</p>
<p>
"You know who the mortgagee is?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Who?" said both at once.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel on tiptoe led them out into the hall, and
showed them through a narrow window Alf sitting at his
wheel, looking very funny.
</p>
<p>
"Our friend of the scene in the Town Hall yesterday," he
whispered.  "When I went to the bank yesterday to insure
the house against bombardment, the clerk looked surprised
and said—<i>You know it's already insured</i>.  I said—<i>Who
by</i>?  He turned up a ledger and showed me the name."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Trupp got into his car, wrapping himself round
with much circumstance.
</p>
<p>
"To Morgan and Evans," he said to Alf.
</p>
<p>
In the solicitors' office he produced his cheque-book.
</p>
<p>
"I've been seeing Mrs. Lewknor," he said.  "I'll
pay off your client now and take over the mortgage myself."
</p>
<p>
He wrote a cheque then and there, and made it out to
Alfred Caspar, who was forthwith called in.
</p>
<p>
"I'm paying you off your mortgage, Alf," he said.
"Give me a receipt, will you?"
</p>
<p>
Alf with the curious simplicity that often threw his
cunning into relief signed the receipt quite unabashed
and with evident relief.
</p>
<p>
"See, I need the money, sir," he said gravely, as he
wiped the pen on his sleeve.  "The Syndicate's let me
in—O, you wouldn't believe!  And I got to meet me creditors
somehow."
</p>
<p>
"Well, you've got the money now," answered Mr. Trupp.
"But I'm afraid you've made an enemy.  And
that seems to me a bit of a pity just now."
</p>
<p>
"Colonel Lewknor?" snorted Alf.  "I ain't afraid
o him!"
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," said Mr. Trupp.  "It's the day of
the soldier."
</p>
<p>
That evening, after the day's work, Alf was summoned
to his employer's study.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trupp was leaving it as he entered.
</p>
<p>
"I've been thinking things over, Alfred," said the old
man.  "There's no particular reason why you shouldn't
drive for me for the present if you like—until you're wanted
out there.  But I shall want you to destroy this."
</p>
<p>
He handed his chauffeur Ruth's notice to quit.
</p>
<p>
Alf tore the paper up without demur.
</p>
<p>
"That's all right, sir," he said cheerfully.  "That was
a mistake.  I understood the Army Service Corps was
taking over my garage; and I should want a roof over
my head to sleep under."
</p>
<p>
He went back to his car.
</p>
<p>
Another moment, and the door of the Manor-house
opened.  Ruth emerged briskly and gave him a bright
nod.
</p>
<p>
"Can't stop now, Alf," she said.  "I'm off to see
Mrs. Lewknor.  See you again later."
</p>
<p>
"That's right," Alf answered.  "She's on the committee
for seeing to the married women ain't she?—them and
their <i>lawful</i> children.  Reverend Spink's on it too."
</p>
<p>
He stressed the epithet faintly.
</p>
<p>
A moment Ruth looked him austerely in the eyes.
Then she turned up the hill with a nod.  She understood.
There was danger a-foot again.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The matter of the hostel settled, Mrs. Lewknor, before
everything an Imperialist, and not of the too common
platform kind, was free to serve.  And she had not far to
look for an opening.
</p>
<p>
The Mayor summoned a meeting in his parlour to
consider the situation of the families of soldiers called to
the colours.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor was by common consent appointed
honorary secretary of the Association formed; and was
given by her committee a fairly free discretion to meet
the immediate situation.
</p>
<p>
Nearly sixty, but still active as a cat, she set to work
with a will.
</p>
<p>
Her sitting room at Undercliff she turned into an office.
Her mornings she gave to interviewing applicants and her
afternoons to visiting.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Caspar was one of the first to apply.
</p>
<p>
The little slight Jewish lady with her immense experience
of life greeted the beautiful peasant woman who had
never yet over-stepped the boundaries of Sussex with a
brilliant smile.
</p>
<p>
"There's not much I want to know about you," she
said.  "We belong to the same regiment.  Just one or
two questions that I may fill up this form."
</p>
<p>
How many children had Mrs. Caspar.
</p>
<p>
"Three, 'M ... and a fourth."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor waited.
</p>
<p>
"Little Alice," continued Ruth, downcast and pale
beneath her swarthiness.  "Before I were married."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor wrote on apparently unconcerned.
</p>
<p>
She knew all about little Alice, had seen her once, and
had recognised her at a glance as Royal's child, the child
for which, with her passionate love for the regiment, she
felt herself in part responsible.  On the same occasion she
had seen Ruth's other babies and their grandfather with
them—that troubadour who forty years before had
swept the harp of her life to sudden and elusive music.
</p>
<p>
"I think that'll be all right now, Ruth," she said
with a re-assuring look.  "I'm going to call you that now
if I may.  I'll come round and let you know directly I
know myself."
</p>
<p>
Ruth retired with haunted eyes.  She guessed rather
than knew the forces that were gathering against her,
and the strength of them.
</p>
<p>
Outside in the porch she met Lady Augusta with her
mane of thick bobbed white hair and rosy face; and on
the cliff, as she walked home, other ladies of the Committee
and the Reverend Spink.
</p>
<p>
How hard they looked and how complacent! ...
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor put the case before her committee, telling
them just as much as she thought it good for them to
know.
</p>
<p>
There was of course the inevitable trouble about little
Alice.
</p>
<p>
"We don't even know for certain that she is the child
of the man the mother afterwards married," objected
Lady Augusta Willcocks in her worst manner.  "She
mayn't be a soldier's child at all."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor turned in her lips.
</p>
<p>
"Our business surely is to support the women and
children while the men are away fighting our battles,"
she said.
</p>
<p>
"Need we form ourselves into a private enquiry office?"
asked Mrs. Trupp quietly.
</p>
<p>
The old lady's eyes flashed.  Mrs. Trupp of course
didn't care.  Mrs. Trupp never went to church.  "Putting
a premium on immorality!" she cried with bitter
laughter—"as usual."
</p>
<p>
"We must look a little into character surely,
Mrs. Lewknor," said a honied virgin from St. Michael's.
</p>
<p>
"I'll go bail for this woman's character," answered
Mrs. Lewknor, flashing in her turn.
</p>
<p>
"I believe she <i>is</i> more respectable than she used to be,"
said a dull spinster with a dogged eye.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Damn</i> respectability," thought Mrs. Lewknor, but
she said, "Are we to deprive this child of bread in the name
of respectability?  Whatever else she is she's a child of the
Empire."
</p>
<p>
Then the Reverend Spink spoke.  He and Lady Augusta
Willcocks were there to represent the point of view of the
Church.
</p>
<p>
He spoke quietly, his eyes down, and lips compressed,
mock-meekly aware of the dramatic significance of his
words.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps I ought to tell the committee that the man
this woman is now living with is not her husband."
</p>
<p>
The silence that greeted this announcement was all that
the reverend gentleman could have desired.  It was only
broken by the loud triumphant cry of the Lady Augusta
Willcocks.
</p>
<p>
"Then all <i>four</i> children are illegitimate!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that <i>would</i> be joyful!" cried Mrs. Lewknor
with a little titter.
</p>
<p>
It was the great moment of the Reverend Spink's life.
</p>
<p>
"She married some yeahs ago," he continued, so
well-pleased with the cumulative effect of the impression he
was making, as even to venture an imitation of the
Archdeacon's accent.  "And her husband is still alive."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor challenged swiftly.
</p>
<p>
"Where did she marry?" she asked, lest another
question should be asked first: for the honour of the
regiment was involved.
</p>
<p>
"At the Registrar's Office, Lewes."
</p>
<p>
"When?"
</p>
<p>
"September 14th, 1906."
</p>
<p>
The man had his story pat enough to be sure.
</p>
<p>
"Who told you?" asked Mrs. Lewknor aggressively.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spink pursed his lips.
</p>
<p>
"I have it on reliable information."
</p>
<p>
"I know your authority, I think," said Mrs. Trupp
quietly.
</p>
<p>
"Did you check it?" asked Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
"It was unnecessary," replied the curate insolently.
"I can trust my authority.  But if you doubt me you can
check it yourself."
</p>
<p>
"I shall of course," retorted the little lady.
</p>
<p>
Then the Chairman interposed.
</p>
<p>
"It looks like a case for the police," he said.
</p>
<p>
"Certainly," Lady Augusta rapped out.
</p>
<p>
"It's very serious," said the Chairman.
</p>
<p>
"For somebody," retorted Mrs. Lewknor.
</p>
<p>
By common consent the case was adjourned.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Spink retired to Old Town.
</p>
<p>
The fierce hostility of Mrs. Lewknor, and the no less
formidable resistance of Mrs. Trupp, made the curate
uneasy.
</p>
<p>
After dark he went round to Alf Caspar's garage.
</p>
<p>
"You're sure of your facts?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"Dead cert," said Alf.  "Drove em there meself."
</p>
<p>
"And the date?"
</p>
<p>
"Marked it down at the time, sir....  I can show
it you in me ledger.  Always make a note of me engagements.
You never know when it mayn't come in handy."
</p>
<p>
He went down to his office, followed by the curate,
and was proceeding to take a bulky folio down from the
shelf, when the telephone bell rang.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Trupp to say the car would be wanted at
four to-morrow afternoon.
</p>
<p>
"Is it a long run, sir?" asked Alf.
</p>
<p>
"No," came the answer.  "Lewes—Mrs. Trupp."
</p>
<p>
Alf determined to send a man and not drive himself.

CHAPTER XXXVIII
<br><br>
SUSPENSE
</h3>
<p>
Ruth walked home across the golf links, at her heart the
agony of the beaten vixen who, crawling across a ploughed
field still far from her earth, glances round to see a white
wave of hounds breaking over the fence at her brush.
</p>
<p>
At Billing's Corner she nearly ran into her mother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
For the first time Anne paused deliberately to address
her.
</p>
<p>
"That you, Mrs. Caspar?" she said, and looked
away a sour smirk on her face.  At the moment, beautiful
old woman though she was, with her porcelain complexion
of a girl, her snow-white hair, and broad-splashed dark
brows, there was a suggestion of Alf about her—Ruth
noticed it at once and was afraid.
</p>
<p>
"They're puttin away all the chance children the
mothers can't support in there," the elder woman said
casually, nodding at the blue roofs of the old cavalry
barracks at the back of Rectory Walk that was now the
Work-house.  "To save expense, I suppose—the war
or something.  If you didn't want yours to go I might
take my son's children off your hands.  Then you could
go out and char for her."
</p>
<p>
Ruth sickened.
</p>
<p>
"No, thank-you, Mrs. Caspar," she said.
</p>
<p>
Just then a nurse came by pushing a wicker spinal chair
in which were a host of red-cloaked babies packed tight
as fledgelings in a nest.  Behind them trooped, two by two
and with clattering heels, a score of elder children from
the Work-house, all in the same straw hats, the same
little capes.  Ruth glanced at them as she had often done
before.  Those children, she remarked with ironic
bitterness, were well-soaped, wonderfully so, well-groomed,
well-fed, with short hogged hair, and stout boots; but
she noted about them all, in spite of their apparent material
prosperity, the air of spiritual discontent which is the
hallmark, all the world over, of children who know nothing
of a mother's jealous and discriminating care.
</p>
<p>
"The not-wanteds," said Anne.  "They'll put yours
along with them, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
Ruth shook.  Then she lifted up her eyes and saw help
coming.  Old Mr. Caspar was bundling down the road
towards her, crowding on all sail and waving his umbrella
as though to tell her that he had seen her mute S.O.S.
</p>
<p>
Anne drew away.
</p>
<p>
"There's my husband," she said.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," answered Ruth, "that's dad," and walked
away down Church Street, trembling still but faintly
relieved that she had planted her pin in the heart of her
enemy before disengaging.
</p>
<p>
She reached home and turned the key behind her.
That vague enemy, named <i>They</i>, who haunts each one of
us through life, was hard on her heels.  She was in her
earth at last; but <i>They</i> could dig her out.  Before now
she had seen them do it on Windhover, with halloos, the
men and women standing round with long-lashed cruel
whips to prevent escape.  She had seen them throw the
wriggling vixen to the pack ... and the worry ... and
the huntsman standing amid a foam of leaping hounds,
screaming horribly and brandishing above his head a bloody
rag that a few minutes since had been a warm and breathing
creature.  Horrible—but true ... That was the
world.  She knew it of old; and could almost have thanked
that hard old woman with eyes the blue of steel who had
just reminded her of what <i>They</i> and life were compact.
</p>
<p>
Then she noted there was silence in the house.
</p>
<p>
What if in her absence <i>They</i> had kidnapped her child—little
Alice, born in agony of flesh and spirit, so different
from those other babies, the heirs of ease and security;
little Alice, the child for whom she had fought and suffered
and endured alone.  It was her They were after: Ruth
never doubted that.  She had seen it in Lady Augusta's
eyes, as she passed her in the porch of the hostel; in the
downward glances of those other members of the committee
she had met upon the cliff; in the voice and bearing of her
mother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
She rushed upstairs.
</p>
<p>
Alice, busiest of little mothers, had tucked the other
three away in bed a little before their time because she
wanted to do it all alone and without her mother's help.
Now she was turning down her own bed.  Her aim successfully
achieved she was free to bestow on her mother a happy
smile.
</p>
<p>
Ruth swept her up in her arms, and bore her away into
her own room, devouring her with passionate eyes.
</p>
<p>
"You shall sleep along o me place o daddy," she said,
and kissed her hungrily.
</p>
<p>
"What about Susie and Jenny, mum?" asked the child.
</p>
<p>
"We'll leave the door open so we can hear," answered
Ruth, remarking even then the child's thoughtfulness.
"See, daddy wants you to take care o mother."
</p>
<p>
Alice gave a quick nod of understanding.
</p>
<p>
Next morning Ruth refused to let her go to school with
the others, would not let her leave the house.
</p>
<p>
"You'll stay along with me," she said, fierce for once.
</p>
<p>
At eleven o'clock there came a knock.  Ruth hustled
the child out into the backyard, shoved her into the
coal-shed, turned the key on her, and locked the backdoor.
Then she went very quietly not to the front-door but to the
window, opening it a crack with the utmost stealth.
Kneeling she listened.  Whoever was at the door was very
quiet, not a man.  If it had been he would have spat by
now, or sworn.
</p>
<p>
"Who is it?  she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. Lewknor," came the reply.
</p>
<p>
Ruth opened.  The little lady entered, and followed
into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
"Is it all right, 'M?" asked Ruth anxiously.
</p>
<p>
"It's going to be," replied the other, firm and confident.
"You've got your marriage-certificate if we should want
it?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth sighed her relief.
</p>
<p>
"O yes, 'M.  I got my lines all right.  They're in the
tin box under the bed."  She was running upstairs to fetch
them when the other stayed her.
</p>
<p>
"There's just one thing," said Mrs. Lewknor gravely.
"It would help Mrs. Trupp and me very much, if you could
give us some sort of idea where you were on September
14th, 1906—if you can throw your mind back all that great
way."
</p>
<p>
"I was with <i>him</i>!" Ruth answered in a flash.  She
was fighting for her best-beloved: everything must be
sacrificed to save her—even Royal.  "It was <i>the day</i>!" she
panted.  "It were the first time ever I was in a car—that's
one why I remember: Alf drove us."
</p>
<p>
"D'you happen to remember at all where you went?"
tentatively.
</p>
<p>
"All wheres," Ruth answered.  "Hailsham—Heathfield.
I hardly rithely knaws the names.  We'd tea at
Lewes—I remembers that."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor raised her keen eyes.
</p>
<p>
"You don't remember where you had tea?"
</p>
<p>
Ruth shook her head, slowly.
</p>
<p>
"I can't justly remember where.  See Lewes is such
a tarrabul great city these days—nigh as big as Beachbourne,
I reck'n.  It was over the Registrar's for births
and deaths and such like—I remember that along o the plate
at the door."
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor rose, her fine eyes sparkling.
</p>
<p>
"That's splendid, Ruth!" she said.  "All I wanted."
</p>
<p>
All that afternoon Ruth waited behind locked doors—she
did not know what for; she only knew that <i>They</i> were
prowling about watching their chance.  She had drawn
the curtains across the windows though the sun was still
high in the heaven, and sat in the darkness, longing for
Ernie as she never would have believed she could have
longed for him.  Every now and then little Alice came in
a tip-toe from the backyard to visit her.  The child thought
her mother had one of her rare head-aches, and was
solicitous accordingly.
</p>
<p>
About three o'clock Ruth crept upstairs and peeped
through her window.  It was as she had thought.  Alf
was there, strolling up and down the pavement opposite,
watching the house.  Then he saw her, half-hidden though
she was, crossed the street briskly and knocked.
</p>
<p>
She went down at once to give him battle.
</p>
<p>
He met her with his sly smile, insolently sure of himself.
</p>
<p>
"Police come yet?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
She banged the door in his face; and the bang brought
her strange relief.  With mocking knuckles he rapped on
the window on to the street as he withdrew.
</p>
<p>
After that nobody came but the children back from
school.  Ruth packed them off to bed early.  She wanted
to be alone with little Alice.
</p>
<p>
In the kitchen she waited on in the dark.
</p>
<p>
Then she heard solid familiar feet tramping down the
pavement towards her cottage.  She knew whose feet they
were, and knew their errand.  The hour of decision had
come.  One way or the other it must be.
</p>
<p>
In the confusion and uncertainty only one thing was
clear to her.  There was a way—and a price to be paid;
if she took it.
</p>
<p>
Joe knocked.
</p>
<p>
Ruth slipped to her knees.  She did not pray consciously.
Kneeling on the stone-slabs, her face uplifted in the darkness,
her hands pale on the Windsor chair before her, she opened
wide the portals of her heart to the voice of the Spirit, if
such voice there were.
</p>
<p>
And there was.  It came to her from above in the silence
and the dusk.  Ruth knew it so well, that still small voice
with the gurgle in it.
</p>
<p>
It was Susie laughing in her sleep.
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap39"></a></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX
<br><br>
THE VALLEY OF DECISION
</h3>
<p>
The answer she had sought had been given her.  Comforted
and strengthened she rose, went to the door and
unlocked it.  Joe had strolled a yard or two down the street.
She did not call him, but retired to await him in the kitchen,
leaving the door a-jar.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes his feet approached slowly.  She
heard him brush his boots in the passage, and turn the key
of the outer door behind him.  Then he entered.
</p>
<p>
An immense change had been wrought in him since
last they had met.  The bull-moose of Saffrons Croft had
given place to a man, humbled, solemn, quiet, the heir of
ages of self-discipline and the amassed spiritual treasure
of a world-old civilisation.
</p>
<p>
He stood afar off, with downward eyes.  Then he held
out both arms to her.
</p>
<p>
"Ruth, A've come to claim thee—or say good-bye."
</p>
<p>
She gripped the mantelpiece but did not answer.  Her
head was down, her eyes closed.
</p>
<p>
"Then it's goodbye, Joe," she said in a voice so small
that she hardly recognised it herself.
</p>
<p>
He dropped his hands, darkening.
</p>
<p>
"And who'll keep thee and children now Ern's gone?"
</p>
<p>
A note of harshness had crept into his voice.
</p>
<p>
She murmured something about the Government.
</p>
<p>
He laughed at her hardly.
</p>
<p>
"The Government!  What's Government ever done
for the workers?  <i>They</i> make wars: the workers pay for
em.  That law's old as the capitalist system.  What did
Government do for women and children time o South
Africa?—Left em to the mercy o God and the ruling class.
If your children are to trust for bread to the Government,
heaven help em!"
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew that it was true.  She remembered South
Africa.  In those days there had been a neighbour of theirs
at Aldwoldston, the wife of a ploughman, a woman with
six children, whose husband had been called up.  Ruth
had only been a girl then; but she remembered that
woman, and that woman's children, and her home, and
that woman's face.
</p>
<p>
"There's the ladies," she said feebly.
</p>
<p>
Joe jeered.
</p>
<p>
"You know the ladies.  So do I.  Might as lief look
for help to the Church straight off."
</p>
<p>
"There's One Above."
</p>
<p>
"Aye, there's One Above.  And He stays there too
and don't fash Himself over them below—not over you
and me and our class any road."
</p>
<p>
His tone that had been mocking became suddenly
serious.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, there's nobbut one thing now atween you and
them and Work-house."
</p>
<p>
She peeped, faintly inquisitive.
</p>
<p>
"What's that?"
</p>
<p>
"The arm of a Lancasheer lad."
</p>
<p>
There came into her eyes the tenderness tinged with
irony of the woman amused at the eternal egoism of the
male.  He noted the change in her, thought she had
relaxed, and came in upon her, instantly, appealing now—
</p>
<p>
"Coom and live with me, brother and sister, the lot
of you ... A swear to thee a wunna touch thee."
</p>
<p>
She laughed at him, low and tender.
</p>
<p>
"Never do, Joe—never!" shaking her head and
swallowing.
</p>
<p>
"Why not then?"
</p>
<p>
"There's far over much nature in us—two valiant
great chaps like you and me be."
</p>
<p>
Then little Alice entered and went to Joe, who put
a sheltering arm about her.
</p>
<p>
"Her and me and you!" he said huskily to Ruth.
"Us three against the world!  Laugh at em then!"
</p>
<p>
Ruth motioned to the child to go on up to bed.  She
went; and the two striving creatures were left alone once
more.
</p>
<p>
"Ern bequeathed thee to me."
</p>
<p>
"Aye, but he didn't rithely knaw you, and he didn't
rithely knaw me eether."
</p>
<p>
He caught at the straw.
</p>
<p>
"Then you do loov me?"
</p>
<p>
She shook her head, and the tears from her long lashes
starred her cheek.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, Joe: Ern's my man—always was and always
will be."
</p>
<p>
He stood before her, firm on his feet, and solid as a rock,
his fists clenched, his eyes on her, brilliant, dark, and
kindly.  She felt the thrill of him, his solidity, his sincerity,
above all his strength, and thrilled to him again.
</p>
<p>
"A'm the mon for thee," he said.
</p>
<p>
She did not answer.  In her ears was the roar of
cataracts.
</p>
<p>
"Thoo dursena say me nay."
</p>
<p>
The words came from far off, from another world.
Wavering like a flame in the wind, she heard but could
make no reply.
</p>
<p>
"Thoo canna."
</p>
<p>
Then a voice spoke through her, a voice that was not
hers, coming from far away over waste seas, a voice she
had never heard before and did not recognise.
</p>
<p>
"I can—Lord Jesus helpin me."
</p>
<p>
At that the mists began to float away.  She saw more
clearly now.  The worst perhaps was over.
</p>
<p>
"You want a mon with a purpose in his life."
</p>
<p>
Ah, how well he knew her!
</p>
<p>
"A mon who knows what he wants to do and means
to do it.—And you must have it or dee.  The bairns arena
enough for a woman like you."
</p>
<p>
He was putting forth the whole of his huge strength to
overwhelm her: she was aware of it and of her own
weakness.
</p>
<p>
"A've got a purpose.  You can help me fulfill it—none
else, only you.  Time was A thought A could go on alone.
You learnt me better.  A canna.  God didna make mon
that way—not <i>this</i> mon any gate.  Mon needs Woman for
his work.  A need you."
</p>
<p>
Quietly she was gathering her forces.
</p>
<p>
"Ern's my man, Joe," she repeated.  "I need him;
and none other."
</p>
<p>
Baffled for the moment, her assailant paused in his
assault.
</p>
<p>
"And has Ern got a purpose in his life?"
</p>
<p>
"He has now."
</p>
<p>
"What's that then?"
</p>
<p>
"What you said at the Citadel that Sunday—the
war, and what it stands for."
</p>
<p>
"The war won't last for ever.  What when that's over?"
</p>
<p>
"He'll come back a made man."
</p>
<p>
He regarded her with a kind of sardonic pity.
</p>
<p>
"He'll never coom back—never."
</p>
<p>
She lifted her eyes to his, steadfast and tender.
</p>
<p>
"Hap he'll not, Joe.  If so be he doosn't, I shan't
grudge him.  A soldier in a soldier's grave.  Liefer that
than he should linger here now.  He's such a battler, Ern
is.  That's why I love him."
</p>
<p>
He took the blows she dealt him, unflinching.
</p>
<p>
"You don't loov, Ern."
</p>
<p>
"I'm learning to."
</p>
<p>
His lips curled in scorn.
</p>
<p>
"You don't know what loov is.  See here!—This is
loov."  He tapped his outspread palm, as often when
lecturing.
</p>
<p>
"Ern's ma familiar friend—has been for years.  He
trusts me—look at what he did that last night.  And
sitha!  A'm a mon men do trust.  That's ma reputation—earned
too.  A never sold a pal yet, big or little.  And
now—A'll betray ma own mate behind his back; ma mate
that's gone fightin ma battles in the cause for which A've
lived twenty years; ma mate that trusts me—and all for
the sake of loov."  The great fellow was trembling himself
now.  "Am A a rotter?—You know A'm none.  Am A
a mon?  You know A am.  The measure o ma sin is the
measure o ma loov.  Judge for yourself."
</p>
<p>
He was battening down the furnace behind steel-doors;
but she could hear the roar of the flames.
</p>
<p>
"That's loov.  A'll lose all to win all; and A've more
than most to lose.  A'll lose ma life to save ma
soul—and that's you.  Are you for it?—Was a time A thought
nowt o women: now A think o nought but the One Woman....
Now then!—Take it or leave it!—Choose
your path!—Will you throw a loov like that away—the
loov of a mon—for what?—A chap you don't
trust, a chap you can't respect, a chap who's let
you and the children down and will again, a chap you're
never like to see again—a feeble feckless sot, and son of
a sot—"
</p>
<p>
She put both hands to her ears.  He wrenched them
fiercely aside and held them.  She stood before him, her
hands imprisoned in his, her eyes shut, on her face the look
of one awaiting the blows about to rain down in her
defencelessness.
</p>
<p>
"I may ha doubted him once, Joe.  But I knaw him
better now.  May he forgive me—and you too; all the
wrong I done you both.  I knaw him, and myself, better
than I did a while back.  And now he's won me, I'll never
loose him, <i>never</i>."
</p>
<p>
She spoke with a passion which convinced even that
stubborn lover.
</p>
<p>
He drew back, and she knew from the sound of his
breathing that she had beaten him.
</p>
<p>
"Then you was playin wi me?"
</p>
<p>
He brooded over her, sullen and smouldering.
</p>
<p>
She put out her hands to him with something of the
appeal of a child.
</p>
<p>
"Hap a while back when you called me so strong
I <i>did</i> answer you—more'n I should—not knawin you
cared so much, Joe.  And may be I thart if Ernie saw
there was anudder man around hap it'd ginger him jealous
and help us along.  I was fighting for my home ... and
my children ... and for him, Joe.... And when
a woman's fighting..."
</p>
<p>
She broke off and gasped.
</p>
<p>
He met her remorselessly.
</p>
<p>
"Then yo've chosen ... It's goodbye."
</p>
<p>
She laid her hands upon his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
"But not like that.—Kiss me, Joe."
</p>
<p>
She lifted her face.
</p>
<p>
Slowly he dropped his hands upon her arms.
</p>
<p>
And as they stood thus, entwined, the window opened
quickly from outside, the curtains parted, and a voice
low at first and rising to a horrible scream shrilled,
</p>
<p>
"Caught em at it!—<i>Mr. Spink</i>.—Come and see
</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><a id="chap40"></a></p>
<h3>
CHAPTER XL
<br><br>
VICTORY AND REVENGE
</h3>
<p>
In the fury of his excitement Alf thrust his head and
shoulders far into the room.
</p>
<p>
"Got you this time!" he screamed to Joe, his face
distorted with hate.  "<i>Mr. Spink!</i>" he cried to somebody
who must have been near by.
</p>
<p>
The engineer made a grab at him and seized him by the
head.
</p>
<p>
"Got <i>you</i>, ye mean!" he bellowed and jerked the other
bodily into the room.  "Ah, ye dirty spyin tyke!—I'll
learn you!"
</p>
<p>
He heaved his enemy from his knees to his feet and
closed with him.  The struggle was that of a parrot in the
clutch of a tiger.
</p>
<p>
Joe carried his enemy to the door and slung him out
head first.  Alf brought up with a bang against a big car
which had just drawn up outside.
</p>
<p>
A little lady sat in it.
</p>
<p>
"Will you get out of my way, please?" she said coldly
to the man sprawling on his hands and knees in the dust at
her feet, as she proceeded to descend.
</p>
<p>
The prostrate man raised his eyes and blinked.  The
lady passed him by as she might have passed a dead puppy
lying in the road.
</p>
<p>
Joe crossed the path and examined with a certain
detached interest, the door of the car against which Alf's
head had crashed.
</p>
<p>
"Why, yo've made quite a dent in your nice car,"
he said.  "Pity."  And he walked away down the street
after Mr. Spink who was retiring discreetly round the
corner.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor entered the cottage.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was sitting in the kitchen, her hands in her lap,
dazed.
</p>
<p>
The lady went over to her.
</p>
<p>
"It's all right, Ruth," she said gently in the other's
ear.
</p>
<p>
Slowly Ruth recovered and poured the tale of the last
twenty-four hours into the ear of her friend.  It was the
cruelty of her mother-in-law more than anything else that
troubled her: for it was to her significant of the attitude
of the world.
</p>
<p>
"That's her!" she said.  "And that's them!—and
that's how it is!"
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lewknor comforted her; but Ruth refused to be
comforted.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you don't know em," she said.  "But I been
through it, me and little Alice.  See I'm alone again now
Ernie's gone.  And so they got me.  And they know it
and take advantage—and Mrs. Caspar, that sly and cruel,
she leads em on."
</p>
<p>
"I think perhaps she's not as bad as she likes to make
herself out," Mrs. Lewknor answered.
</p>
<p>
She opened her bag, took out a letter, and put it in
Ruth's hand.  It was from Anne Caspar, angular as the
writer in phrase alike and penmanship, and in the
pseudo-business vein of the daughter of the Ealing tobacconist.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
<i>Dear Madam,—If your Committee can help Mrs. Caspar
in the Moot, board for herself and four children, I will pay
rent of same.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Yours faithfully,<br>
          Anne Caspar.</i><br>
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Later just as twilight began to fall Ruth went up to
Rectory Walk.  Anne was standing on the patch of lawn
in front of the little house amid her tobacco plants,
sweet-scented in the dusk, a shawl drawn tight about her gaunt
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Ruth halted on the path outside.
</p>
<p>
"I do thank you, Mrs. Caspar," she said, deep and
quivering.
</p>
<p>
The elder woman did not look at her, did not invite her
in.  She tugged at the ends of her shawl and sniffed the
evening with her peculiar smirk.
</p>
<p>
"Must have a roof over them, I suppose," she said.
"Even in war-time."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The visit of Mrs. Trupp and Mrs. Lewknor to the Registrar
at Lewes had proved entirely satisfactory.  No marriage
had taken place on the day in question, so examination
disclosed.  Mrs. Lewknor reported as much to her husband
on her return home that evening.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel grinned the grin of an ogre about to take
his evening meal of well-cooked children.
</p>
<p>
"We must twist Master Alf's tail," he said; "and
not forget we owe him one ourselves."
</p>
<p>
At the next Committee meeting, which the Colonel
attended, there was heavy fighting between the Army
and the Church; and after it even graver trouble between
Alf and the Reverend Spink.
</p>
<p>
"It's not only my reputation," cried the indignant
curate.  "It's the credit of the Church you've shaken."
</p>
<p>
"I know nothing only the facts," retorted Alf doggedly—"if
they're any good to you.  I drove them there
meself—14th September, 1906, four o'clock of a Saturday
afternoon and a bit foggy like.  You can see it in the
entry-book for yourself.  They went into the Registrar's office
single, and they walked out double, half-an-hour later.
I see em myself, and you can't get away from the facts
of your eyes, not even a clergyman can't."
</p>
<p>
Alf was additionally embittered because he felt that
the curate had left him disgracefully in the lurch in the
incident of the Moot.  The Reverend Spink on his
side—somewhat dubious in his heart of the part he had played
on the fringe of that affair—felt that by taking the strong and
righteous line now he was vindicating himself in his own
eyes at least for any short-comings then.
</p>
<p>
"I shall report the whole thing to the Archdeacon,"
he said.  "It's a scandal.  He'll deal with you."
</p>
<p>
"Report it then!" snapped Alf.  "If the Church
don't want me, neether don't I want the Church."
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The war was killing the Archdeacon, as Mr. Trupp had
said it must.
</p>
<p>
The flames of his indomitable energy were devouring
the old gentleman for all the world to see.  He was going
down to his grave, as he would have wished, to the roll of
drums and roar of artillery.
</p>
<p>
Thus when the Reverend Spink went up to the Rectory
to report on the delinquencies of the sidesman, he found his
chief in bed and obviously spent.
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman made a pathetic figure attempting
to maintain his dignity in a night-gown obviously too small
for him, which served to emphasize his failing mortality.
</p>
<p>
His face was ghastly save for a faint dis-colouration
about one eye; but he was playing his part royally still.
His bitterest enemy must have admired his courage; his
severest critic might have wept, so pitiful was the old man's
make-believe.
</p>
<p>
On a table at his side were all the pathetic little
properties that made the man.  There was his snuff-box; there
the filigree chain; a scent-bottle; a rosary; a missal.
On his bed was the silver-mounted ebony cane; and beneath
his pillow, artfully concealed to show, the butt-end of his
pistol.
</p>
<p>
Over his head was the photograph of a man whom the
curate recognised instantly as Sir Edward Carson; and
beneath the photograph was an illuminated text which on
closer scrutiny turned out to be the Solemn League and
Covenant.
</p>
<p>
Facing the great Unionist Leader on the opposite wall
was the Emperor of the French.  The likeness between
the two famous Imperialists was curiously marked; and
they seemed aware of it, staring across the room at each
other over the body of their prostrate admirer with intimacy,
understanding, mutual admiration.  Almost you expected
them to wink at each other—a knowing wink.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spink now told his chief the whole story as it affected
Alf.  Much of it the Archdeacon had already heard from
his wife.
</p>
<p>
"I'd better see him," he now said grimly.
</p>
<p>
And the Archdeacon was not the only one who wanted
to see Alf just then.  That afternoon, just as he was
starting out with the car, he was called up on the telephone.
</p>
<p>
The Director of Recruiting wished to see him at the
Town Hall—to-morrow—11 a.m., sharp.  The voice was
peremptory and somehow familiar.  Alf was perturbed.
What was up now?
</p>
<p>
"Who is the Director of Recruiting here?" he asked
Mr. Trupp a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
"Colonel Lewknor," the old surgeon answered.  "Just
appointed.  All you young men of military age come under
him now."
</p>
<p>
Alf winced.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The Colonel's office was in the Town Hall, and one of
the first men to come and sign on there was Joe Burt.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel, as he took in the engineer, saw at once
that the hurricane which was devastating the world had
wrought its will upon this man too.  The Joe Burt he had
originally known four years ago stood before him once again,
surly, shy, and twinkling.
</p>
<p>
"Good luck to you," said the Colonel as they shook
hands.  "And try to be an honest man.  You were meant
to be, you know."
</p>
<p>
"A'm as honest as soom and honester than most, A
reckon," the engineer answered dogged as a badgered
schoolboy.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel essayed to look austere.
</p>
<p>
"You'd better go before you get into worse trouble,"
he said.
</p>
<p>
Joe went out, grinning.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, A'm not the only one," he mumbled.
</p>
<p>
Outside in the passage he met Alf, and paused amazed.
</p>
<p>
"You goin to enlist!" he roared.  "Never!" and
marched on, his laughter rollicking down the corridor like
a huge wind.
</p>
<p>
Alf entered the Colonel's office delicately: he had
reasons of his own to fear everything that wore khaki.
</p>
<p>
The Colonel sat at his desk like a death's head, a trail
of faded medal-ribands running across his khaki chest.
</p>
<p>
He was thin, spectral, almost cadaverous.  But his
voice was gentle, as always; his manner as always, most
courteous.  Nothing could be more remote from the
truculence of the Army manner of tradition.
</p>
<p>
He was the spider talking to the fly.
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid this is a very serious matter, Mr. Caspar,"
he began; and it was a favourite opening of his.  "It
seems you've been taking away the character of the wife of
a member of His Majesty's forces now in France..."
</p>
<p>
The interview lasted some time, and it was the Colonel
who did the talking.
</p>
<p>
"And now I won't detain you further, Mr. Caspar,"
he said at the end.  "My clerk in the next room will take
all your particulars for our index card register, so that
we needn't bother you again when conscription comes."
</p>
<p>
"Conscription!" cried Alf, changing colour.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied the Colonel.  "There's been no public
announcement yet.  But there's no reason you shouldn't
know it's coming.  It's got to."
</p>
<p>
Alf went out as a man goes to execution.  He returned
to his now almost deserted garage to find there a note from
the Archdeacon asking him to be good enough to call at
the Rectory that afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Alf stood at the window and looked out with dull eyes.
Now that the earth which three weeks since had felt so solid
beneath his feet was crumbling away beneath him, he
needed the backing of the Church more than ever; and
for all his brave words to Mr. Spink, he was determined
not to relinquish his position in it without a fight.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon he walked slowly up the hill to the
Rectory.
</p>
<p>
Outside the white gate he stood in the road under the
sycamore trees, gathering courage to make the plunge.
</p>
<p>
If was five o'clock.
</p>
<p>
A man got off the bus at Billing's Corner and came
down the road towards him.  Alf was aware of him, but
did not at first see who he was.
</p>
<p>
"Not gone yet then?" said the man.
</p>
<p>
"No," Alf answered.  "Got about as far as you—and
that ain't very far."
</p>
<p>
"I'm on the way," answered Joe.  "Going up to the
camp in Summerdown now; and join up this evening."
</p>
<p>
"Ah," said Alf.  "I'll believe it when I see it."
</p>
<p>
Swag on back, Joe tramped sturdily on towards the Downs.
</p>
<p>
Alf watched him.  Then a gate clicked; and Edward
Caspar came blundering down the road.  Alf in his
loneliness was drawn towards him.
</p>
<p>
"Good evening, father," he said.
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman blinked vaguely through his
spectacles, and answered most courteously,
</p>
<p>
"Good evening, Mr. Er-um-ah!" and rolled on down
the road.
</p>
<p>
So his own father didn't know him!
</p>
<p>
Overhead an aeroplane buzzed by.  From the coombe
came the eternal noise of the hammers as the great camp
there took shape.  Along Summerdown Road at the end
of Rectory Walk a long convoy of Army Service Corps
wagons with mule-teams trailed by.  A big motor passed
him.  In it was Stanley Bessemere and three staff-officers
with red bands round their caps.  They were very pleased
with themselves and their cigars.  The member for Beachbourne
West did not see his supporter.  Then there sounded
the tramp of martial feet.  It was Saturday afternoon.
The Old Town Company of Volunteers, middle-aged men
for the most part, known to Alf from childhood, was
marching by on the way to drill on the Downs.  A fierce
short man was in charge.  Three rough chevrons had been
sewn on to his sleeve to mark his rank as sergeant; and he
wore a belt tightly buckled about his ample waist.  All
carried dummy rifles.
</p>
<p>
"Left-right, left-right," called the sergeant in the
voice of a drill-instructor of the Guards.  "Mark time in
front!  Forward!  Dressing by your left!"
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Pigott.
</p>
<p>
Alf's eyes followed the little party up the road.  Then
they fell on his home covered with ampelopsis just beginning
to turn.  His mother was at the window, looking at him.
Whether it was that the glass distorted her face, or that
his own vision was clouded, it seemed to Alf that she was
mocking him.  Then she drew down the blind as though
to shut him out—his own mother.
</p>
<p>
Alf shivered.
</p>
<p>
A young woman coming from Billing's Corner crossed
the road to him.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Alf," she said gaily, "you're getting em all
against you!"
</p>
<p>
Alf raised his eyes to hers, and they were the eyes of
the rabbit in the burrow with the stoat hard upon its
heels.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said more to himself than her.  "Reckon
I'm done."

<h3>
THE COMFORTER
</h3>
<p>
Ruth passed down the lane towards the golf links, the
laughter sparkling in her brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
She was merry, malicious, mischievously prim.  Then
suddenly, as at the shutting of a door, her mood changed.
Something warm and large and tremulous surged up
unbidden out of the ocean-deeps of her.
</p>
<p>
To her own amazement she found herself sorry for the
forlorn little figure with the eyes haunting and haunted,
she had left standing in the road outside the Rectory
gate.
</p>
<p>
A sense of the dramatic vicissitudes of life caught her
by the throat.  Three weeks ago that little man had been
conquering the world with a swagger, the master of
circumstance, over-riding destiny, sweeping obstacles aside,
a domineer, with all the attributes of his kind—brutal,
blatant, sure of himself, indifferent to others, scornful of
the humble.  Now he stood there at the cross-roads like
some old tramp of the world, uncertain which way to turn—a
mouse tossed overboard in mid-Atlantic by the cook's
boy, the sport of tides and breakers, swimming round and
round with ghastly eyes in ever-shortening circle.
</p>
<p>
The tempest which had all the world in grip, which
had snatched Ernie from her arms, and hurled him across
the seas, which had set millions of men to killing and being
killed, had caught this insignificant gnat too, flying with
such a fuss and buzz of wings under ominous skies, and then
swaggered on its great way indifferent to the tiny creature
it had crushed.
</p>
<p>
Ruth crossed the links, almost deserted now, and
walked along over the crisp smooth turf, her eyes on the
township of yellow huts rising out of the green in the great
coombe across Summerdown Road.
</p>
<p>
Then she was aware of Mr. Chislehurst coming swiftly
towards her beside the ha-ha of the Duke's Lodge.
He looked, Ruth noticed at once, less harassed than he had
done since the outbreak of war.
</p>
<p>
"I am glad I've met you, Mrs. Caspar," he began with
the old boyish enthusiasm.  "I'm off to-morrow and wasn't
sure I should have time to come round and say goodbye
to you and the babes."
</p>
<p>
Ruth stared.
</p>
<p>
"<i>You're</i> never going out there, sir!"
</p>
<p>
"Only as military chaplain."
</p>
<p>
Ruth refused to believe.
</p>
<p>
"But I thart you was against war and all that."
</p>
<p>
"So I am," Bobby answered gravely.  He looked
away towards Paradise.  "But I feel Our Lord is there,
or nowhere—just now."
</p>
<p>
Ruth felt profoundly moved.  The young man's words,
his action, brought home to her with a sudden pang, as not
even the departure of Ernie had done, the change that had
rushed upon the world.
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked at the smooth young face before her,
brown and goodly, with all the hope and promise of the
future radiant in it.
</p>
<p>
A passionate desire to take the boy in her arms, to
shield him, to cry—You <i>shan't!</i> came over her.  Then
she gulped and said,
</p>
<p>
"Goodbye, sir," and moved on rapidly.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
Passing through Meads, she turned the shoulder of the
hill, and walked along the cliff, till she came to the long
low house in the coombe.
</p>
<p>
It had a strangely deserted air, no spinal chairs and
perambulators on the terrace, no nurses on the lawns,
no beds on the balconies.  All that busyness of quiet
recreation which had been going on here for some years past
had been brought to a sudden halt.  Mrs. Lewknor came
out to her and the two women sat a while on the terrace,
talking.  They had drawn very close in these few days,
the regiment an ever-present bond between them.  The
husband of one was "out there" with the 1st battalion;
the son of the other was racing home with the 2nd battalion
in the Indian Contingent.  Mrs. Lewknor felt a comfortable
sense that once the two battalions were aligned
on the West Front all would be well.
</p>
<p>
"Then let em all come!" the little lady said in her
heart with almost vindictive glee.
</p>
<p>
As Ruth left she saw the Colonel in khaki, returning
from his office.  He came stalking along the cliff, his head
on his left shoulder, looking seawards.  There was about
the gaunt old man that air of austere exaltation which
had marked him from the moment of the outbreak of war.
In his ears, indeed, ever since that hour, there had sounded
a steady note, deep and pulsing like the throb of an
engine—the heart of England beating on, beating eternally,
tireless, true, from generation to generation.
</p>
<p>
And for one brief moment he had doubted her—might
God forgive him!
</p>
<p>
Ruth asked him how recruiting was going.
</p>
<p>
"Well," replied the Colonel.  "They're flocking in—men
of all ages, classes, and creeds.  I shipped off Burt
this morning; and he's forty.  Wanted to join the Hammer-men
or Manchesters with his friend Tawney; but I said
<i>No: every man his own job</i>, and sent him off to the flying
folk as air-mechanic.  He's joining up at Newhaven to-night,
and in a week he'll be out there."
</p>
<p>
Ruth asked if there was any news of the Expeditionary
Force.
</p>
<p>
"They're landed all right," the Colonel replied.  "We
should soon hear more.  Our battalion's with the Fourth
Division.  If you go up on the Head you can see the
transports crossing from Newhaven with the stuff."
</p>
<p>
"Think it'll be all right, sir?" asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
"If we can stop their first rush," the Colonel answered.
"Every day tells.  We can't be too thankful for Liége,
though Namur's a nasty knock."
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked across the sea.
</p>
<p>
"I wish we could do something for em," she said wistfully.
</p>
<p>
"We can," answered the Colonel sharply, almost
sternly.
</p>
<p>
The old soldier took off his cap and stood there bare-headed
on the edge of the white cliff, the wisps of silver
hair lifting in the evening breeze.
</p>
<p>
"May the God of our fathers be with them in the day
of battle!" he prayed, and added with quiet assurance
as he covered again—"He will too."
</p>
<p>
Then he asked the woman at his side if she had heard
from her husband.
</p>
<p>
Ruth dropped her eyes, sudden and secretive as a child.
</p>
<p>
"Ern's all right, I reckon," she said casually.
</p>
<p>
In fact a letter from him on the eve of sailing lay
unopened in her pocket.  She was treasuring it jealously,
as a child treasures a sweet, to devour it with due ritual
at the appointed hour in the appropriate place.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later she was standing waist-deep in the
gorse of the Ambush looking about her.
</p>
<p>
Far away a silver-bellied air-ship was patrolling leisurely
somewhere over the Rother Valley; and once she heard
a loud explosion seawards and knew it for a mine.
</p>
<p>
Like a hind on the fell-side she stood up there, sniffing
the wind.  Behind her on the far horizon was a forest
fire.  She could smell it, see the glow of it, and the rumour
of its coming was all a-round her: overhead the whistle
and pipe of birds hard-driven, while under-foot the heather
was alive with the stealthy migration of the under-world—adder
and weasel, snake and hare, flying from the torment
to come.  But for her as yet the conflagration devouring
the world was but an ominous red glare across the water.
She breathed freely: for she had shaken off her immediate
enemy—the Hunter.
</p>
<p>
Then she looked up and saw a man coming over the brow
of Warren Hill towards her.
</p>
<p>
She dropped as though shot.
</p>
<p>
<i>He</i> was at her heels again.  Face down, flat on the earth,
she lay panting in her form.
</p>
<p>
And as she crouched there, listening to the thumping
of her own heart, she was aware of another sound that
came rollicking down to her, born on the wind.  The Hunter
was laughing, that huge gusty laughter of his she knew so
well.  Had he tracked her down?
</p>
<p>
She heard his feet approaching on the turf.  Was the
earth trembling at the touch of them or was it the beating
of her own heart that shook it?
</p>
<p>
Prone on the ground, spying through the roots of the
gorse, she could see those feet—those solid familiar boots
that had dangled so often before her fire; and the bottoms
of the trousers, frayed at the edges and rather short,
betraying the absence of a woman's care.
</p>
<p>
Was it her he was after?
</p>
<p>
No: he passed, still rollicking.  He was not mocking
her: he was tossing off his chest in cascades of giant laughter
the seas that had so long threatened to overwhelm him,
tossing them off into the blue in showers of spray.
</p>
<p>
<i>I am free once more</i>! that was what his laughter said.
</p>
<p>
She sat up: she knelt: warily she peeped over the
green wall.  His back was moving solidly away in the
evening, his back with the swag on it.  He reached the
flag-staff and dropped away down into Hodcombe, that lies
between Beau-nez and the Belle-tout light-house.  She
watched him till only his round dark head was visible.
Then that too disappeared.  She rose and filled her chest
as the breeze slowly fills the sails of a ship that has long
hovered uncertainly in stays.
</p>
<p>
He too was gone—into <i>IT</i>.
</p>
<p>
That Other was gone—like the rest—and the past
with him.
</p>
<p>
How queer it all was! and how differently each man
had met the huge tidal wave that had swept the whole
world off its feet!
</p>
<p>
Joe, paddling in the muddy shallows, had been caught
up, and was swimming easily now on the crest of it.  Alf,
snatched up unawares as he grubbed for bait upon the
flats, had been tumbled over and over like a pebble, smashed
down upon the remorseless beach, and drawn back with
a sickening scream by the undersuck into the murderous
riot of it.  Last of all, Ern, asleep and snoring under the
sunny sea-wall, had risen suddenly, girded on his strength,
and waded out to meet it with rejoicing heart.
</p>
<p>
Dear Ern!
</p>
<p>
Sinking down into the harbourage of this deep and
quiet covert where, under the stars, all his children,
conceived in ecstasy, had come to her, she took out his letter,
opened it, and began to read.
</p>
<p>
It was dated <i>In the train</i>, and began full of affection
for her and the children.
</p>
<p>
"Now we made it up I don't mind what comes.  I feel
like it was a new beginning.  There's a lot of married men
joined up feel the very same.  I feel uplifted like and that
whatever comes nothing can ever come atween us no
more really.  Even when it was dark I felt that—that it
wasn't <i>really real</i> between us—only a shadow like that
would surely pass away—as it has passed away—thank
God for His great mercies."
</p>
<p>
There followed love and kisses to all the children and
especially little Alice, underlined, and fraternal greetings
to old Joe.
</p>
<p>
"We shall push em back where they belong all right,
I expect.  And if we don't I shall send for him to lend a
shove.  He's all right, old Joe is.  There's not many of em
I'd trust, but you can trust him.  I knew that all along."
</p>
<p>
The letter finished,
</p>
<p>
"It's an end and a beginning, as old dad says.  And
whatever else <i>that's</i> finished, and I don't care."
</p>
<p>
It was true too.
</p>
<p>
She folded the letter and slipped it in her bosom.
</p>
<p>
The second volume of her life had ended, and ended
well.  The sudden hand of destiny had reached forth to
save her, to save the children, to save Ernie, to save Joe.
</p>
<p>
Had she ever wavered?—Who shall say?—Perhaps
she could not say herself.
</p>
<p>
She cast her mind back over her married life.  Six
years in September since she and Ern had ridden back
to Old Town in Isaac Woolgar's cart.  Six years of struggle,
worry, and deep joy.  She was thankful for them, thankful
for the crowding babes, and most of all, she sometimes
thought, thankful for Ernie ... His unfailing love
and solicitude for little Alice!  She could never be grateful
enough to him for that.  Dear Ern:—so affectionate, so
always loveable.  She regretted nothing, not even his
weakness now.  Because of his weakness strength had come
to her, growth, and the consummation of deep unconscious
desire.
</p>
<p>
Had she been too hard on him?—A great voice of comfort,
the voice of Ernie, so it seemed to her, only swollen to
gigantic proportions, till the sound of it was like the sound
of the Sou-West wind billowing through the beach-tops
in Paradise, surged up within her crying No.
</p>
<p>
Then she turned back to the first volume of her life,
completed now so many years ago.
</p>
<p>
For the second time she had been left thus, man-less,
a new life quickening within her.  But what a difference
between then and now!  Then the fierce thief of her
virginity had stolen away in the night, leaving her to meet
the consequences, alone, an outcast, the hand of all men
against her; and she recalled now with a shudder the
afternoon on which she had gone forth to the Crumbles and
there amid the jeers of the remorseless sea had faced the
situation.  Now it was true her accustomed mate had been
snatched from her side; but the world was behind her.
She was marching with the hosts, a mighty concourse,
one of them, and uplifted on their songs.
</p>
<p>
She had nothing to fear, much to be thankful for.  How
calm she felt, how strong, how confident of herself, above
all of Ernie!  His punishment had made him and completed
her own life.  She had won her man and in winning him
had won herself.  And she would never lose him now.
His pain, her pain, had been worth while.  Smiles were
in her eyes as she recalled the fuss that he had made—his
struggles, his temper, his wiles of a naughty and thwarted
child; and tears where she recalled the anguish of his time
of purgation.  And yet because of his suffering he had been
strong when the day of battle came, and he would be strong.
She had no doubt of that.  And it was all over now.
</p>
<p>
Rising she stood up and looked about her, absorbing
the down-land, familiar and beloved from childhood.  The
sky, grey now and mottled, drooped about her quietly with
the soft wings of a mothering bird settling soft-breasted
on her nest.  The good green earth, firm beneath her feet,
lifted her up into the quiet refuge of that welcoming bosom,
lifted her to meet it like a wave gently swelling.  So it had
always been: so it always would be.  This earth she knew
and loved so well was not alien, it was not hostile; rather
it was flesh of her flesh and soul of her soul.  It gave her
strength and comfort.  Her bosom rose and fell in time,
so it seemed to her, with the rise and fall of the breast
of this virgin-mother, whose goodness she assimilated
through heart and eyes and nostrils.  She felt utterly at
home.  All sense of separation, of dissent, had left her.
</p>
<p>
Absorbed she stood, and absorbing.
</p>
<p>
These woman-bodied hills, sparsely clad in rags of gorse
that served only to enhance their loveliness, brought her
solace and content as did nothing else.  So it had always
been: so it always would be.  The beauty and wonder
of them rolled in upon her in waves of sound-less music,
sluicing over the sands of her life in foaming sheets of
hyacinth, drowning the resentment, filling and fulfilling
her with the grand harmony of life.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes down in the Moot, amid the worry, and the
tumult, and the exasperations, she became empty, a discord,
a desert.  Then she would get away for an hour among
the hills and her parched spirit found instant refreshment.
She brimmed again.  The quiet, the comfort, the deep
abiding wonder of it all came back to her; even the words
which she always associated with it—<i>I am the Resurrection
and the Life</i>.
</p>
<p>
Since Ernie's departure the Comforter had come thus
to her with renewed power; as if knowing her need and
resolute to fortify her in the hour of her ordeal.
</p>
<p>
Standing there upon the brow, Ernie's letter lying like
his hand upon her breast in the old dear way, she gazed
across the waters, dimming in the dusk, and sent out her
heart towards him, strong and pulsing as the sun's rays
at dawn seen by some mountaineer from his native peak.
She could shield him so that no evil thing could come
nigh him.  She had no fear for him and was amazed at
her own triumphant faith.
</p>
<p>
Established on the rock herself, earth in earth, spirit
in spirit, invincibly secure, she had him safe in her keeping,
safe, aye safe as his child quickening in the warm and
sheltered darkness of her womb.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method

    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div><div>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
