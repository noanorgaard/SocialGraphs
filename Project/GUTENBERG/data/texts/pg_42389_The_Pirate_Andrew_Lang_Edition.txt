<h2>EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION<br><br>
<span class="ft60">TO</span><br><br>
THE PIRATE.</h2>
<p>The circumstances in which “The Pirate” was composed have for the Editor
a peculiar interest. He has many times scribbled at the old bureau in
Chiefswood whereon Sir Walter worked at his novel, and sat in summer
weather beneath the great tree on the lawn where Erskine used to read
the fresh chapters to Lockhart and his wife, while the burn murmured by
from the Rhymer’s Glen. So little altered is the cottage of Chiefswood
by the addition of a gabled wing in the same red stone as the older
portion, so charmed a quiet has the place, in the shelter of Eildon
Hill, that there one can readily beget the golden time again, and think
oneself back into the day when Mustard and Spice, running down the shady
glen, might herald the coming of the Sheriff himself. Happy hours and
gone: like that summer of 1821, whereof Lockhart speaks with an emotion
the more touching because it is so rare,—</p>
<div class="psmall">
<p class="noidt">the first of several seasons, which will ever dwell on my memory
as the happiest of my life. We were near enough Abbotsford to
partake as often as we liked of its brilliant society; yet could
do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit
which the daily reception of new visitors entailed upon all the
society except Sir Walter himself. But, in truth, even he was not
always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of
open-house-keeping. Even his temper sank sometimes under the
solemn applause of learned dulness, the vapid raptures of painted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
and periwigged dowagers the horse-leech avidity with which
underbred foreigners urged their questions, and the pompous
simpers of condescending magnates. When sore beset in this way, he
would every now and then discover that he had some very particular
business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate, and,
craving the indulgence of his guests overnight, appear at the
cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the
morning. The clatter of Sibyl Grey’s hoofs, the yelping of Mustard
and Spice, and his own joyous shout of <i>reveillée</i> under our
window, were the signal that he had burst his bonds, and meant for
that day to take his ease in his inn.... After breakfast he would
take possession of a dressing-room upstairs, and write a chapter
of “The Pirate”; and then, having made up and dispatched his
parcel for Mr. Ballantyne, away to join Purdie where the foresters
were at work....</p>
<p>The constant and eager delight with which Erskine watched the
progress of the tale has left a deep impression on my memory: and
indeed I heard so many of its chapters first read from the MS. by
him, that I can never open the book now without thinking I hear
his voice. Sir Walter used to give him at breakfast the pages he
had written that morning, and very commonly, while he was again at
work in his study, Erskine would walk over to Chiefswood, that he
might have the pleasure of reading them aloud to my wife and me
under our favourite tree.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<p>“The tree is living yet!” This long quotation from a book but too little
read in general may be excused for its interest, as bearing on the
composition of “The Pirate,” in the early autumn of 1821. In “The
Pirate” Scott fell back on his recollections of the Orcades, as seen by
him in a tour with the Commissioners of Light Houses, in August 1814,
immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> the publication of “Waverley.” They were accompanied
by Mr. Stevenson, the celebrated engineer, “a most gentlemanlike and
modest man, and well known by his scientific skill.”<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a> It is understood
that Mr. Stevenson also kept a diary, and that it is to be published by
the care of his distinguished grandson, Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson,
author of “Kidnapped,” “The Master of Ballantrae,” and other novels in
which Scott would have recognised a not alien genius.</p>
<p>Sir Walter’s Diary, read in company with “The Pirate,” offers a most
curious study of his art in composition. It may be said that he scarcely
noted a natural feature, a monument, a custom, a superstition, or a
legend in Zetland and Orkney which he did not weave into the magic web
of his romance. In the Diary all those matters appear as very ordinary;
in “The Pirate” they are transfigured in the light of fancy. History
gives Scott the career of Gow and his betrothal to an island lady:
observation gives him a few headlands, Picts’ houses, ruined towers, and
old stone monuments, and his characters gather about these, in rhythmic
array, like the dancers in the sword-dance. We may conceive that
Cleveland, like Gow, was originally meant to die, and that Minna, like
Margaret in the ballad of Clerk Saunders, was to recover her troth from
the hand of her dead lover. But, if Scott intended this, he was
good-natured, and relented.</p>
<p>Taking the incidents in the Diary in company with the novel, we find, in
the very first page of “The Pirate,” mention of the roost, or rost, of
Sumburgh, the running current of tidal water, which he hated so, because
it made him so sea-sick. “All the landsmen sicker than sick, and our
Viceroy, Stevenson, qualmish. It is proposed to have a light on Sumburgh
Head.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> Fitful Head is higher, but is to the west, from which quarter few
vessels come.” As for Sumburgh Head, Scott climbed it, rolled down a
rock from the summit, and found it “a fine situation to compose an ode
to the Genius of Sumburgh Head, or an Elegy upon a Cormorant—or to have
written or spoken madness of any kind in prose or poetry. But I gave
vent to my excited feelings in a more simple way, and, sitting gently
down on the steep green slope which led to the beach, I e’en slid down a
few hundred feet, and found the exercise quite an adequate vent to my
enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>Sir Walter was certainly not what he found Mrs. Hemans, “too poetical.”</p>
<p>In the first chapter, his Giffords, Scotts (of Scotstarvet, the
Fifeshire house, not of the Border clan), and Mouats are the very gentry
who entertained him on his tour. His “plantie cruives,” in the novel,
had been noted in the Diary (Lockhart, iv. 193). “Pate Stewart,” the
oppressive Earl, is chronicled at length in “the Diary.” “His huge tower
remains wild and desolate—its chambers filled with sand, and its rifted
walls and dismantled battlements giving unrestrained access to the
roaring sea-blast.” So Scott wrote in his last review for the
“Quarterly,” a criticism of Pitcairn’s “Scotch Criminal Trials” (1831).
The Trows, or Drows, the fairy dwarfs he studied on the spot, and
connects the name with Dwerg, though <i>Trolls</i> seem rather to be their
spiritual and linguistic ancestors. The affair of the clergyman who was
taken for a Pecht, or Pict, actually occurred during the tour, and Mr.
Stevenson, who had met the poor Pecht before, was able to clear his
character.<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> In the same place the Kraken is mentioned: he had been
visible for nearly a fortnight, but no sailor dared go near him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lay in the offing a fortnight or more,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the devil a Zetlander put from the shore.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If your Grace thinks I’m writing the thing that is not,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may ask at a namesake of ours, Mr. Scott,</span><br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">Sir Walter wrote to the Duke of Buccleugh. He paid a visit to an old
lady, who, like Norna, and Æolus in the Odyssey, kept the winds in a
bag, and could sell a fair breeze. “She was a miserable figure, upwards
of ninety, she told me, and dried up like a mummy. A sort of
clay-coloured cloak, folded over her head, corresponded in colour to her
corpse-like complexion. Fine light-blue eyes, and nose and chin that
almost met, and a ghastly expression of cunning gave her quite the
effect of Hecate. She told us she remembered <i>Gow the Pirate</i>, betrothed
to a Miss Gordon,”—so here are the germs of Norna, Cleveland, and
Minna, all sown in good ground, to bear fruit in seven years
(1814-1821). Triptolemus Yellowley is entirely derived from the Diary,
and is an anachronism. The Lowland Scots factors and ploughs were only
coming in while Scott was in the isles. He himself saw the absurd little
mills (vol. i. ch. xi.), and the one stilted plough which needed two
women to open the furrows, a feebler plough than the Virgilian specimens
which one still remarks in Tuscany. “When this precious machine was in
motion, it was dragged by four little bullocks, yoked abreast, and as
many ponies harnessed, or rather strung, to the plough by ropes and
thongs of raw hide.... An antiquary might be of opinion that this was
the very model of the original plough invented by Triptolemus,” son of
the Eleusinian king, who sheltered Demeter in her wanderings. The
sword-dance was not danced for Scott’s entertainment, but he heard of
the Pupa dancers, and got a copy of the accompanying chant, and was
presented with examples of the flint and bronze Celts which Norna
treasured. All over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> world, as in Zetland, they were regarded as
“thunder stones.” (Diary; Lockhart, iv. 220.) The bridal of Norna, by
clasping of hands through Odin’s stone ring, was still practised as a
form of betrothal. (Lockhart, iv. 252.) Some island people were
despised, as by Magnus Troil, as “poor sneaks” who ate limpets, “the
last of human meannesses.” The “wells,” or smooth wave-currents, were
also noted, and the <i>Garland</i> of the whalers often alluded to in the
tale. The Stones of Stennis were visited, and the Dwarfie Stone of Hoy,
where Norna, like some Eskimo Angekok, met her familiar demon. Scott
held that the stone “probably was meant as the temple of some northern
edition of the <i>dii Manes</i>. They conceive that the dwarf may be seen
sometimes sitting at the door of his abode, but he vanishes on a nearer
approach.” The dwelling of Norna, a Pict’s house, with an overhanging
story, “shaped like a dice-box,” is the ancient Castle of Mousa.<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a> The
strange incantation of Norna, the dropping of molten lead into water, is
also described. Usually the lead was poured through the wards of a key.
In affections of the heart, like Minna’s, a triangular stone, probably a
neolithic arrow-head, was usually employed as an amulet. (Lockhart, iv.
208.) Even the story of the pirate’s insolent answer to the Provost is
adapted from a recent occurrence. Two whalers were accused of stealing a
sheep. The first denied the charge, but said he had seen the animal
carried off by “a fellow with a red nose and a black wig. Don’t you
think he was like his honour, Tom?” “By God, Jack, I believe it was the
very man.” (Diary; Lockhart, iv. 222; “The Pirate,” vol. ii. ch. xiv.)
The goldless Northern Ophir was also visited—in brief, Scott scarcely
made a remark on his tour which he did not manage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> transmute into the
rare metal of his romance. It is no wonder that the Orcadians at once
detected his authorship. A trifling anecdote of the cruise has recently
been published. Scott presented a lady in the isles with a piano, which,
it seems, is still capable of producing a melancholy jingling tune.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Lockhart says, as to the reception of “The Pirate” (Dec. 1821): “The
wild freshness of the atmosphere of this splendid romance, the beautiful
contrast of Minna and Brenda, and the exquisitely drawn character of
Captain Cleveland, found the reception which they deserved.” “The wild
freshness of the atmosphere” is indeed magically transfused, and
breathes across the pages as it blows over the Fitful Head, the
skerries, the desolate moors, the plain of the Standing Stones of
Stennis. The air is keen and salt and fragrant of the sea. Yet Sydney
Smith was greatly disappointed. “I am afraid this novel will depend upon
the former reputation of the author, and will add nothing to it. It may
sell, and another may half sell, but that is all, unless he comes out
with something vigorous, and redeems himself. I do not blame him for
writing himself out, if he knows he is doing so, and has done his
<i>best</i>, and his <i>all</i>. If the native land of Scotland will supply no
more scenes and characters, for he is always best in Scotland, though he
was very good in England the (time) he was there; but pray, wherever the
scene is laid, no more Meg Merrilies and Dominie Sampsons—very good the
first and second times, but now quite worn out, and always recurring.”
(“Archibald Constable,” iii. 69.)</p>
<p>It was Smith’s grammar that gave out, and produced no apodosis to his
phrase. Scott could not write himself out, before his brain was affected
by dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>ease. Had his age been miraculously prolonged, with health, it
could never be said that “all the stories have been told,” and he would
have delighted mankind unceasingly.</p>
<p>Scott himself was a little nettled by the criticisms of Norna as a
replica of Meg Merrilies. She is, indeed, “something distinct from the
Dumfriesshire gipsy”—in truth, she rather resembles the Ulrica of
“Ivanhoe.” Like her, she is haunted by the memory of an awful crime, an
insane version of a mere accident; like her, she is a votaress of the
dead gods of the older world, Thor and Odin, and the spirits of the
tempest. Scott’s imagination lived so much in the past that the ancient
creeds never ceased to allure him: like Heine, he felt the fascination
of the banished deities, not of Greece, but of the North. Thus Norna,
crazed by her terrible mischance, dwells among them, worships the Red
Beard, as outlying descendants of the Aztecs yet retain some faith in
their old monstrous Pantheon. Even Minna keeps, in her girlish
enthusiasm, some touch of Freydis in the saga of Eric the Red: for her
the old gods and the old years are not wholly exiled and impotent. All
this is most characteristic of the antiquary and the poet in Scott, who
lingers fondly over what has been, and stirs the last faint embers of
fallen fires. It is of a piece with the harmless Jacobitism of his
festivals, when they sang</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here’s to the King, boys!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye ken wha I mean, boys.</span><br>
</p>
<p>In the singularly feeble and provincial vulgarities which Borrow
launches, in the appendix to “Lavengro,” against the memory of Scott,
the charge of reviving Catholicism is the most bitter. That rowdy
evangelist might as well have charged Scott with a desire to restore the
worship of Odin, and to sacrifice human vic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>tims on the stone altar of
Stennis. He saw in Orkney the ruined fanes of the Norse deities, as at
Melrose of the Virgin, and his loyal heart could feel for all that was
old and lost, for all into which men had put their hearts and faiths,
had made, and had unmade, in the secular quest for the divine. Like a
later poet, he might have said:—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not as their friend or child I speak,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But as on some far Northern strand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinking of his own gods, a Greek</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In pity and mournful awe might stand</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside some fallen Runic stone,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For both were gods, and both are gone.</span><br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">And surely no creed is more savage, cruel, and worthy of death than
Borrow’s belief in a God who “knew where to strike,” and deliberately
struck Scott by inducing Robinson to speculate in hops, and so bring
down his Edinburgh associate, Constable, and with him Sir Walter! Such
was the religion which Borrow expressed in the style of a writer in a
fourth-rate country newspaper. We might prefer the frank Heathenism of
the Red Beard to the religion of the author of “The Bible in Spain.”</p>
<p>There is no denying that Scott had in his imagination a certain mould of
romance, into which his ideas, when he wrote most naturally, and most
for his own pleasure, were apt to run. It is one of the charms of “The
Pirate” that here he is manifestly writing for his own pleasure, with a
certain boyish eagerness. Had we but the plot of one of the tales which
he told, as a lad, to his friend Irving, we might find that it turned on
a romantic mystery, a clue in the hands of some witch or wise woman, of
some one who was always appearing in the nick of time, was always round
the corner when anything was to be heard. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> standing
characteristic of the tales: now it is Edie Ochiltree, now
Flibbertigibbet, now Meg Merrilies, now Norna, who holds the thread of
the plot, but these characters are all well differentiated. Again, he
had types, especially the pedantic type, which attracted him, but they
vary as much as Yellowley and Dugald Dalgetty, the Antiquary, and
Dominie Sampson. Yellowley is rather more repressed than some of Scott’s
bores; but then he is not the only bore, for Claud Halcro, with all his
merits, is a professed proser. Swift had exactly described the
character, the episodical narrator, in a passage parallel to one in
Theophrastus. In writing to Morritt, Scott says (November 1818): “I
sympathise with you for the <i>dole</i> you are <i>dreeing</i> under the
inflictions of your honest proser. Of all the boring machines ever
devised, your regular and determined story-teller is the most peremptory
and powerful in his operations.”</p>
<p>“With what perfect placidity he submitted to be bored even by bores of
the first water!” says Lockhart. The species is one which we all have
many opportunities of studying, but it may be admitted that Scott
produced his studies of bores with a certain complacency. Yet they are
all different bores, and the gay, kind <i>scald</i> Halcro is very unlike
Master Mumblasen or Dominie Sampson.</p>
<p>For a hero Mordaunt may be called almost sprightly and individual. His
mysterious father occasionally suggests the influence of Byron,
occasionally of Mrs. Radcliffe. The Udaller is as individual and genial
as Dandie Dinmont himself; or, again, he is the Cedric of Thule, though
much more sympathetic than Cedric to most readers. His affection for his
daughters is characteristic and deserved. Many a pair of sisters, blonde
and brune, have we met in fiction since Minna and Brenda, but none have
been their peers, and, like Mor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>daunt in early years, we know not to
which of them our hearts are given. They are “L’Allegro” and “Il
Penseroso” of the North, and it is probable that all men would fall in
love with Minna if they had the chance, and marry Brenda, if they could.
Minna is, indeed, the ideal youth of poetry, and Brenda of the practical
life. The innocent illusions of Minna, her love of all that is old, her
championship of the forlorn cause, her beauty, her tenderness, her
truth, her passionate waywardness of sorrow, make her one of Scott’s
most original and delightful heroines. She believes and trembles not,
like Bertram in “Rokeby.” Brenda trembles, but does not believe in
Norna’s magic, and in the spirits of ancient saga. As for Cleveland,
Scott managed to avoid Byron’s Lara-like pirates, and produced a
freebooter as sympathetic as any <i>hostis humani generis</i> can be, while
“Frederick Altamont” (Thackeray borrowed the name for his romantic
crossing-sweeper) has a place among the Marischals and Bucklaws of
romance. Scott’s minute studies in Dryden come to the aid of his local
observations, and so, out of not very promising materials, and out of
the contrast of Lowland Scot and Orcadian, the romance is spun. Probably
the “psychological analysis” which most interested the author is the
double consciousness of Norna, the occasional intrusions of the rational
self on her dreams of supernatural powers. That double consciousness,
indeed, exists in all of us: occasionally the self in which we believe
has a vision of the real underlying self, and shudders from the sight,
like the pair “who met themselves” in the celebrated drawing.</p>
<p>“The Pirate” can scarcely be placed in the front rank of Scott’s novels,
but it has a high and peculiar place in the second, and probably will
always be among the special favourites of those who, being young, are
fortunate enough not to be critical.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>
<p>Scott’s novels at this time came forth so frequently that the lumbering
“Quarterlies” toiled after them in vain. They adopted the plan of
reviewing them in batches, and the “Quarterly” may be said to have
omitted “The Pirate” altogether. About this time Gifford began to find
that the person who spoke of a “dark dialect of Anglified Erse” was not
a competent critic, and Mr. Senior noticed several of the tales in a
more judicious manner. As to “The Pirate,” the “Edinburgh Review”
found “the character and story of Mertoun at once commonplace and
extravagant.” Cleveland disappoints “by turning out so much better
than we had expected, and yet substantially so ill.” “Nothing can
be more beautiful than the description of the sisters.” “Norna is
a new incarnation of Meg Merrilies, and palpably the same in the
spirit ... but far above the rank of a mere imitated or borrowed
character.” “The work, on the whole, opens up a new world to our
curiosity, and affords another proof of the extreme pliability,
as well as vigour, of the author’s genius.”</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<br><br>
<span class="ft60">TO</span><br><br>
THE PIRATE.</h2>
<p class="center">“Quoth he, there was a ship.”</p>
<p>This brief preface may begin like the tale of the Ancient Mariner, since
it was on shipboard that the author acquired the very moderate degree of
local knowledge and information, both of people and scenery, which he
has endeavoured to embody in the romance of the Pirate.</p>
<p>In the summer and autumn of 1814, the author was invited to join a party
of Commissioners for the Northern Light-House Service, who proposed
making a voyage round the coast of Scotland, and through its various
groups of islands, chiefly for the purpose of seeing the condition of
the many lighthouses under their direction,—edifices so important,
whether regarding them as benevolent or political institutions. Among
the commissioners who manage this important public concern, the sheriff
of each county of Scotland which borders on the sea, holds ex-officio a
place at the Board. These gentlemen act in every respect gratuitously,
but have the use of an armed yacht, well found and fitted up, when they
choose to visit the lighthouses. An excellent engineer, Mr. Robert
Stevenson, is attached to the Board, to afford the benefit of his
professional advice. The author accompanied this expedition as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> guest;
for Selkirkshire, though it calls him Sheriff, has not, like the kingdom
of Bohemia in Corporal Trim’s story, a seaport in its circuit, nor its
magistrate, of course, any place at the Board of Commissioners,—a
circumstance of little consequence where all were old and intimate
friends, bred to the same profession, and disposed to accommodate each
other in every possible manner.</p>
<p>The nature of the important business which was the principal purpose of
the voyage, was connected with the amusement of visiting the leading
objects of a traveller’s curiosity; for the wild cape, or formidable
shelve, which requires to be marked out by a lighthouse, is generally at
no great distance from the most magnificent scenery of rocks, caves, and
billows. Our time, too, was at our own disposal, and, as most of us were
freshwater sailors, we could at any time make a fair wind out of a foul
one, and run before the gale in quest of some object of curiosity which
lay under our lee.</p>
<p>With these purposes of public utility and some personal amusement in
view, we left the port of Leith on the 26th July, 1814, ran along the
east coast of Scotland, viewing its different curiosities, stood over to
Zetland and Orkney, where we were some time detained by the wonders of a
country which displayed so much that was new to us; and having seen what
was curious in the Ultima Thule of the ancients, where the sun hardly
thought it worth while to go to bed, since his rising was at this season
so early, we doubled the extreme northern termination of Scotland, and
took a rapid survey of the Hebrides, where we found many kind friends.
There, that our little expedition might not want the dignity of danger,
we were favoured with a distant glimpse of what was said to be an
American cruiser, and had opportunity to consider what a pretty figure
we should have made had the voyage ended in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> our being carried captive
to the United States. After visiting the romantic shores of Morven, and
the vicinity of Oban, we made a run to the coast of Ireland, and visited
the Giant’s Causeway, that we might compare it with Staffa, which we had
surveyed in our course. At length, about the middle of September, we
ended our voyage in the Clyde, at the port of Greenock.</p>
<p>And thus terminated our pleasant tour, to which our equipment gave
unusual facilities, as the ship’s company could form a strong boat’s
crew, independent of those who might be left on board the vessel, which
permitted us the freedom to land wherever our curiosity carried us. Let
me add, while reviewing for a moment a sunny portion of my life, that
among the six or seven friends who performed this voyage together, some
of them doubtless of different tastes and pursuits, and remaining for
several weeks on board a small vessel, there never occurred the
slightest dispute or disagreement, each seeming anxious to submit his
own particular wishes to those of his friends. By this mutual
accommodation all the purposes of our little expedition were obtained,
while for a time we might have adopted the lines of Allan Cunningham’s
fine sea-song,</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“The world of waters was our home,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And merry men were we!”</span><br>
</p>
<p>But sorrow mixes her memorials with the purest remembrances of pleasure.
On returning from the voyage which had proved so satisfactory, I found
that fate had deprived her country most unexpectedly of a lady,
qualified to adorn the high rank which she held, and who had long
admitted me to a share of her friendship. The subsequent loss of one of
those comrades who made up the party, and he the most intimate friend I
had in the world, casts also its shade on recollections which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> but for
these embitterments, would be otherwise so pleasing.</p>
<p>I may here briefly observe, that my business in this voyage, so far as I
could be said to have any, was to endeavour to discover some localities
which might be useful in the “Lord of the Isles,” a poem with which I
was then threatening the public, and was afterwards printed without
attaining remarkable success. But as at the same time the anonymous
novel of “Waverley” was making its way to popularity, I already augured
the possibility of a second effort in this department of literature, and
I saw much in the wild islands of the Orkneys and Zetland, which I
judged might be made in the highest degree interesting, should these
isles ever become the scene of a narrative of fictitious events. I
learned the history of Gow the pirate from an old sibyl, (the subject of
a note, p. 326 of this volume,) whose principal subsistence was by a
trade in favourable winds, which she sold to mariners at Stromness.
Nothing could be more interesting than the kindness and hospitality of
the gentlemen of Zetland, which was to me the more affecting, as several
of them had been friends and correspondents of my father.</p>
<p>I was induced to go a generation or two farther back, to find materials
from which I might trace the features of the old Norwegian Udaller, the
Scottish gentry having in general occupied the place of that primitive
race, and their language and peculiarities of manner having entirely
disappeared. The only difference now to be observed betwixt the gentry
of these islands, and those of Scotland in general, is, that the wealth
and property is more equally divided among our more northern countrymen,
and that there exists among the resident proprietors no men of very
great wealth, whose display of its luxuries might render the others
discontented with their own lot. From the same cause of general
equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>ity of fortunes, and the cheapness of living, which is its natural
consequence, I found the officers of a veteran regiment who had
maintained the garrison at Fort Charlotte, in Lerwick, discomposed at
the idea of being recalled from a country where their pay, however
inadequate to the expenses of a capital, was fully adequate to their
wants, and it was singular to hear natives of merry England herself
regretting their approaching departure from the melancholy isles of the
Ultima Thule.</p>
<p>Such are the trivial particulars attending the origin of that
publication, which took place several years later than the agreeable
journey from which it took its rise.</p>
<p>The state of manners which I have introduced in the romance, was
necessarily in a great degree imaginary, though founded in some measure
on slight hints, which, showing what was, seemed to give reasonable
indication of what must once have been, the tone of the society in these
sequestered but interesting islands.</p>
<p>In one respect I was judged somewhat hastily, perhaps, when the
character of Norna was pronounced by the critics a mere copy of Meg
Merrilees. That I had fallen short of what I wished and desired to
express is unquestionable, otherwise my object could not have been so
widely mistaken; nor can I yet think that any person who will take the
trouble of reading the Pirate with some attention, can fail to trace in
Norna,—the victim of remorse and insanity, and the dupe of her own
imposture, her mind, too, flooded with all the wild literature and
extravagant superstitions of the north,—something distinct from the
Dumfries-shire gipsy, whose pretensions to supernatural powers are not
beyond those of a Norwood prophetess. The foundations of such a
character may be perhaps traced, though it be too true that the
necessary superstructure cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> have been raised upon them, otherwise
these remarks would have been unnecessary. There is also great
improbability in the statement of Norna’s possessing power and
opportunity to impress on others that belief in her supernatural gifts
which distracted her own mind. Yet, amid a very credulous and ignorant
population, it is astonishing what success may be attained by an
impostor, who is, at the same time, an enthusiast. It is such as to
remind us of the couplet which assures us that</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“The pleasure is as great</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In being cheated as to cheat.”</span><br>
</p>
<p>Indeed, as I have observed elsewhere, the professed explanation of a
tale, where appearances or incidents of a supernatural character are
referred to natural causes, has often, in the winding up of the story, a
degree of improbability almost equal to an absolute goblin narrative.
Even the genius of Mrs. Radcliffe could not always surmount this
difficulty.</p>

<h2><a id="ADVERTISEMENT"></a>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p>The purpose of the following Narrative is to give a detailed and
accurate account of certain remarkable incidents which took place in the
Orkney Islands, concerning which the more imperfect traditions and
mutilated records of the country only tell us the following erroneous
particulars:—</p>
<p>In the month of January, 1724-5, a vessel, called the Revenge, bearing
twenty large guns, and six smaller, commanded by <span class="smcap">John Gow</span>, or <span class="smcap">Goffe</span>, or <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, came
to the Orkney Islands, and was discovered to be a pirate, by
various acts of insolence and villainy committed by the crew. These were
for some time submitted to, the inhabitants of these remote islands not
possessing arms nor means of resistance; and so bold was the Captain of
these banditti, that he not only came ashore, and gave dancing parties
in the village of Stromness, but before his real character was
discovered, engaged the affections, and received the troth-plight, of a
young lady possessed of some property. A patriotic individual, <span class="smcap">James Fea</span>, younger of Clestron, formed the plan of securing the buccanier,
which he effected by a mixture of courage and address, in consequence
chiefly of Gow’s vessel having gone on shore near the harbour of
Calfsound, on the Island of Eda, not far distant from a house then
inhabited by Mr. <span class="smcap">Fea</span>. In the various stratagems by which Mr. <span class="smcap">Fea</span>
contrived finally, at the peril of his life, (they being well armed and
desperate,) to make the whole pirates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> his prisoners, he was much aided
by Mr. <span class="smcap">James Laing</span>, the grandfather of the late <span class="smcap">Malcolm Laing</span>, Esq., the
acute and ingenious historian of Scotland during the 17th century.</p>
<p>Gow, and others of his crew, suffered, by sentence of the High Court of
Admiralty, the punishment their crimes had long deserved. He conducted
himself with great audacity when before the Court; and, from an account
of the matter by an eye-witness, seems to have been subjected to some
unusual severities, in order to compel him to plead. The words are
these: “<span class="smcap">John
Gow</span> would not plead, for which he was brought to the bar,
and the Judge ordered that his thumbs should be squeezed by two men,
with a whip-cord, till it did break; and then it should be doubled, till
it did again break, and then laid threefold, and that the executioners
should pull with their whole strength; which sentence Gow endured with a
great deal of boldness.” The next morning, (27th May, 1725,) when he had
seen the terrible preparations for pressing him to death, his courage
gave way, and he told the Marshal of Court, that he would not have given
so much trouble, had he been assured of not being hanged in chains. He
was then tried, condemned, and executed, with others of his crew.</p>
<p>It is said, that the lady whose affections <span class="smcap">Gow</span> had engaged, went up to
London to see him before his death, and that, arriving too late, she had
the courage to request a sight of his dead body; and then, touching the
hand of the corpse, she formally resumed the troth-plight which she had
bestowed. Without going through this ceremony, she could not, according

of her departed lover, in the event of her bestowing upon any living
suitor the faith which she had plighted to the dead. This part of the
legend may serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> curious commentary on the fine Scottish ballad,
which begins,</p>

<p>The common account of this incident farther bears, that Mr. <span class="smcap">Fea</span>, the
spirited individual by whose exertions <span class="smcap">Gow’s</span> career of iniquity was cut
short, was so far from receiving any reward from Government, that he
could not obtain even countenance enough to protect him against a
variety of sham suits, raised against him by Newgate solicitors, who
acted in the name of <span class="smcap">Gow</span>, and others of the pirate crew; and the various
expenses, vexatious prosecutions, and other legal consequences, in which
his gallant exploit involved him, utterly ruined his fortune, and his
family; making his memory a notable example to all who shall in future
take pirates on their own authority.</p>
<p>It is to be supposed, for the honour of <span class="smcap">George</span> the First’s Government,
that the last circumstance, as well as the dates, and other particulars
of the commonly received story, are inaccurate, since they will be found
totally irreconcilable with the following veracious narrative, compiled

</p>
<p>That long, narrow, and irregular island, usually called the mainland of
Zetland, because it is by far the largest of that Archipelago,
terminates, as is well known to the mariners who navigate the stormy
seas which surround the Thule of the ancients, in a cliff of immense
height, entitled Sumburgh-Head, which presents its bare scalp and naked
sides to the weight of a tremendous surge, forming the extreme point of
the isle to the south-east. This lofty promontory is constantly exposed
to the current of a strong and furious tide, which, setting in betwixt
the Orkney and Zetland Islands, and running with force only inferior to
that of the Pentland Frith, takes its name from the headland we have
mentioned, and is called the Roost of Sumburgh; <i>roost</i> being the phrase
assigned in those isles to currents of this description.</p>
<p>On the land side, the promontory is covered with short grass, and slopes
steeply down to a little isthmus, upon which the sea has encroached in
creeks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> which, advancing from either side of the island, gradually work
their way forward, and seem as if in a short time they would form a
junction, and altogether insulate Sumburgh-Head, when what is now a
cape, will become a lonely mountain islet, severed from the mainland, of
which it is at present the terminating extremity.</p>
<p>Man, however, had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely
event; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or, as other accounts said,
and as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply, an ancient Earl of the
Orkneys had selected this neck of land as the place for establishing a
mansion-house. It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only
can be discerned with difficulty; for the loose sand, borne on the
tempestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost
buried, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth
century, a part of the Earl’s mansion was still entire and habitable. It
was a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the
eye, or to excite the imagination; a large old-fashioned narrow house,
with a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of grey sandstone,
would perhaps convey the best idea of the place to a modern reader. The
windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the
building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure
had rested, in former times, certain smaller co-partments of the
mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary
for the accommodation of the Earl’s retainers and menials. But these had
become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood, or
for other purposes; the walls had given way in many places;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> and, to
complete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the
ruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers they contained, to
the depth of two or three feet.</p>
<p>Amid this desolation, the inhabitants of Jarlshof had contrived, by
constant labour and attention, to keep in order a few roods of land,
which had been enclosed as a garden, and which, sheltered by the walls
of the house itself, from the relentless sea-blast, produced such
vegetables as the climate could bring forth, or rather as the sea-gale
would permit to grow; for these islands experience even less of the
rigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of Scotland; but,
unsheltered by a wall of some sort or other, it is scarce possible to
raise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables; and as for shrubs or
trees, they are entirely out of the question, such is the force of the
sweeping sea-blast.</p>
<p>At a short distance from the mansion, and near to the sea-beach, just
where the creek forms a sort of imperfect harbour, in which lay three or
four fishing-boats, there were a few most wretched cottages for the
inhabitants and tenants of the township of Jarlshof, who held the whole
district of the landlord upon such terms as were in those days usually
granted to persons of this description, and which, of course, were hard
enough. The landlord himself resided upon an estate which he possessed
in a more eligible situation, in a different part of the island, and
seldom visited his possessions at Sumburgh-Head. He was an honest, plain
Zetland gentleman, somewhat passionate, the necessary result of being
surrounded by dependents; and somewhat over-convivial in his habits, the
consequence, per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>haps, of having too much time at his disposal; but
frank-tempered and generous to his people, and kind and hospitable to
strangers. He was descended also of an old and noble Norwegian family; a
circumstance which rendered him dearer to the lower orders, most of whom
are of the same race; while the lairds, or proprietors, are generally of
Scottish extraction, who, at that early period, were still considered as
strangers and intruders. Magnus Troil, who deduced his descent from the
very Earl who was supposed to have founded Jarlshof, was peculiarly of
this opinion.</p>
<p>The present inhabitants of Jarlshof had experienced, on several
occasions, the kindness and good will of the proprietor of the
territory. When Mr. Mertoun—such was the name of the present inhabitant
of the old mansion—first arrived in Zetland, some years before the
story commences, he had been received at the house of Mr. Troil with
that warm and cordial hospitality for which the islands are
distinguished. No one asked him whence he came, where he was going, what
was his purpose in visiting so remote a corner of the empire, or what
was likely to be the term of his stay. He arrived a perfect stranger,
yet was instantly overpowered by a succession of invitations; and in
each house which he visited, he found a home as long as he chose to
accept it, and lived as one of the family, unnoticed and unnoticing,
until he thought proper to remove to some other dwelling. This apparent
indifference to the rank, character, and qualities of their guest, did
not arise from apathy on the part of his kind hosts, for the islanders
had their full share of natural curiosity; but their delicacy deemed it
would be an infringement upon the laws of hospi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>tality, to ask questions
which their guest might have found it difficult or unpleasing to answer;
and instead of endeavouring, as is usual in other countries, to wring
out of Mr. Mertoun such communications as he might find it agreeable to
withhold, the considerate Zetlanders contented themselves with eagerly
gathering up such scraps of information as could be collected in the
course of conversation.</p>
<p>But the rock in an Arabian desert is not more reluctant to afford water,
than Mr. Basil Mertoun was niggard in imparting his confidence, even
incidentally; and certainly the politeness of the gentry of Thule was
never put to a more severe test than when they felt that good-breeding
enjoined them to abstain from enquiring into the situation of so
mysterious a personage.</p>
<p>All that was actually known of him was easily summed up. Mr. Mertoun had
come to Lerwick, then rising into some importance, but not yet
acknowledged as the principal town of the island, in a Dutch vessel,
accompanied only by his son, a handsome boy of about fourteen years old.
His own age might exceed forty. The Dutch skipper introduced him to some
of the very good friends with whom he used to barter gin and gingerbread
for little Zetland bullocks, smoked geese, and stockings of lambs-wool;
and although Meinheer could only say, that “Meinheer Mertoun hab bay his
bassage like one gentlemans, and hab given a Kreitz-dollar beside to the
crew,” this introduction served to establish the Dutchman’s passenger in
a respectable circle of acquaintances, which gradually enlarged, as it
appeared that the stranger was a man of considerable acquirements.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>This discovery was made almost <i>per force</i>; for Mertoun was as unwilling
to speak upon general subjects, as upon his own affairs. But he was
sometimes led into discussions, which showed, as it were in spite of
himself, the scholar and the man of the world; and, at other times, as
if in requital of the hospitality which he experienced, he seemed to
compel himself, against his fixed nature, to enter into the society of
those around him, especially when it assumed the grave, melancholy, or
satirical cast, which best suited the temper of his own mind. Upon such
occasions, the Zetlanders were universally of opinion that he must have
had an excellent education, neglected only in one striking particular,
namely, that Mr. Mertoun scarce knew the stem of a ship from the stern;
and in the management of a boat, a cow could not be more ignorant. It
seemed astonishing such gross ignorance of the most necessary art of
life (in the Zetland Isles at least) should subsist along with his
accomplishments in other respects; but so it was.</p>
<p>Unless called forth in the manner we have mentioned, the habits of Basil
Mertoun were retired and gloomy. From loud mirth he instantly fled; and
even the moderated cheerfulness of a friendly party, had the invariable
effect of throwing him into deeper dejection than even his usual
demeanour indicated.</p>
<p>Women are always particularly desirous of investigating mystery, and of
alleviating melancholy, especially when these circumstances are united
in a handsome man about the prime of life. It is possible, therefore,
that amongst the fair-haired and blue-eyed daughters of Thule, this
mysterious and pensive stranger might have found some one to take upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
herself the task of consolation, had he shown any willingness to accept
such kindly offices; but, far from doing so, he seemed even to shun the
presence of the sex, to which in our distresses, whether of mind or
body, we generally apply for pity and comfort.</p>
<p>To these peculiarities Mr. Mertoun added another, which was particularly
disagreeable to his host and principal patron, Magnus Troil. This
magnate of Zetland, descended by the father’s side, as we have already
said, from an ancient Norwegian family, by the marriage of its
representative with a Danish lady, held the devout opinion that a cup of
Geneva or Nantz was specific against all cares and afflictions whatever.
These were remedies to which Mr. Mertoun never applied; his drink was
water, and water alone, and no persuasion or entreaties could induce him
to taste any stronger beverage than was afforded by the pure spring. Now
this Magnus Troil could not tolerate; it was a defiance to the ancient
northern laws of conviviality, which, for his own part, he had so
rigidly observed, that although he was wont to assert that he had never
in his life gone to bed drunk, (that is, in his own sense of the word,)
it would have been impossible to prove that he had ever resigned himself
to slumber in a state of actual and absolute sobriety. It may be
therefore asked, What did this stranger bring into society to compensate
the displeasure given by his austere and abstemious habits? He had, in
the first place, that manner and self-importance which mark a person of
some consequence: and although it was conjectured that he could not be
rich, yet it was certainly known by his expenditure that neither was he
absolutely poor. He had, besides, some powers of con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>versation, when, as
we have already hinted, he chose to exert them, and his misanthropy or
aversion to the business and intercourse of ordinary life, was often
expressed in an antithetical manner, which passed for wit, when better
was not to be had. Above all, Mr. Mertoun’s secret seemed impenetrable,
and his presence had all the interest of a riddle, which men love to
read over and over, because they cannot find out the meaning of it.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these recommendations, Mertoun differed in so many
material points from his host, that after he had been for some time a
guest at his principal residence, Magnus Troil was agreeably surprised
when, one evening after they had sat two hours in absolute silence,
drinking brandy and water,—that is, Magnus drinking the alcohol, and
Mertoun the element,—the guest asked his host’s permission to occupy,
as his tenant, this deserted mansion of Jarlshof, at the extremity of
the territory called Dunrossness, and situated just beneath
Sumburgh-Head. “I shall be handsomely rid of him,” quoth Magnus to
himself, “and his kill-joy visage will never again stop the bottle in
its round. His departure will ruin me in lemons, however, for his mere
look was quite sufficient to sour a whole ocean of punch.”</p>
<p>Yet the kind-hearted Zetlander generously and disinterestedly
remonstrated with Mr. Mertoun on the solitude and inconveniences to
which he was about to subject himself. “There were scarcely,” he said,
“even the most necessary articles of furniture in the old house—there
was no society within many miles—for provisions, the principal article
of food would be sour sillocks, and his only company gulls and
gannets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“My good friend,” replied Mertoun, “if you could have named a
circumstance which would render the residence more eligible to me than
any other, it is that there would be neither human luxury nor human
society near the place of my retreat; a shelter from the weather for my
own head, and for the boy’s, is all I seek for. So name your rent, Mr.
Troil, and let me be your tenant at Jarlshof.”</p>
<p>“Rent?” answered the Zetlander; “why, no great rent for an old house
which no one has lived in since my mother’s time—God rest her!—and as
for shelter, the old walls are thick enough, and will bear many a bang
yet. But, Heaven love you, Mr. Mertoun, think what you are purposing.
For one of us to live at Jarlshof, were a wild scheme enough; but you,
who are from another country, whether English, Scotch, or Irish, no one
can tell”——</p>
<p>“Nor does it greatly matter,” said Mertoun, somewhat abruptly.</p>
<p>“Not a herring’s scale,” answered the Laird; “only that I like you the
better for being no Scot, as I trust you are not one. Hither they have
come like the clack-geese—every chamberlain has brought over a flock of
his own name, and his own hatching, for what I know, and here they roost
for ever—catch them returning to their own barren Highlands or
Lowlands, when once they have tasted our Zetland beef, and seen our
bonny <i>voes</i> and lochs. No, sir,” (here Magnus proceeded with great
animation, sipping from time to time the half-diluted spirit, which at
the same time animated his resentment against the intruders, and enabled
him to endure the mortifying reflection which it suggested,)—“No, sir,
the ancient days and the genuine manners of these Islands are no more;
for our ancient possessors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>—our Patersons, our Feas, our
Schlagbrenners, our Thorbiorns, have given place to Giffords, Scotts,
Mouats, men whose names bespeak them or their ancestors strangers to the
soil which we the Troils have inhabited long before the days of
Turf-Einar, who first taught these Isles the mystery of burning peat for
fuel, and who has been handed down to a grateful posterity by a name
which records the discovery.”</p>
<p>This was a subject upon which the potentate of Jarlshof was usually very
diffuse, and Mertoun saw him enter upon it with pleasure, because he
knew he should not be called upon to contribute any aid to the
conversation, and might therefore indulge his own saturnine humour while
the Norwegian Zetlander declaimed on the change of times and
inhabitants. But just as Magnus had arrived at the melancholy
conclusion, “how probable it was, that in another century scarce a
<i>merk</i>—scarce even an <i>ure</i> of land, would be in the possession of the
Norse inhabitants, the true Udallers<a id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_8">[7]</a> of Zetland,” he recollected the
circumstances of his guest, and stopped suddenly short. “I do not say
all this,” he added, interrupting himself, “as if I were unwilling that
you should settle on my estate, Mr. Mertoun—But for Jarlshof—the place
is a wild one—Come from where you will, I warrant you will say, like
other travellers, you came from a better climate than ours, for so say
you all. And yet you think of a retreat, which the very natives run away
from. Will you not take your glass?”—(This was to be considered as
interjectional,)—“then here’s to you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“My good sir,” answered Mertoun, “I am indifferent to climate; if there
is but air enough to fill my lungs, I care not if it be the breath of
Arabia or of Lapland.”</p>
<p>“Air enough you may have,” answered Magnus, “no lack of that—somewhat
damp, strangers allege it to be, but we know a corrective for
that—Here’s to you, Mr. Mertoun—You must learn to <i>do so</i>, and to
smoke a pipe; and then, as you say, you will find the air of Zetland
equal to that of Arabia. But have you seen Jarlshof?”</p>
<p>The stranger intimated that he had not.</p>
<p>“Then,” replied Magnus, “you have no idea of your undertaking. If you
think it a comfortable roadstead like this, with the house situated on
the side of an inland voe,<a id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_9">[8]</a> that brings the herrings up to your door,
you are mistaken, my heart. At Jarlshof you will see nought but the wild
waves tumbling on the bare rocks, and the Roost of Sumburgh running at
the rate of fifteen knots an-hour.”</p>
<p>“I shall see nothing at least of the current of human passions,” replied
Mertoun.</p>
<p>“You will hear nothing but the clanging and screaming of scarts,
sheer-waters, and seagulls, from daybreak till sunset.”</p>
<p>“I will compound, my friend,” replied the stranger, “so that I do not
hear the chattering of women’s tongues.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the Norman, “that is because you hear just now my little
Minna and Brenda singing in the garden with your Mordaunt. Now, I would
rather listen to their little voices, than the skylark which I once
heard in Caithness, or the nightingale that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> have read of.—What will
the girls do for want of their playmate Mordaunt?”</p>
<p>“They will shift for themselves,” answered Mertoun; “younger or elder
they will find playmates or dupes.—But the question is, Mr. Troil, will
you let to me, as your tenant, this old mansion of Jarlshof?”</p>
<p>“Gladly, since you make it your option to live in a spot so desolate.”</p>
<p>“And as for the rent?” continued Mertoun.</p>
<p>“The rent?” replied Magnus; “hum—why, you must have the bit of <i>plantie
cruive</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_10">[9]</a> which they once called a garden, and a right in the
<i>scathold</i>, and a sixpenny merk of land, that the tenants may fish for
you;—eight <i>lispunds</i><a id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_11">[10]</a> of butter, and eight shillings sterling
yearly, is not too much?”</p>
<p>Mr. Mertoun agreed to terms so moderate, and from thenceforward resided
chiefly at the solitary mansion which we have described in the beginning
of this chapter, conforming not only without complaint, but, as it
seemed, with a sullen pleasure, to all the privations which so wild and
desolate a situation necessarily imposed on its inhabitant.</p>

</p>
<p>The few inhabitants of the township of Jarlshof had at first heard with
alarm, that a person of rank superior to their own was come to reside in
the ruinous tenement, which they still called the Castle. In those days
(for the present times are greatly altered for the better) the presence
of a superior, in such a situation, was almost certain to be attended
with additional burdens and exactions, for which, under one pretext or
another, feudal customs furnished a thousand apologies. By each of
these, a part of the tenants’ hard-won and precarious profits was
diverted for the use of their powerful neighbour and superior, the
tacksman, as he was called. But the sub-tenants speedily found that no
oppression of this kind was to be apprehended at the hands of Basil
Mertoun. His own means, whether large or small, were at least fully
adequate to his expenses, which, so far as regarded his habits of life,
were of the most frugal description. The luxuries of a few books, and
some philosophical instruments, with which he was supplied from London
as occasion offered, seemed to indicate a degree of wealth unusual in
those islands; but, on the other hand, the table and the accommodations
at Jarlshof, did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> exceed what was maintained by a Zetland proprietor
of the most inferior description.</p>
<p>The tenants of the hamlet troubled themselves very little about the
quality of their superior, as soon as they found that their situation
was rather to be mended than rendered worse by his presence; and, once
relieved from the apprehension of his tyrannizing over them, they laid
their heads together to make the most of him by various petty tricks of
overcharge and extortion, which for a while the stranger submitted to
with the most philosophic indifference. An incident, however, occurred,
which put his character in a new light, and effectually checked all
future efforts at extravagant imposition.</p>
<p>A dispute arose in the kitchen of the Castle betwixt an old governante,
who acted as housekeeper to Mr. Mertoun, and Sweyn Erickson, as good a
Zetlander as ever rowed a boat to the <i>haaf</i> fishing;<a id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_12">[11]</a> which dispute,
as is usual in such cases, was maintained with such increasing heat and
vociferation as to reach the ears of the master, (as he was called,)
who, secluded in a solitary turret, was deeply employed in examining the
contents of a new package of books from London, which, after long
expectation, had found its way to Hull, from thence by a whaling vessel
to Lerwick, and so to Jarlshof. With more than the usual thrill of
indignation which indolent people always feel when roused into action on
some unpleasant occasion, Mertoun descended to the scene of contest, and
so suddenly, peremptorily, and strictly, enquired into the cause of
dispute, that the parties, notwithstanding every evasion which they
attempted, became unable to disguise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> from him, that their difference
respected the several interests to which the honest governante, and no
less honest fisherman, were respectively entitled, in an overcharge of
about one hundred per cent on a bargain of rock-cod, purchased by the
former from the latter, for the use of the family at Jarlshof.</p>
<p>When this was fairly ascertained and confessed, Mr. Mertoun stood
looking upon the culprits with eyes in which the utmost scorn seemed to
contend with awakening passion. “Hark you, ye old hag,” said he at
length to the housekeeper, “avoid my house this instant! and know that I
dismiss you, not for being a liar, a thief, and an ungrateful
quean,—for these are qualities as proper to you as your name of
woman,—but for daring, in my house, to scold above your breath.—And
for you, you rascal, who suppose you may cheat a stranger as you would
<i>flinch</i><a id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_13">[12]</a> a whale, know that I am well acquainted with the rights
which, by delegation from your master, Magnus Troil, I can exercise over
you, if I will. Provoke me to a certain pitch, and you shall learn, to
your cost, I can break your rest as easily as you can interrupt my
leisure. I know the meaning of <i>scat</i>, and <i>wattle</i>, and <i>hawkhen</i>, and
<i>hagalef</i>,<a id="FNanchor_B_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_B_14">(<i>b</i>)</a> and every other exaction, by which your lords, in
ancient and modern days, have wrung your withers; nor is there one of
you that shall not rue the day that you could not be content with
robbing me of my money, but must also break in on my leisure with your
atrocious northern clamour, that rivals in discord the screaming of a
flight of Arctic gulls.”</p>
<p>Nothing better occurred to Sweyn, in answer to this objurgation, than
the preferring a humble re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>quest that his honour would be pleased to
keep the cod-fish without payment, and say no more about the matter; but
by this time Mr. Mertoun had worked up his passions into an ungovernable
rage, and with one hand he threw the money at the fisherman’s head,
while with the other he pelted him out of the apartment with his own
fish, which he finally flung out of doors after him.</p>
<p>There was so much of appalling and tyrannic fury in the stranger’s
manner on this occasion, that Sweyn neither stopped to collect the money
nor take back his commodity, but fled at a precipitate rate to the small
hamlet, to tell his comrades that if they provoked Master Mertoun any
farther, he would turn an absolute Pate Stewart<a id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_15">[13]</a> on their hand, and
head and hang without either judgment or mercy.</p>
<p>Hither also came the discarded housekeeper, to consult with her
neighbours and kindred (for she too was a native of the village) what
she should do to regain the desirable situation from which she had been
so suddenly expelled. The old Ranzellaar of the village, who had the
voice most potential in the deliberations of the township, after hearing
what had happened, pronounced that Sweyn Erickson had gone too far in
raising the market upon Mr. Mertoun; and that whatever pretext the
tacksman might assume for thus giving way to his anger, the real
grievance must have been the charging the rock cod-fish at a penny
instead of a half-penny a-pound; he therefore exhorted all the community
never to raise their exactions in future beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> proportion of
threepence upon the shilling, at which rate their master at the Castle
could not reasonably be expected to grumble, since, as he was disposed
to do them no harm, it was reasonable to think that, in a moderate way,
he had no objection to do them good. “And three upon twelve,” said the
experienced Ranzellaar, “is a decent and moderate profit, and will bring
with it God’s blessing and Saint Ronald’s.”</p>
<p>Proceeding upon the tariff thus judiciously recommended to them, the
inhabitants of Jarlshof cheated Mertoun in future only to the moderate
extent of twenty-five per cent; a rate to which all nabobs,
army-contractors, speculators in the funds, and others, whom recent and
rapid success has enabled to settle in the country upon a great scale,
ought to submit, as very reasonable treatment at the hand of their
rustic neighbours. Mertoun at least seemed of that opinion, for he gave
himself no farther trouble upon the subject of his household expenses.</p>
<p>The conscript fathers of Jarlshof, having settled their own matters,
took next under their consideration the case of Swertha, the banished
matron who had been expelled from the Castle, whom, as an experienced
and useful ally, they were highly desirous to restore to her office of
housekeeper, should that be found possible. But as their wisdom here
failed them, Swertha, in despair, had recourse to the good offices of
Mordaunt Mertoun, with whom she had acquired some favour by her
knowledge in old Norwegian ballads, and dismal tales concerning the
Trows or Drows, (the dwarfs of the Scalds,) with whom superstitious eld
had peopled many a lonely cavern and brown dale in Dunrossness, as in
every other district of Zetland. “Swertha,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> youth, “I can do
but little for you, but you may do something for yourself. My father’s
passion resembles the fury of those ancient champions, those Berserkars,
you sing songs about.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, fish of my heart,” replied the old woman, with a pathetic
whine; “the Berserkars<a id="FNanchor_C_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_C_16">(<i>c</i>)</a> were champions who lived before the blessed
days of Saint Olave, and who used to run like madmen on swords, and
spears, and harpoons, and muskets, and snap them all into pieces, as a
finner<a id="FNanchor_14_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_17">[14]</a> would go through a herring-net, and then, when the fury went
off, they were as weak and unstable as water.”<a id="FNanchor_15_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_18">[15]</a></p>
<p>“That’s the very thing, Swertha,” said Mordaunt. “Now, my father never
likes to think of his passion after it is over, and is so much of a
Berserkar, that, let him be desperate as he will to-day, he will not
care about it to-morrow. Therefore, he has not filled up your place in
the household at the Castle, and not a mouthful of warm food has been
dressed there since you went away, and not a morsel of bread baked, but
we have lived just upon whatever cold thing came to hand. Now, Swertha,
I will be your warrant, that if you go boldly up to the Castle, and
enter upon the discharge of your duties as usual, you will never hear a
single word from him.”</p>
<p>Swertha hesitated at first to obey this bold counsel. She said, “to her
thinking, Mr. Mertoun, when he was angry, looked more like a fiend than
any Berserkar of them all; that the fire flashed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> his eyes, and the
foam flew from his lips; and that it would be a plain tempting of
Providence to put herself again in such a venture.”</p>
<p>But, on the encouragement which she received from the son, she
determined at length once more to face the parent; and, dressing herself
in her ordinary household attire, for so Mordaunt particularly
recommended, she slipped into the Castle, and presently resuming the
various and numerous occupations which devolved on her, seemed as deeply
engaged in household cares as if she had never been out of office.</p>
<p>The first day of her return to her duty, Swertha made no appearance in
presence of her master, but trusted that after his three days’ diet on
cold meat, a hot dish, dressed with the best of her simple skill, might
introduce her favourably to his recollection. When Mordaunt had reported
that his father had taken no notice of this change of diet, and when she
herself observed that in passing and repassing him occasionally, her
appearance produced no effect upon her singular master, she began to
imagine that the whole affair had escaped Mr. Mertoun’s memory, and was
active in her duty as usual. Neither was she convinced of the contrary
until one day, when, happening somewhat to elevate her tone in a dispute
with the other maid-servant, her master, who at that time passed the
place of contest, eyed her with a strong glance, and pronounced the
single word, <i>Remember!</i> in a tone which taught Swertha the government
of her tongue for many weeks after.</p>
<p>If Mertoun was whimsical in his mode of governing his household, he
seemed no less so in his plan of educating his son. He showed the youth
but few symptoms of parental affection; yet, in his ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> state of
mind, the improvement of Mordaunt’s education seemed to be the utmost
object of his life. He had both books and information sufficient to
discharge the task of tutor in the ordinary branches of knowledge; and
in this capacity was regular, calm, and strict, not to say severe, in
exacting from his pupil the attention necessary for his profiting. But
in the perusal of history, to which their attention was frequently
turned, as well as in the study of classic authors, there often occurred
facts or sentiments which produced an instant effect upon Mertoun’s
mind, and brought on him suddenly what Swertha, Sweyn, and even
Mordaunt, came to distinguish by the name of his dark hour. He was
aware, in the usual case, of its approach, and retreated to an inner
apartment, into which he never permitted even Mordaunt to enter. Here he
would abide in seclusion for days, and even weeks, only coming out at
uncertain times, to take such food as they had taken care to leave
within his reach, which he used in wonderfully small quantities. At
other times, and especially during the winter solstice, when almost
every person spends the gloomy time within doors in feasting and
merriment, this unhappy man would wrap himself in a dark-coloured
sea-cloak, and wander out along the stormy beach, or upon the desolate
heath, indulging his own gloomy and wayward reveries under the inclement
sky, the rather that he was then most sure to wander unencountered and
unobserved.</p>
<p>As Mordaunt grew older, he learned to note the particular signs which
preceded these fits of gloomy despondency, and to direct such
precautions as might ensure his unfortunate parent from ill-timed
interruption, (which had always the effect of driving him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> to fury,)
while, at the same time, full provision was made for his subsistence.
Mordaunt perceived that at such periods the melancholy fit of his father
was greatly prolonged, if he chanced to present himself to his eyes
while the dark hour was upon him. Out of respect, therefore, to his
parent, as well as to indulge the love of active exercise and of
amusement natural to his period of life, Mordaunt used often to absent
himself altogether from the mansion of Jarlshof, and even from the
district, secure that his father, if the dark hour passed away in his
absence, would be little inclined to enquire how his son had disposed of
his leisure, so that he was sure he had not watched his own weak
moments; that being the subject on which he entertained the utmost
jealousy.</p>
<p>At such times, therefore, all the sources of amusement which the country
afforded, were open to the younger Mertoun, who, in these intervals of
his education, had an opportunity to give full scope to the energies of
a bold, active, and daring character. He was often engaged with the
youth of the hamlet in those desperate sports, to which the “dreadful
trade of the samphire-gatherer” is like a walk upon level ground—often
joined those midnight excursions upon the face of the giddy cliffs, to
secure the eggs or the young of the sea-fowl; and in these daring
adventures displayed an address, presence of mind, and activity, which,
in one so young, and not a native of the country, astonished the oldest
fowlers.<a id="FNanchor_16_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_19">[16]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>At other times, Mordaunt accompanied Sweyn and other fishermen in their
long and perilous expeditions to the distant and deep sea, learning
under their direction the management of the boat, in which they equal,
or exceed, perhaps, any natives of the British empire. This exercise had
charms for Mordaunt, independently of the fishing alone.</p>
<p>At this time, the old Norwegian sagas were much remembered, and often
rehearsed, by the fishermen, who still preserved among themselves the
ancient Norse tongue, which was the speech of their forefathers. In the
dark romance of those Scandinavian tales, lay much that was captivating
to a youthful ear; and the classic fables of antiquity were rivalled at
least, if not excelled, in Mordaunt’s opinion, by the strange legends of
Berserkars, of Sea-kings, of dwarfs, giants, and sorcerers, which he
heard from the native Zetlanders. Often the scenes around him were
assigned as the localities of the wild poems, which, half recited, half
chanted by voices as hoarse, if not so loud, as the waves over which
they floated, pointed out the very bay on which they sailed as the scene
of a bloody sea-fight; the scarce-seen heap of stones that bristled over
the projecting cape, as the dun, or castle, of some potent earl or noted
pirate; the distant and solitary grey stone on the lonely moor, as
marking the grave of a hero; the wild cavern, up which the sea rolled in
heavy, broad, and unbroken billows, as the dwelling of some noted
sorceress.<a id="FNanchor_17_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_20">[17]</a></p>
<p>The ocean also had its mysteries, the effect of which was aided by the
dim twilight, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> which it was imperfectly seen for more than half
the year. Its bottomless depths and secret caves contained, according to
the account of Sweyn and others, skilled in legendary lore, such wonders
as modern navigators reject with disdain. In the quiet moonlight bay,
where the waves came rippling to the shore, upon a bed of smooth sand
intermingled with shells, the mermaid was still seen to glide along the
waters, and, mingling her voice with the sighing breeze, was often heard
to sing of subterranean wonders, or to chant prophecies of future
events. The kraken, that hugest of living things, was still supposed to
cumber the recesses of the Northern Ocean; and often, when some fog-bank
covered the sea at a distance, the eye of the experienced boatman saw
the horns of the monstrous leviathan welking and waving amidst the
wreaths of mist, and bore away with all press of oar and sail, lest the
sudden suction, occasioned by the sinking of the monstrous mass to the
bottom, should drag within the grasp of its multifarious feelers his own
frail skiff. The sea-snake was also known, which, arising out of the
depths of ocean, stretches to the skies his enormous neck, covered with
a mane like that of a war-horse, and with its broad glittering eyes,
raised mast-head high, looks out, as it seems, for plunder or for
victims.</p>
<p>Many prodigious stories of these marine monsters, and of many others
less known, were then universally received among the Zetlanders, whose
descendants have not as yet by any means abandoned faith in them.<a id="FNanchor_18_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_21">[18]</a></p>
<p>Such legends are, indeed, everywhere current<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> amongst the vulgar; but
the imagination is far more powerfully affected by them on the deep and
dangerous seas of the north, amidst precipices and headlands, many
hundred feet in height,—amid perilous straits, and currents, and
eddies,—long sunken reefs of rock, over which the vivid ocean foams and
boils,—dark caverns, to whose extremities neither man nor skiff has
ever ventured,—lonely, and often uninhabited isles,—and occasionally
the ruins of ancient northern fastnesses, dimly seen by the feeble light
of the Arctic winter. To Mordaunt, who had much of romance in his
disposition, these superstitions formed a pleasing and interesting
exercise of the imagination, while, half doubting, half inclined to
believe, he listened to the tales chanted concerning these wonders of
nature, and creatures of credulous belief, told in the rude but
energetic language of the ancient Scalds.</p>
<p>But there wanted not softer and lighter amusement, that might seem
better suited to Mordaunt’s age, than the wild tales and rude exercises
which we have already mentioned. The season of winter, when, from the
shortness of the daylight, labour becomes impossible, is in Zetland the
time of revel, feasting, and merriment. Whatever the fisherman has been
able to acquire during summer, was expended, and often wasted, in
maintaining the mirth and hospitality of his hearth during this period;
while the landholders and gentlemen of the island gave double loose to
their convivial and hospitable dispositions, thronged their houses with
guests, and drove away the rigour of the season with jest, glee, and
song, the dance, and the wine-cup.</p>
<p>Amid the revels of this merry, though rigorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> season, no youth added
more spirit to the dance, or glee to the revel, than the young stranger,
Mordaunt Mertoun. When his father’s state of mind permitted, or indeed
required, his absence, he wandered from house to house a welcome guest
whereever he came, and lent his willing voice to the song, and his foot
to the dance. A boat, or, if the weather, as was often the case,
permitted not that convenience, one of the numerous ponies, which,
straying in hordes about the extensive moors, may be said to be at any
man’s command who can catch them, conveyed him from the mansion of one
hospitable Zetlander to that of another. None excelled him in performing
the warlike sword-dance, a species of amusement which had been derived
from the habits of the ancient Norsemen. He could play upon the <i>gue</i>,
and upon the common violin, the melancholy and pathetic tunes peculiar
to the country; and with great spirit and execution could relieve their
monotony with the livelier airs of the North of Scotland. When a party
set forth as maskers, or, as they are called in Scotland, <i>guizards</i>, to
visit some neighbouring Laird, or rich Udaller, it augured well of the
expedition if Mordaunt Mertoun could be prevailed upon to undertake the
office of <i>skudler</i>, or leader of the band. Upon these occasions, full
of fun and frolic, he led his retinue from house to house, bringing
mirth where he went, and leaving regret when he departed. Mordaunt
became thus generally known and beloved as generally, through most of
the houses composing the patriarchal community of the Main Isle; but his
visits were most frequently and most willingly paid at the mansion of
his father’s landlord and protector, Magnus Troil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>It was not entirely the hearty and sincere welcome of the worthy old
Magnate, nor the sense that he was in effect his father’s patron, which
occasioned these frequent visits. The hand of welcome was indeed
received as eagerly as it was sincerely given, while the ancient
Udaller, raising himself in his huge chair, whereof the inside was lined
with well-dressed sealskins, and the outside composed of massive oak,
carved by the rude graving-tool of some Hamburgh carpenter, shouted
forth his welcome in a tone, which might, in ancient times, have hailed
the return of <i>Ioul</i>, the highest festival of the Goths. There was metal
yet more attractive, and younger hearts, whose welcome, if less loud,
was as sincere as that of the jolly Udaller. But this is matter which
ought not to be discussed at the conclusion of a chapter.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Scots Song.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>We have already mentioned Minna and Brenda, the daughters of Magnus
Troil. Their mother had been dead for many years, and they were now two
beautiful girls, the eldest only eighteen, which might be a year or two
younger than Mordaunt Mertoun, the second about seventeen.—They were
the joy of their father’s heart, and the light of his old eyes; and
although indulged to a degree which might have endangered his comfort
and their own, they repaid his affection with a love, into which even
blind indulgence had not introduced slight regard, or feminine caprice.
The difference of their tempers and of their complexions was singularly
striking, although combined, as is usual, with a certain degree of
family resemblance.</p>
<p>The mother of these maidens had been a Scottish lady from the Highlands
of Sutherland, the orphan of a noble chief, who, driven from his own
country during the feuds of the seventeenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> had found shelter
in those peaceful islands, which, amidst poverty and seclusion, were
thus far happy, that they remained unvexed by discord, and unstained by
civil broil. The father (his name was Saint Clair) pined for his native
glen, his feudal tower, his clansmen, and his fallen authority, and died
not long after his arrival in Zetland. The beauty of his orphan
daughter, despite her Scottish lineage, melted the stout heart of Magnus
Troil. He sued and was listened to, and she became his bride; but dying
in the fifth year of their union, left him to mourn his brief period of
domestic happiness.</p>
<p>From her mother, Minna inherited the stately form and dark eyes, the
raven locks and finely-pencilled brows, which showed she was, on one
side at least, a stranger to the blood of Thule. Her cheek,—</p>
<p class="poem">“O call it fair, not pale!”</p>
<p class="noidt">was so slightly and delicately tinged with the rose, that many thought
the lily had an undue proportion in her complexion. But in that
predominance of the paler flower, there was nothing sickly or languid;
it was the true natural colour of health, and corresponded in a peculiar
degree with features, which seemed calculated to express a contemplative
and high-minded character. When Minna Troil heard a tale of woe or of
injustice, it was then her blood rushed to her cheeks, and showed
plainly how warm it beat, notwithstanding the generally serious,
composed, and retiring disposition, which her countenance and demeanour
seemed to exhibit. If strangers sometimes conceived that these fine
features were clouded by melancholy, for which her age and situation
could scarce have given occasion, they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> soon satisfied, upon
further acquaintance, that the placid, mild quietude of her disposition,
and the mental energy of a character which was but little interested in
ordinary and trivial occurrences, was the real cause of her gravity; and
most men, when they knew that her melancholy had no ground in real
sorrow, and was only the aspiration of a soul bent on more important
objects than those by which she was surrounded, might have wished her
whatever could add to her happiness, but could scarce have desired that,
graceful as she was in her natural and unaffected seriousness, she
should change that deportment for one more gay. In short,
notwithstanding our wish to have avoided that hackneyed simile of an
angel, we cannot avoid saying there was something in the serious beauty
of her aspect, in the measured, yet graceful ease of her motions, in the
music of her voice, and the serene purity of her eye, that seemed as if
Minna Troil belonged naturally to some higher and better sphere, and was
only the chance visitant of a world that was not worthy of her.</p>
<p>The scarcely less beautiful, equally lovely, and equally innocent
Brenda, was of a complexion as differing from her sister, as they
differed in character, taste, and expression. Her profuse locks were of
that paly brown which receives from the passing sunbeam a tinge of gold,
but darkens again when the ray has passed from it. Her eye, her mouth,
the beautiful row of teeth, which in her innocent vivacity were
frequently disclosed; the fresh, yet not too bright glow of a healthy
complexion, tinging a skin like the drifted snow, spoke her genuine
Scandinavian descent. A fairy form, less tall than that of Minna, but
still more finely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> moulded into symmetry—a careless, and almost
childish lightness of step—an eye that seemed to look on every object
with pleasure, from a natural and serene cheerfulness of disposition,
attracted even more general admiration than the charms of her sister,
though perhaps that which Minna did excite might be of a more intense as
well as more reverential character.</p>
<p>The dispositions of these lovely sisters were not less different than
their complexions. In the kindly affections, neither could be said to
excel the other, so much were they attached to their father and to each
other. But the cheerfulness of Brenda mixed itself with the every-day
business of life, and seemed inexhaustible in its profusion. The less
buoyant spirit of her sister appeared to bring to society a contented
wish to be interested and pleased with what was going forward, but was
rather placidly carried along with the stream of mirth and pleasure,
than disposed to aid its progress by any efforts of her own. She endured
mirth, rather than enjoyed it; and the pleasures in which she most
delighted, were those of a graver and more solitary cast. The knowledge
which is derived from books was beyond her reach. Zetland afforded few
opportunities, in those days, of studying the lessons, bequeathed</p>
<p class="poem">“By dead men to their kind;”</p>
<p class="noidt">and Magnus Troil, such as we have described him, was not a person within
whose mansion the means of such knowledge were to be acquired. But the
book of nature was before Minna, that noblest of volumes, where we are
ever called to wonder and to admire, even when we cannot understand.
The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> plants of those wild regions, the shells on the shores, and the
long list of feathered clans which haunt their cliffs and eyries, were
as well known to Minna Troil as to the most experienced fowlers. Her
powers of observation were wonderful, and little interrupted by other
tones of feeling. The information which she acquired by habits of
patient attention, was indelibly riveted in a naturally powerful memory.
She had also a high feeling for the solitary and melancholy grandeur of
the scenes in which she was placed. The ocean, in all its varied forms
of sublimity and terror—the tremendous cliffs that resound to the
ceaseless roar of the billows, and the clang of the sea-fowl, had for
Minna a charm in almost every state in which the changing seasons
exhibited them. With the enthusiastic feelings proper to the romantic
race from which her mother descended, the love of natural objects was to
her a passion capable not only of occupying, but at times of agitating,
her mind. Scenes upon which her sister looked with a sense of transient
awe or emotion, which vanished on her return from witnessing them,
continued long to fill Minna’s imagination, not only in solitude, and in
the silence of the night, but in the hours of society. So that sometimes
when she sat like a beautiful statue, a present member of the domestic
circle, her thoughts were far absent, wandering on the wild sea-shore,
and among the yet wilder mountains of her native isles. And yet, when
recalled to conversation, and mingling in it with interest, there were
few to whom her friends were more indebted for enhancing its enjoyments;
and although something in her manners claimed deference (notwithstanding
her early youth) as well as affection, even her gay, lovely, and
amiable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> sister was not more generally beloved than the more retired and
pensive Minna.</p>
<p>Indeed, the two lovely sisters were not only the delight of their
friends, but the pride of those islands, where the inhabitants of a
certain rank were blended, by the remoteness of their situation and the
general hospitality of their habits, into one friendly community. A
wandering poet and parcel-musician, who, after going through various
fortunes, had returned to end his days as he could in his native
islands, had celebrated the daughters of Magnus in a poem, which he
entitled Night and Day; and in his description of Minna, might almost be
thought to have anticipated, though only in a rude outline, the
exquisite lines of Lord Byron,—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“She walks in beauty, like the night</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of cloudless climes and starry skies;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that’s best of dark and bright</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Meet in her aspect, and her eyes:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus mellow’d to that tender light</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which heaven to gaudy day denies.”</span><br>
</p>
<p>Their father loved the maidens both so well, that it might be difficult
to say which he loved best; saving that, perchance, he liked his graver
damsel better in the walk without doors, and his merry maiden better by
the fireside; that he more desired the society of Minna when he was sad,
and that of Brenda when he was mirthful; and, what was nearly the same
thing, preferred Minna before noon, and Brenda after the glass had
circulated in the evening.</p>
<p>But it was still more extraordinary, that the affections of Mordaunt
Mertoun seemed to hover with the same impartiality as those of their
father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> betwixt the two lovely sisters. From his boyhood, as we have
noticed, he had been a frequent inmate of the residence of Magnus at
Burgh-Westra, although it lay nearly twenty miles distant from Jarlshof.
The impassable character of the country betwixt these places, extending
over hills covered with loose and quaking bog, and frequently
intersected by the creeks or arms of the sea, which indent the island on
either side, as well as by fresh-water streams and lakes, rendered the
journey difficult, and even dangerous, in the dark season; yet, as soon
as the state of his father’s mind warned him to absent himself,
Mordaunt, at every risk, and under every difficulty, was pretty sure to
be found the next day at Burgh-Westra, having achieved his journey in
less time than would have been employed perhaps by the most active
native.</p>
<p>He was of course set down as a wooer of one of the daughters of Magnus,
by the public of Zetland; and when the old Udaller’s great partiality to
the youth was considered, nobody doubted that he might aspire to the
hand of either of those distinguished beauties, with as large a share of
islets, rocky moorland, and shore-fishings, as might be the fitting
portion of a favoured child, and with the presumptive prospect of
possessing half the domains of the ancient house of Troil, when their
present owner should be no more. This seemed all a reasonable
speculation, and, in theory at least, better constructed than many that
are current through the world as unquestionable facts. But, alas! all
that sharpness of observation which could be applied to the conduct of
the parties, failed to determine the main point, to which of the young
persons, namely, the attentions of Mordaunt were peculiarly devoted. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
seemed, in general, to treat them as an affectionate and attached
brother might have treated two sisters, so equally dear to him that a
breath would have turned the scale of affection. Or if at any time,
which often happened, the one maiden appeared the more especial object
of his attention, it seemed only to be because circumstances called her
peculiar talents and disposition into more particular and immediate
exercise.</p>
<p>Both the sisters were accomplished in the simple music of the north, and
Mordaunt, who was their assistant, and sometimes their preceptor, when
they were practising this delightful art, might be now seen assisting
Minna in the acquisition of those wild, solemn, and simple airs, to
which scalds and harpers sung of old the deeds of heroes, and presently
found equally active in teaching Brenda the more lively and complicated
music, which their father’s affection caused to be brought from the
English or Scottish capital for the use of his daughters. And while
conversing with them, Mordaunt, who mingled a strain of deep and ardent
enthusiasm with the gay and ungovernable spirits of youth, was equally
ready to enter into the wild and poetical visions of Minna, or into the
lively and often humorous chat of her gayer sister. In short, so little
did he seem to attach himself to either damsel exclusively, that he was
sometimes heard to say, that Minna never looked so lovely, as when her
lighthearted sister had induced her, for the time, to forget her
habitual gravity; or Brenda so interesting, as when she sat listening, a
subdued and affected partaker of the deep pathos of her sister Minna.</p>
<p>The public of the mainland were, therefore, to use the hunter’s phrase,
at fault in their farther con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>clusions, and could but determine, after
long vacillating betwixt the maidens, that the young man was positively
to marry one of them, but which of the two could only be determined when
his approaching manhood, or the interference of stout old Magnus, the
father, should teach Master Mordaunt Mertoun to know his own mind. “It
was a pretty thing, indeed,” they usually concluded, “that he, no native
born, and possessed of no visible means of subsistence that is known to
any one, should presume to hesitate, or affect to have the power of
selection and choice, betwixt the two most distinguished beauties of
Zetland. If they were Magnus Troil, they would soon be at the bottom of
the matter”—and so forth. All which remarks were only whispered, for
the hasty disposition of the Udaller had too much of the old Norse fire
about it to render it safe for any one to become an unauthorized
intermeddler with his family affairs; and thus stood the relation of
Mordaunt Mertoun to the family of Mr. Troil of Burgh-Westra, when the
following incidents took place.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;">

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is no pilgrim’s morning—yon grey mist</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lies upon hill, and dale, and field, and forest,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the dun wimple of a new-made widow;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, by my faith, although my heart be soft,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than, when the tempest sends his voice abroad,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be subject to its fury.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><i>The Double Nuptials.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The spring was far advanced, when, after a week spent in sport and
festivity at Burgh-Westra, Mordaunt Mertoun bade adieu to the family,
pleading the necessity of his return to Jarlshof. The proposal was
combated by the maidens, and more decidedly by Magnus himself: He saw no
occasion whatever for Mordaunt returning to Jarlshof. If his father
desired to see him, which, by the way, Magnus did not believe, Mr.
Mertoun had only to throw himself into the stern of Sweyn’s boat, or
betake himself to a pony, if he liked a land journey better, and he
would see not only his son, but twenty folk besides, who would be most
happy to find that he had not lost the use of his tongue entirely during
his long solitude; “although I must own,” added the worthy Udaller,
“that when he lived among us, nobody ever made less use of it.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt acquiesced both in what respected his father’s taciturnity, and
his dislike to general society; but suggested, at the same time, that
the first circumstance rendered his own immediate return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> more
necessary, as he was the usual channel of communication betwixt his
father and others; and that the second corroborated the same necessity,
since Mr. Mertoun’s having no other society whatever seemed a weighty
reason why his son’s should be restored to him without loss of time. As
to his father’s coming to Burgh-Westra, “they might as well,” he said,
“expect to see Sumburgh Cape come thither.”</p>
<p>“And that would be a cumbrous guest,” said Magnus. “But you will stop
for our dinner to-day? There are the families of Muness, Quendale,
Thorslivoe, and I know not who else, are expected; and, besides the
thirty that were in house this blessed night, we shall have as many more
as chamber and bower, and barn and boat-house, can furnish with beds, or
with barley-straw,—and you will leave all this behind you!”</p>
<p>“And the blithe dance at night,” added Brenda, in a tone betwixt
reproach and vexation; “and the young men from the Isle of Paba that are
to dance the sword-dance, whom shall we find to match them, for the
honour of the Main?”</p>
<p>“There is many a merry dancer on the mainland, Brenda,” replied
Mordaunt, “even if I should never rise on tiptoe again. And where good
dancers are found, Brenda Troil will always find the best partner. I
must trip it to-night through the Wastes of Dunrossness.”</p>
<p>“Do not say so, Mordaunt,” said Minna, who, during this conversation,
had been looking from the window something anxiously; “go not, to-day at
least, through the Wastes of Dunrossness.”</p>
<p>“And why not to-day, Minna,” said Mordaunt, laughing, “any more than
to-morrow?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“O, the morning mist lies heavy upon yonder chain of isles, nor has it
permitted us since daybreak even a single glimpse of Fitful-head, the
lofty cape that concludes yon splendid range of mountains. The fowl are
winging their way to the shore, and the shelldrake seems, through the
mist, as large as the scart.<a id="FNanchor_19_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_23">[19]</a> See, the very sheerwaters and bonxies
are making to the cliffs for shelter.”</p>
<p>“And they will ride out a gale against a king’s frigate,” said her
father; “there is foul weather when they cut and run.”</p>
<p>“Stay, then, with us,” said Minna to her friend; “the storm will be
dreadful, yet it will be grand to see it from Burgh-Westra, if we have
no friend exposed to its fury. See, the air is close and sultry, though
the season is yet so early, and the day so calm, that not a windlestraw
moves on the heath. Stay with us, Mordaunt; the storm which these signs
announce will be a dreadful one.”</p>
<p>“I must be gone the sooner,” was the conclusion of Mordaunt, who could
not deny the signs, which had not escaped his own quick observation. “If
the storm be too fierce, I will abide for the night at Stourburgh.”</p>
<p>“What!” said Magnus; “will you leave us for the new chamberlain’s new
Scotch tacksman, who is to teach all us Zetland savages new ways? Take
your own gate, my lad, if that is the song you sing.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Mordaunt; “I had only some curiosity to see the new
implements he has brought.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, ferlies make fools fain. I would like to know if his new plough
will bear against a Zetland rock?” answered Magnus.</p>
<p>“I must not pass Stourburgh on the journey,” said the youth, deferring
to his patron’s prejudice against innovation, “if this boding weather
bring on tempest; but if it only break in rain, as is most probable, I
am not likely to be melted in the wetting.”</p>
<p>“It will not soften into rain alone,” said Minna; “see how much heavier
the clouds fall every moment, and see these weather-gaws that streak the
lead-coloured mass with partial gleams of faded red and purple.”</p>
<p>“I see them all,” said Mordaunt; “but they only tell me I have no time
to tarry here. Adieu, Minna; I will send you the eagle’s feathers, if an
eagle can be found on Fair-isle or Foulah. And fare thee well, my pretty
Brenda, and keep a thought for me, should the Paba men dance ever so
well.”</p>
<p>“Take care of yourself, since go you will,” said both sisters, together.</p>
<p>Old Magnus scolded them formally for supposing there was any danger to
an active young fellow from a spring gale, whether by sea or land; yet
ended by giving his own caution also to Mordaunt, advising him seriously
to delay his journey, or at least to stop at Stourburgh. “For,” said he,
“second thoughts are best; and as this Scottishman’s howf lies right
under your lee, why, take any port in a storm. But do not be assured to
find the door on latch, let the storm blow ever so hard; there are such
matters as bolts and bars in Scotland,<a id="FNanchor_E_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_E_24">(<i>e</i>)</a> though, thanks to Saint
Ronald, they are unknown here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> save that great lock on the old Castle
of Scalloway, that all men run to see—may be they make part of this
man’s improvements. But go, Mordaunt, since go you will. You should
drink a stirrup-cup now, were you three years older, but boys should
never drink, excepting after dinner; I will drink it for you, that good
customs may not be broken, or bad luck come of it. Here is your bonally,
my lad.” And so saying, he quaffed a rummer glass of brandy with as much
impunity as if it had been spring-water. Thus regretted and cautioned on
all hands, Mordaunt took leave of the hospitable household, and looking
back at the comforts with which it was surrounded, and the dense smoke
that rolled upwards from its chimneys, he first recollected the
guestless and solitary desolation of Jarlshof, then compared with the
sullen and moody melancholy of his father’s temper the warm kindness of
those whom he was leaving, and could not refrain from a sigh at the
thoughts which forced themselves on his imagination.</p>
<p>The signs of the tempest did not dishonour the predictions of Minna.
Mordaunt had not advanced three hours on his journey, before the wind,
which had been so deadly still in the morning, began at first to wail
and sigh, as if bemoaning beforehand the evils which it might perpetrate
in its fury, like a madman in the gloomy state of dejection which
precedes his fit of violence; then gradually increasing, the gale
howled, raged, and roared, with the full fury of a northern storm. It
was accompanied by showers of rain mixed with hail, that dashed with the
most unrelenting rage against the hills and rocks with which the
traveller was surrounded, distracting his attention, in spite of his
utmost exertions, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> rendering it very difficult for him to keep the
direction of his journey in a country where there is neither road, nor
even the slightest track to direct the steps of the wanderer, and where
he is often interrupted by brooks as well as large pools of water,
lakes, and lagoons. All these inland waters were now lashed into sheets
of tumbling foam, much of which, carried off by the fury of the
whirlwind, was mingled with the gale, and transported far from the waves
of which it had lately made a part; while the salt relish of the drift
which was pelted against his face, showed Mordaunt that the spray of the
more distant ocean, disturbed to frenzy by the storm, was mingled with
that of the inland lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Amidst this hideous combustion of the elements, Mordaunt Mertoun
struggled forward as one to whom such elemental war was familiar, and
who regarded the exertions which it required to withstand its fury, but
as a mark of resolution and manhood. He felt even, as happens usually to
those who endure great hardships, that the exertion necessary to subdue
them, is in itself a kind of elevating triumph. To see and distinguish
his path when the cattle were driven from the hill, and the very fowls
from the firmament, was but the stronger proof of his own superiority.
“They shall not hear of me at Burgh-Westra,” said he to himself, “as
they heard of old doited Ringan Ewenson’s boat, that foundered betwixt
roadstead and key. I am more of a cragsman than to mind fire or water,
wave by sea, or quagmire by land.” Thus he struggled on, buffeting with
the storm, supplying the want of the usual signs by which travellers
directed their progress, (for rock, mountain, and headland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> were
shrouded in mist and darkness,) by the instinctive sagacity with which
long acquaintance with these wilds had taught him to mark every minute
object, which could serve in such circumstances to regulate his course.
Thus, we repeat, he struggled onward, occasionally standing still, or
even lying down, when the gust was most impetuous; making way against it
when it was somewhat lulled, by a rapid and bold advance even in its
very current; or, when this was impossible, by a movement resembling
that of a vessel working to windward by short tacks, but never yielding
one inch of the way which he had fought so hard to gain.</p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding Mordaunt’s experience and resolution, his situation
was sufficiently uncomfortable, and even precarious; not because his
sailor’s jacket and trowsers, the common dress of young men through
these isles when on a journey, were thoroughly wet, for that might have
taken place within the same brief time, in any ordinary day, in this
watery climate; but the real danger was, that, notwithstanding his
utmost exertions, he made very slow way through brooks that were sending
their waters all abroad, through morasses drowned in double deluges of
moisture, which rendered all the ordinary passes more than usually
dangerous, and repeatedly obliged the traveller to perform a
considerable circuit, which in the usual case was unnecessary. Thus
repeatedly baffled, notwithstanding his youth and strength, Mordaunt,
after maintaining a dogged conflict with wind, rain, and the fatigue of
a prolonged journey, was truly happy, when, not without having been more
than once mistaken in his road, he at length found himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> within sight
of the house of Stourburgh, or Harfra; for the names were indifferently
given to the residence of Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, who was the chosen
missionary of the Chamberlain of Orkney and Zetland, a speculative
person, who designed, through the medium of Triptolemus, to introduce
into the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the Romans, a spirit of improvement, which at
that early period was scarce known to exist in Scotland itself.</p>
<p>At length, and with much difficulty, Mordaunt reached the house of this
worthy agriculturist, the only refuge from the relentless storm which he
could hope to meet with for several miles; and going straight to the
door, with the most undoubting confidence of instant admission, he was
not a little surprised to find it not merely latched, which the weather
might excuse, but even bolted, a thing which, as Magnus Troil has
already intimated, was almost unknown in the Archipelago. To knock, to
call, and finally to batter the door with staff and stones, were the
natural resources of the youth, who was rendered alike impatient by the
pelting of the storm, and by encountering such most unexpected and
unusual obstacles to instant admission. As he was suffered, however, for
many minutes to exhaust his impatience in noise and clamour, without
receiving any reply, we will employ them in informing the reader who
Triptolemus Yellowley was, and how he came by a name so singular.</p>
<p>Old Jasper Yellowley, the father of Triptolemus, (though born at the
foot of Roseberry-Topping,) had been <i>come over</i> by a certain noble
Scottish Earl, who, proving too far north for canny Yorkshire, had
persuaded him to accept of a farm in the Mearns, where, it is
unnecessary to add, he found matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> very different from what he had
expected. It was in vain that the stout farmer set manfully to work, to
counterbalance, by superior skill, the inconveniences arising from a
cold soil and a weeping climate. These might have been probably
overcome; but his neighbourhood to the Grampians exposed him eternally
to that species of visitation from the plaided gentry, who dwelt within
their skirts, which made young Norval a warrior and a hero, but only
converted Jasper Yellowley into a poor man. This was, indeed, balanced
in some sort by the impression which his ruddy cheek and robust form had
the fortune to make upon Miss Barbara Clinkscale, daughter to the
umquhile, and sister to the then existing, Clinkscale of that ilk.</p>
<p>This was thought a horrid and unnatural union in the neighbourhood,
considering that the house of Clinkscale had at least as great a share
of Scottish pride as of Scottish parsimony, and was amply endowed with
both. But Miss Babie had her handsome fortune of two thousand marks at
her own disposal, was a woman of spirit who had been <i>major</i> and <i>sui
juris</i>, (as the writer who drew the contract assured her,) for full
twenty years; so she set consequences and commentaries alike at
defiance, and wedded the hearty Yorkshire yeoman. Her brother and her
more wealthy kinsmen drew off in disgust, and almost disowned their
degraded relative. But the house of Clinkscale was allied (like every
other family in Scotland at the time) to a set of relations who were not
so nice—tenth and sixteenth cousins, who not only acknowledged their
kinswoman Babie after her marriage with Yellowley but even condescended
to eat beans and bacon (though the latter was then the abomination of
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Scotch as much as of the Jews) with her husband, and would
willingly have cemented the friendship by borrowing a little cash from
him, had not his good lady (who understood trap as well as any woman in
the Mearns) put a negative on this advance to intimacy. Indeed she knew
how to make young Deilbelicket,<a id="FNanchor_F_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_F_24">(<i>f</i>)</a> old Dougald Baresword, the Laird of
Bandybrawl, and others, pay for the hospitality which she did not think
proper to deny them, by rendering them useful in her negotiations with
the lighthanded lads beyond the Cairn, who, finding their late object of
plunder was now allied to “kend folks, and owned by them at kirk and
market,” became satisfied, on a moderate yearly composition, to desist
from their depredations.</p>
<p>This eminent success reconciled Jasper to the dominion which his wife
began to assume over him; and which was much confirmed by her proving to
be—let me see—what is the prettiest mode of expressing it?—in the
family way. On this occasion, Mrs. Yellowley had a remarkable dream, as
is the usual practice of teeming mothers previous to the birth of an
illustrious offspring. She “was a-dreamed,” as her husband expressed it,
that she was safely delivered of a plough, drawn by three yoke of
Angus-shire oxen; and being a mighty investigator into such portents,
she sat herself down with her gossips, to consider what the thing might
mean. Honest Jasper ventured, with much hesitation, to intimate his own
opinion, that the vision had reference rather to things past than things
future, and might have been occasioned by his wife’s nerves having been
a little startled by meeting in the loan above the house his own great
plough with the six oxen, which were the pride of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> his heart. But the
good <i>cummers</i><a id="FNanchor_20_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_25">[20]</a> raised such a hue and cry against this exposition,
that Jasper was fain to put his fingers in his ears, and to run out of
the apartment.</p>
<p>“Hear to him,” said an old whigamore carline—“hear to him, wi’ his
owsen, that are as an idol to him, even as the calf of Bethel! Na,
na—it’s nae pleugh of the flesh that the bonny lad-bairn—for a lad it
sall be—sall e’er striddle between the stilts o’—it’s the pleugh of
the spirit—and I trust mysell to see him wag the head o’ him in a
pu’pit; or, what’s better, on a hill-side.”</p>
<p>“Now the deil’s in your whiggery,” said the old Lady Glenprosing; “wad
ye hae our cummer’s bonny lad-bairn wag the head aff his shouthers like
your godly Mess James Guthrie,<a id="FNanchor_G_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_G_26">(<i>g</i>)</a> that ye hald such a clavering
about?—Na, na, he sall walk a mair siccar path, and be a dainty
curate—and say he should live to be a bishop, what the waur wad he be?”</p>
<p>The gauntlet thus fairly flung down by one sibyl, was caught up by
another, and the controversy between presbytery and episcopacy raged,
roared, or rather screamed, a round of cinnamon-water serving only like
oil to the flame, till Jasper entered with the plough-staff; and by the
awe of his presence, and the shame of misbehaving “before the stranger
man,” imposed some conditions of silence upon the disputants.</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was impatience to give to the light a being
destined to such high and doubtful fates, or whether poor Dame Yellowley
was rather frightened at the hurly-burly which had taken place in her
presence, but she was taken suddenly ill; and, contrary to the formula
in such cases used and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> provided, was soon reported to be “a good deal
worse than was to be expected.” She took the opportunity (having still
all her wits about her) to extract from her sympathetic husband two
promises; first, that he would christen the child, whose birth was like
to cost her so dear, by a name indicative of the vision with which she
had been favoured; and next, that he would educate him for the ministry.
The canny Yorkshireman, thinking she had a good title at present to
dictate in such matters, subscribed to all she required. A man-child was
accordingly born under these conditions, but the state of the mother did
not permit her for many days to enquire how far they had been complied
with. When she was in some degree convalescent, she was informed, that
as it was thought fit the child should be immediately christened, it had
received the name of Triptolemus; the Curate, who was a man of some
classical skill, conceiving that this epithet contained a handsome and
classical allusion to the visionary plough, with its triple yoke of
oxen. Mrs. Yellowley was not much delighted with the manner in which her
request had been complied with; but grumbling being to as little purpose
as in the celebrated case of Tristram Shandy, she e’en sat down
contented with the heathenish name, and endeavoured to counteract the
effects it might produce upon the taste and feelings of the nominee, by
such an education as might put him above the slightest thought of sacks,
coulters, stilts, mould-boards, or any thing connected with the servile
drudgery of the plough.</p>
<p>Jasper, sage Yorkshireman, smiled slyly in his sleeve, conceiving that
young Trippie was likely to prove a chip of the old block, and would
rather take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> after the jolly Yorkshire yeoman, than the gentle but
somewhat <i>aigre</i> blood of the house of Clinkscale. He remarked, with
suppressed glee, that the tune which best answered the purpose of a
lullaby was the “Ploughman’s Whistle,” and the first words the infant
learned to stammer were the names of the oxen; moreover, that the “bern”
preferred home-brewed ale to Scotch twopenny, and never quitted hold of
the tankard with so much reluctance as when there had been, by some
manoeuvre of Jasper’s own device, a double straik of malt allowed to the
brewing, above that which was sanctioned by the most liberal recipe, of
which his dame’s household thrift admitted. Besides this, when no other
means could be fallen upon to divert an occasional fit of squalling, his
father observed that Trip could be always silenced by jingling a bridle
at his ear. From all which symptoms he used to swear in private, that
the boy would prove true Yorkshire, and mother and mother’s kin would
have small share of him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and within a year after the birth of Triptolemus, Mrs.
Yellowley bore a daughter, named after herself Barbara, who, even in
earliest infancy, exhibited the pinched nose and thin lips by which the
Clinkscale family were distinguished amongst the inhabitants of the
Mearns; and as her childhood advanced, the readiness with which she
seized, and the tenacity wherewith she detained, the playthings of
Triptolemus, besides a desire to bite, pinch, and scratch, on slight, or
no provocation, were all considered by attentive observers as proofs,
that Miss Babie would prove “her mother over again.” Malicious people
did not stick to say, that the acrimony of the Clinkscale blood had not,
on this occa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>sion, been cooled and sweetened by that of Old England;
that young Deilbelicket was much about the house, and they could not but
think it odd that Mrs. Yellowley, who, as the whole world knew, gave
nothing for nothing, should be so uncommonly attentive to heap the
trencher, and to fill the caup, of an idle blackguard ne’er-do-weel. But
when folk had once looked upon the austere and awfully virtuous
countenance of Mrs. Yellowley, they did full justice to her propriety of
conduct, and Deilbelicket’s delicacy of taste.</p>
<p>Meantime young Triptolemus, having received such instructions as the
Curate could give him, (for though Dame Yellowley adhered to the
persecuted remnant, her jolly husband, edified by the black gown and
prayer-book, still conformed to the church as by law established,) was,
in due process of time, sent to Saint Andrews to prosecute his studies.
He went, it is true; but with an eye turned back with sad remembrances
on his father’s plough, his father’s pancakes, and his father’s ale, for
which the small-beer of the college, commonly there termed
“thorough-go-nimble,” furnished a poor substitute. Yet he advanced in
his learning, being found, however, to show a particular favour to such
authors of antiquity as had made the improvement of the soil the object
of their researches. He endured the Bucolics of Virgil—the Georgics he
had by heart—but the Æneid he could not away with; and he was
particularly severe upon the celebrated line expressing a charge of
cavalry, because, as he understood the word <i>putrem</i>,<a id="FNanchor_21_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_27">[21]</a> he opined that
the combatants, in their inconsiderate ardour, galloped over a
new-manured ploughed field. Cato, the Roman Censor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> was his favourite
among classical heroes and philosophers, not on account of the
strictness of his morals, but because of his treatise, <i>de Re Rustica</i>.
He had ever in his mouth the phrase of Cicero, <i>Jam neminem antepones
Catoni</i>. He thought well of Palladius, and of Terentius Varro, but
Columella was his pocket-companion. To these ancient worthies, he added
the more modern Tusser, Hartlib, and other writers on rural economics,
not forgetting the lucubrations of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, and
such of the better-informed Philomaths, who, instead of loading their
almanacks with vain predictions of political events, pretended to see
what seeds would grow and what would not, and direct the attention of
their readers to that course of cultivation from which the production of
good crops may be safely predicted; modest sages, in fine, who, careless
of the rise and downfall of empires, content themselves with pointing
out the fit seasons to reap and sow, with a fair guess at the weather
which each month will be likely to present; as, for example, that if
Heaven pleases, we shall have snow in January, and the author will stake
his reputation that July proves, on the whole, a month of sunshine. Now,
although the Rector of Saint Leonard’s was greatly pleased, in general,
with the quiet, laborious, and studious bent of Triptolemus Yellowley,
and deemed him, in so far, worthy of a name of four syllables having a
Latin termination, yet he relished not, by any means, his exclusive
attention to his favourite authors. It savoured of the earth, he said,
if not of something worse, to have a man’s mind always grovelling in
mould, stercorated or unstercorated; and he pointed out, but in vain,
history, and poetry, and divinity, as more elevating subjects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> of
occupation. Triptolemus Yellowley was obstinate in his own course: Of
the battle of Pharsalia, he thought not as it affected the freedom of
the world, but dwelt on the rich crop which the Emathian fields were
likely to produce the next season. In vernacular poetry, Triptolemus
could scarce be prevailed upon to read a single couplet, excepting old
Tusser, as aforesaid, whose Hundred Points of Good Husbandry he had got
by heart; and excepting also Piers Ploughman’s Vision, which, charmed
with the title, he bought with avidity from a packman, but after reading
the two first pages, flung it into the fire as an impudent and misnamed
political libel. As to divinity, he summed that matter up by reminding
his instructors, that to labour the earth and win his bread with the
toil of his body and sweat of his brow, was the lot imposed upon fallen
man; and, for his part, he was resolved to discharge, to the best of his
abilities, a task so obviously necessary to existence, leaving others to
speculate as much as they would, upon the more recondite mysteries of
theology.</p>
<p>With a spirit so much narrowed and limited to the concerns of rural
life, it may be doubted whether the proficiency of Triptolemus in
learning, or the use he was like to make of his acquisitions, would have
much gratified the ambitious hope of his affectionate mother. It is
true, he expressed no reluctance to embrace the profession of a
clergyman, which suited well enough with the habitual personal indolence
which sometimes attaches to speculative dispositions. He had views, to
speak plainly, (I wish they were peculiar to himself,) of cultivating
the <i>glebe</i> six days in the week, preaching on the seventh with due
regularity, and dining with some fat frank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>lin or country laird, with
whom he could smoke a pipe and drink a tankard after dinner, and mix in
secret conference on the exhaustless subject,</p>
<p class="center">Quid faciat lætas segetes.</p>
<p class="noidt">Now, this plan, besides that it indicated nothing of what was then
called the root of the matter, implied necessarily the possession of a
manse; and the possession of a manse inferred compliance with the
doctrines of prelacy, and other enormities of the time. There was some
question how far manse and glebe, stipend, both victual and money, might
have outbalanced the good lady’s predisposition towards Presbytery; but
her zeal was not put to so severe a trial. She died before her son had
completed his studies, leaving her afflicted spouse just as disconsolate
as was to be expected. The first act of old Jasper’s undivided
administration was to recall his son from Saint Andrews, in order to
obtain his assistance in his domestic labours. And here it might have
been supposed that our Triptolemus, summoned to carry into practice what
he had so fondly studied in theory, must have been, to use a simile
which <i>he</i> would have thought lively, like a cow entering upon a clover
park. Alas, mistaken thoughts, and deceitful hopes of mankind!</p>
<p>A laughing philosopher, the Democritus of our day, once, in a moral
lecture, compared human life to a table pierced with a number of holes,
each of which has a pin made exactly to fit it, but which pins being
stuck in hastily, and without selection, chance leads inevitably to the
most awkward mistakes. “For how often do we see,” the orator
pathetically concluded,—“how often, I say, do we see the round man
stuck into the three-cornered hole!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>” This new illustration of the
vagaries of fortune set every one present into convulsions of laughter,
excepting one fat alderman, who seemed to make the case his own, and
insisted that it was no jesting matter. To take up the simile, however,
which is an excellent one, it is plain that Triptolemus Yellowley had
been shaken out of the bag at least a hundred years too soon. If he had
come on the stage in our own time, that is, if he had flourished at any
time within these thirty or forty years, he could not have missed to
have held the office of vice-president of some eminent agricultural
society, and to have transacted all the business thereof under the
auspices of some noble duke or lord, who, as the matter might happen,
either knew, or did not know, the difference betwixt a horse and a cart,
and a cart-horse. He could not have missed such preferment, for he was
exceedingly learned in all those particulars, which, being of no
consequence in actual practice, go, of course, a great way to constitute
the character of a connoisseur in any art, and especially in
agriculture. But, alas! Triptolemus Yellowley had, as we already have
hinted, come into the world at least a century too soon; for, instead of
sitting in an arm-chair, with a hammer in his hand, and a bumper of port
before him, giving forth the toast,—“To breeding, in all its branches,”
his father planted him betwixt the stilts of a plough, and invited him
to guide the oxen, on whose beauties he would, in our day, have
descanted, and whose rumps he would not have goaded, but have carved.
Old Jasper complained, that although no one talked so well of common and
several, wheat and rape, fallow and lea, as his learned son, (whom he
always called Tolimus,) yet, “dang it,” added the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> Seneca, “nought
thrives wi’ un—nought thrives wi’ un!” It was still worse, when Jasper,
becoming frail and ancient, was obliged, as happened in the course of a
few years, gradually to yield up the reins of government to the
academical neophyte.</p>
<p>As if Nature had meant him a spite, he had got one of the <i>dourest</i> and
most intractable farms in the Mearns, to try conclusions withal, a place
which seemed to yield every thing but what the agriculturist wanted; for
there were plenty of thistles, which indicates dry land; and store of
fern, which is said to intimate deep land; and nettles, which show where
lime hath been applied; and deep furrows in the most unlikely spots,
which intimated that it had been cultivated in former days by the
Peghts, as popular tradition bore. There was also enough of stones to
keep the ground warm, according to the creed of some farmers, and great
abundance of springs to render it cool and sappy, according to the
theory of others. It was in vain that, acting alternately on these
opinions, poor Triptolemus endeavoured to avail himself of the supposed
capabilities of the soil. No kind of butter that might be churned could
be made to stick upon his own bread, any more than on that of poor
Tusser, whose Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, so useful to others of
his day, were never to himself worth as many pennies.<a id="FNanchor_22_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_28">[22]</a></p>
<p>In fact, excepting an hundred acres of infield, to which old Jasper had
early seen the necessity of lim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>iting his labours, there was not a
corner of the farm fit for any thing but to break plough-graith, and
kill cattle. And then, as for the part which was really tilled with some
profit, the expense of the farming establishment of Triptolemus, and his
disposition to experiment, soon got rid of any good arising from the
cultivation of it. “The carles and the cart-avers,” he confessed, with a
sigh, speaking of his farm-servants and horses, “make it all, and the
carles and cart-avers eat it all;” a conclusion which might sum up the
year-book of many a gentleman farmer.</p>
<p>Matters would have soon been brought to a close with Triptolemus in the
present day. He would have got a bank-credit, manoeuvred with
wind-bills, dashed out upon a large scale, and soon have seen his crop
and stock sequestered by the Sheriff; but in those days a man could not
ruin himself so easily. The whole Scottish tenantry stood upon the same
level flat of poverty, so that it was extremely difficult to find any
vantage ground, by climbing up to which a man might have an opportunity
of actually breaking his neck with some eclat. They were pretty much in
the situation of people, who, being totally without credit, may indeed
suffer from indigence, but cannot possibly become bankrupt. Besides,
notwithstanding the failure of Triptolemus’s projects, there was to be
balanced against the expenditure which they occasioned, all the savings
which the extreme economy of his sister Barbara could effect; and in
truth her exertions were wonderful. She might have realized, if any one
could, the idea of the learned philosopher, who pronounced that sleeping
was a fancy, and eating but a habit, and who appeared to the world to
have renounced both, until it was unhappily discovered that he had an
intrigue with the cook-maid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> of the family, who indemnified him for his
privations by giving him private entrée to the pantry, and to a share of
her own couch. But no such deceptions were practised by Barbara
Yellowley. She was up early, and down late, and seemed, to her
over-watched and over-tasked maidens, to be as <i>wakerife</i> as the cat
herself. Then, for eating, it appeared that the air was a banquet to
her, and she would fain have made it so to her retinue. Her brother,
who, besides being lazy in his person, was somewhat luxurious in his
appetite, would willingly now and then have tasted a mouthful of animal
food, were it but to know how his sheep were fed off; but a proposal to
eat a child could not have startled Mistress Barbara more; and, being of
a compliant and easy disposition, Triptolemus reconciled himself to the
necessity of a perpetual Lent, too happy when he could get a scrap of
butter to his oaten cake, or (as they lived on the banks of the Esk)
escape the daily necessity of eating salmon, whether in or out of
season, six days out of the seven.</p>
<p>But although Mrs. Barbara brought faithfully to the joint stock all
savings which her awful powers of economy accomplished to scrape
together, and although the dower of their mother was by degrees
expended, or nearly so, in aiding them upon extreme occasions, the term
at length approached when it seemed impossible that they could sustain
the conflict any longer against the evil star of Triptolemus, as he
called it himself, or the natural result of his absurd speculations, as
it was termed by others. Luckily at this sad crisis, a god jumped down
to their relief out of a machine. In plain English, the noble lord, who
owned their farm, arrived at his mansion-house in their neighbourhood,
with his coach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> and six and his running footmen, in the full splendour
of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>This person of quality was the son of the nobleman who had brought the
ancient Jasper into the country from Yorkshire, and he was, like his
father, a fanciful and scheming man.<a id="FNanchor_23_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_29">[23]</a> He had schemed well for
himself, however, amid the mutations of the time, having obtained, for a
certain period of years, the administration of the remote islands of
Orkney and Zetland, for payment of a certain rent, with the right of
making the most of whatever was the property or revenue of the crown in
these districts, under the title of Lord Chamberlain. Now, his lordship
had become possessed with a notion, in itself a very true one, that much
might be done to render this grant available, by improving the culture
of the crown lands, both in Orkney and Zetland; and then having some
acquaintance with our friend Triptolemus, he thought (rather less
happily) that he might prove a person capable of furthering his schemes.
He sent for him to the great Hallhouse, and was so much edified by the
way in which our friend laid down the law upon every given subject
relating to rural economy, that he lost no time in securing the
co-operation of so valuable an assistant, the first step being to
release him from his present unprofitable farm.</p>
<p>The terms were arranged much to the mind of Triptolemus, who had already
been taught, by many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> years’ experience, a dark sort of notion, that
without undervaluing or doubting for a moment his own skill, it would be
quite as well that almost all the trouble and risk should be at the
expense of his employer. Indeed, the hopes of advantage which he held
out to his patron were so considerable, that the Lord Chamberlain
dropped every idea of admitting his dependent into any share of the
expected profits; for, rude as the arts of agriculture were in Scotland,
they were far superior to those known and practised in the regions of
Thule, and Triptolemus Yellowley conceived himself to be possessed of a
degree of insight into these mysteries, far superior to what was
possessed or practised even in the Mearns. The improvement, therefore,
which was to be expected, would bear a double proportion, and the Lord
Chamberlain was to reap all the profit, deducting a handsome salary for
his steward Yellowley, together with the accommodation of a house and
domestic farm, for the support of his family. Joy seized the heart of
Mistress Barbara, at hearing this happy termination of what threatened
to be so very bad an affair as the lease of Cauldacres.</p>
<p>“If we cannot,” she said, “provide for our own house, when all is coming
in, and nothing going out, surely we must be worse than infidels!”</p>
<p>Triptolemus was a busy man for some time, huffing and puffing, and
eating and drinking in every changehouse, while he ordered and collected
together proper implements of agriculture, to be used by the natives of
these devoted islands, whose destinies were menaced with this formidable
change. Singular tools these would seem, if presented before a modern
agricultural society; but every thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> is relative, nor could the heavy
cartload of timber, called the old Scots plough, seem less strange to a
Scottish farmer of this present day, than the corslets and casques of
the soldiers of Cortes might seem to a regiment of our own army. Yet the
latter conquered Mexico, and undoubtedly the former would have been a
splendid improvement on the state of agriculture in Thule.</p>
<p>We have never been able to learn why Triptolemus preferred fixing his
residence in Zetland, to becoming an inhabitant of the Orkneys. Perhaps
he thought the inhabitants of the latter Archipelago the more simple and
docile of the two kindred tribes; or perhaps he considered the situation
of the house and farm he himself was to occupy, (which was indeed a
tolerable one,) as preferable to that which he had it in his power to
have obtained upon Pomona (so the main island of the Orkneys is
entitled). At Harfra, or, as it was sometimes called, Stourburgh, from
the remains of a Pictish fort, which was almost close to the
mansion-house, the factor settled himself, in the plenitude of his
authority; determined to honour the name he bore by his exertions, in
precept and example, to civilize the Zetlanders, and improve their very
confined knowledge in the primary arts of human life.</p>

</p>
<p>We can only hope that the gentle reader has not found the latter part of
the last chapter extremely tedious; but, at any rate, his impatience
will scarce equal that of young Mordaunt Mertoun, who, while the
lightning came flash after flash, while the wind, veering and shifting
from point to point, blew with all the fury of a hurricane, and while
the rain was dashed against him in deluges, stood hammering, calling,
and roaring at the door of the old Place of Harfra, impatient for
admittance, and at a loss to conceive any position of existing
circumstances, which could occasion the exclusion of a stranger,
especially during such horrible weather. At length, finding his noise
and vociferation were equally in vain, he fell back so far from the
front of the house, as was necessary to enable him to reconnoitre the
chimneys; and amidst “storm and shade,” could discover, to the increase
of his dismay, that though noon, then the dinner hour of these islands,
was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> now nearly arrived, there was no smoke proceeding from the tunnels
of the vents to give any note of preparation within.</p>
<p>Mordaunt’s wrathful impatience was now changed into sympathy and alarm;
for, so long accustomed to the exuberant hospitality of the Zetland
islands, he was immediately induced to suppose some strange and
unaccountable disaster had befallen the family; and forthwith set
himself to discover some place at which he could make forcible entry, in
order to ascertain the situation of the inmates, as much as to obtain
shelter from the still increasing storm. His present anxiety was,
however, as much thrown away as his late clamorous importunities for
admittance had been. Triptolemus and his sister had heard the whole
alarm without, and had already had a sharp dispute on the propriety of
opening the door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baby, as we have described her, was no willing renderer of the
rites of hospitality. In their farm of Cauldacres, in the Mearns, she
had been the dread and abhorrence of all gaberlunzie men, and travelling
packmen, gipsies, long remembered beggars, and so forth; nor was there
one of them so wily, as she used to boast, as could ever say they had
heard the clink of her sneck. In Zetland, where the new settlers were
yet strangers to the extreme honesty and simplicity of all classes,
suspicion and fear joined with frugality in her desire to exclude all
wandering guests of uncertain character; and the second of these motives
had its effect on Triptolemus himself, who, though neither suspicious
nor penurious, knew good people were scarce, good farmers scarcer, and
had a reasonable share of that wisdom which looks towards
self-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>preservation as the first law of nature. These hints may serve as
a commentary on the following dialogue which took place betwixt the
brother and sister.</p>
<p>“Now, good be gracious to us,” said Triptolemus, as he sat thumbing his
old school-copy of Virgil, “here is a pure day, for the bear seed!—Well
spoke the wise Mantuan—<i>ventis surgentibus</i>—and then the groans of the
mountains, and the long-resounding shores—but where’s the woods, Baby?
tell me, I say, where we shall find the <i>nemorum murmur</i>, sister Baby,
in these new seats of ours?”</p>
<p>“What’s your foolish will?” said Baby, popping her head from out of a
dark recess in the kitchen, where she was busy about some nameless deed
of housewifery.</p>
<p>Her brother, who had addressed himself to her more from habit than
intention, no sooner saw her bleak red nose, keen grey eyes, with the
sharp features thereunto conforming, shaded by the flaps of the loose
<i>toy</i> which depended on each side of her eager face, than he bethought
himself that his query was likely to find little acceptation from her,
and therefore stood another volley before he would resume the topic.</p>
<p>“I say, Mr. Yellowley,” said sister Baby, coming into the middle of the
room, “what for are ye crying on me, and me in the midst of my
housewifeskep?”</p>
<p>“Nay, for nothing at all, Baby,” answered Triptolemus, “saving that I
was saying to myself, that here we had the sea, and the wind, and the
rain, sufficient enough, but where’s the wood? where’s the wood, Baby,
answer me that?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“The wood?” replied Baby—“Were I no to take better care of the wood
than you, brother, there would soon be no more wood about the town than
the barber’s block that’s on your own shoulders, Triptolemus. If ye be
thinking of the wreck-wood that the callants brought in yesterday, there
was six ounces of it gaed to boil your parritch this morning; though, I
trow, a carefu’ man wad have ta’en drammock, if breakfast he behoved to
have, rather than waste baith meltith and fuel in the same morning.”</p>
<p>“That is to say, Baby,” replied Triptolemus, who was somewhat of a dry
joker in his way, “that when we have fire we are not to have food, and
when we have food we are not to have fire, these being too great
blessings to enjoy both in the same day! Good luck, you do not propose
we should starve with cold and starve with hunger <i>unico contextu</i>. But,
to tell you the truth, I could never away with raw oatmeal, slockened
with water, in all my life. Call it drammock, or crowdie, or just what
ye list, my vivers must thole fire and water.”</p>
<p>“The mair gowk you,” said Baby; “can ye not make your brose on the
Sunday, and sup them cauld on the Monday, since ye’re sae dainty? Mony
is the fairer face than yours that has licked the lip after such a
cogfu’.”</p>
<p>“Mercy on us, sister!” said Triptolemus; “at this rate, it’s a finished
field with me—I must unyoke the pleugh, and lie down to wait for the
dead-thraw. Here is that in this house wad hold all Zetland in meal for
a twelvemonth, and ye grudge a cogfu’ of warm parritch to me, that has
sic a charge!”</p>
<p>“Whisht—haud your silly clavering tongue!” said Baby, looking round
with apprehension—“ye are a wise man to speak of what is in the house,
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> a fitting man to have the charge of it!—Hark, as I live by bread,
I hear a tapping at the outer yett!”</p>
<p>“Go and open it then, Baby,” said her brother, glad at any thing that
promised to interrupt the dispute.</p>
<p>“Go and open it, said he!” echoed Baby, half angry, half frightened, and
half triumphant at the superiority of her understanding over that of her
brother—“Go and open it, said he, indeed!—is it to lend robbers a
chance to take all that is in the house?”</p>
<p>“Robbers!” echoed Triptolemus, in his turn; “there are no more robbers
in this country than there are lambs at Yule. I tell you, as I have told
you an hundred times, there are no Highlandmen to harry us here. This is
a land of quiet and honesty. <i>O fortunati nimium!</i>”</p>
<p>“And what good is Saint Rinian to do ye, Tolimus?” said his sister,
mistaking the quotation for a Catholic invocation. “Besides, if there be
no Highlandmen, there may be as bad. I saw sax or seven as ill-looking
chields gang past the Place yesterday, as ever came frae beyont
Clochna-ben; ill-fa’red tools they had in their hands, whaaling knives
they ca’ed them, but they looked as like dirks and whingers as ae bit
airn can look like anither. There is nae honest men carry siccan tools.”</p>
<p>Here the knocking and shouts of Mordaunt were very audible betwixt every
swell of the horrible blast which was careering without. The brother and
sister looked at each other in real perplexity and fear. “If they have
heard of the siller,” said Baby, her very nose changing with terror from
red to blue, “we are but gane folk!”</p>
<p>“Who speaks now, when they should hold their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> tongue?” said Triptolemus.
“Go to the shot-window instantly, and see how many there are of them,
while I load the old Spanish-barrelled duck-gun—go as if you were
stepping on new-laid eggs.”</p>
<p>Baby crept to the window, and reported that she saw only “one young
chield, clattering and roaring as gin he were daft. How many there might
be out of sight, she could not say.”</p>
<p>“Out of sight!—nonsense,” said Triptolemus, laying aside the ramrod
with which he was loading the piece, with a trembling hand. “I will
warrant them out of sight and hearing both—this is some poor fellow
catched in the tempest, wants the shelter of our roof, and a little
refreshment. Open the door, Baby, it’s a Christian deed.”</p>
<p>“But is it a Christian deed of him to come in at the window, then?” said
Baby, setting up a most doleful shriek, as Mordaunt Mertoun, who had
forced open one of the windows, leaped down into the apartment, dripping
with water like a river god. Triptolemus, in great tribulation,
presented the gun which he had not yet loaded, while the intruder
exclaimed, “Hold, hold—what the devil mean you by keeping your doors
bolted in weather like this, and levelling your gun at folk’s heads as
you would at a sealgh’s?”</p>
<p>“And who are you, friend, and what want you?” said Triptolemus, lowering
the but of his gun to the floor as he spoke, and so recovering his arms.</p>
<p>“What do I want!” said Mordaunt; “I want every thing—I want meat,
drink, and fire, a bed for the night, and a sheltie for to-morrow
morning to carry me to Jarlshof.”</p>
<p>“And ye said there were nae caterans or sorners here?” said Baby to the
agriculturist, reproachfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> “Heard ye ever a breekless loon frae
Lochaber tell his mind and his errand mair deftly?—Come, come, friend,”
she added, addressing herself to Mordaunt, “put up your pipes and gang
your gate; this is the house of his lordship’s factor, and no place of
reset for thiggers or sorners.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt laughed in her face at the simplicity of the request. “Leave
built walls,” he said, “and in such a tempest as this? What take you me
for?—a gannet or a scart do you think I am, that your clapping your
hands and skirling at me like a madwoman, should drive me from the
shelter into the storm?”</p>
<p>“And so you propose, young man,” said Triptolemus, gravely, “to stay in
my house, <i>volens nolens</i>—that is, whether we will or no?”</p>
<p>“Will!” said Mordaunt; “what right have you to will any thing about it?
Do you not hear the thunder? Do you not hear the rain? Do you not see
the lightning? And do you not know this is the only house within I wot
not how many miles? Come, my good master and dame, this may be Scottish
jesting, but it sounds strange in Zetland ears. You have let out the
fire, too, and my teeth are dancing a jig in my head with cold; but I’ll
soon put that to rights.”</p>
<p>He seized the fire-tongs, raked together the embers upon the hearth,
broke up into life the gathering-peat, which the hostess had calculated
should have preserved the seeds of fire, without giving them forth, for
many hours; then casting his eye round, saw in a corner the stock of
drift-wood, which Mistress Baby had served forth by ounces, and
transferred two or three logs of it at once to the hearth, which,
conscious of such unwonted supply, began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> transmit to the chimney
such a smoke as had not issued from the Place of Harfra for many a day.</p>
<p>While their uninvited guest was thus making himself at home, Baby kept
edging and jogging the factor to turn out the intruder. But for this
undertaking, Triptolemus Yellowley felt neither courage nor zeal, nor
did circumstances seem at all to warrant the favourable conclusion of
any fray into which he might enter with the young stranger. The sinewy
limbs and graceful form of Mordaunt Mertoun were seen to great advantage
in his simple sea-dress; and with his dark sparkling eye, finely formed
head, animated features, close curled dark hair, and bold, free looks,
the stranger formed a very strong contrast with the host on whom he had
intruded himself. Triptolemus was a short, clumsy, duck-legged disciple
of Ceres, whose bottle-nose, turned up and handsomely coppered at the
extremity, seemed to intimate something of an occasional treaty with
Bacchus. It was like to be no equal mellay betwixt persons of such
unequal form and strength; and the difference betwixt twenty and fifty
years was nothing in favour of the weaker party. Besides, the factor was
an honest good-natured fellow at bottom, and being soon satisfied that
his guest had no other views than those of obtaining refuge from the
storm, it would, despite his sister’s instigations, have been his last
act to deny a boon so reasonable and necessary to a youth whose exterior
was so prepossessing. He stood, therefore, considering how he could most
gracefully glide into the character of the hospitable landlord, out of
that of the churlish defender of his domestic castle, against an
unauthorized intrusion, when Baby, who had stood appalled at the extreme
familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> of the stranger’s address and demeanour, now spoke up for
herself.</p>
<p>“My troth, lad,” said she to Mordaunt, “ye are no blate, to light on at
that rate, and the best of wood, too—nane of your sharney peats, but
good aik timber, nae less maun serve ye!”</p>
<p>“You come lightly by it, dame,” said Mordaunt, carelessly; “and you
should not grudge to the fire what the sea gives you for nothing. These
good ribs of oak did their last duty upon earth and ocean, when they
could hold no longer together under the brave hearts that manned the
bark.”</p>
<p>“And that’s true, too,” said the old woman, softening—“this maun be
awsome weather by sea. Sit down and warm ye, since the sticks are
a-low.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said Triptolemus, “it is a pleasure to see siccan a bonny
bleeze. I havena seen the like o’t since I left Cauldacres.”</p>
<p>“And shallna see the like o’t again in a hurry,” said Baby, “unless the
house take fire, or there suld be a coal-heugh found out.”</p>
<p>“And wherefore should not there be a coal-heugh found out?” said the
factor, triumphantly—“I say, wherefore should not a coal-heugh be found
out in Zetland as well as in Fife, now that the Chamberlain has a
far-sighted and discreet man upon the spot to make the necessary
perquisitions? They are baith fishing-stations, I trow?”</p>
<p>“I tell you what it is, Tolemus Yellowley,” answered his sister, who had
practical reasons to fear her brother’s opening upon any false scent,
“if you promise my Lord sae mony of these bonnie-wallies, we’ll no be
weel hafted here before we are found out and set a-trotting again. If
ane was to speak to ye about a gold mine, I ken weel wha would promise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
he suld have Portugal pieces clinking in his pouch before the year gaed
by.”</p>
<p>“And why suld I not?” said Triptolemus—“maybe your head does not know
there is a land in Orkney called Ophir, or something very like it; and
wherefore might not Solomon, the wise King of the Jews, have sent
thither his ships and his servants for four hundred and fifty talents? I
trow he knew best where to go or send, and I hope you believe in your
Bible, Baby?”</p>
<p>Baby was silenced by an appeal to Scripture, however <i>mal à propos</i>, and
only answered by an inarticulate <i>humph</i> of incredulity or scorn, while
her brother went on addressing Mordaunt.—“Yes, you shall all of you see
what a change shall coin introduce, even into such an unpropitious
country as yours. Ye have not heard of copper, I warrant, nor of
iron-stone, in these islands, neither?” Mordaunt said he had heard there
was copper near the Cliffs of Konigsburgh. “Ay, and a copper scum is
found on the Loch of Swana, too, young man. But the youngest of you,
doubtless, thinks himself a match for such as I am!”</p>
<p>Baby, who during all this while had been closely and accurately
reconnoitring the youth’s person, now interposed in a manner by her
brother totally unexpected. “Ye had mair need, Mr. Yellowley, to give
the young man some dry clothes, and to see about getting something for
him to eat, than to sit there bleezing away with your lang tales, as if
the weather were not windy enow without your help; and maybe the lad
would drink some <i>bland</i>, or sic-like, if ye had the grace to ask him.”</p>
<p>While Triptolemus looked astonished at such a proposal, considering the
quarter it came from, Mor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>daunt answered, he “should be very glad to
have dry clothes, but begged to be excused from drinking until he had
eaten somewhat.”</p>
<p>Triptolemus accordingly conducted him into another apartment, and
accommodating him with a change of dress, left him to his arrangements,
while he himself returned to the kitchen, much puzzled to account for
his sister’s unusual fit of hospitality. “She must be <i>fey</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_24_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_30">[24]</a> he
said, “and in that case has not long to live, and though I fall heir to
her tocher-good, I am sorry for it; for she has held the house-gear well
together—drawn the girth over tight it may be now and then, but the
saddle sits the better.”</p>
<p>When Triptolemus returned to the kitchen, he found his suspicions
confirmed; for his sister was in the desperate act of consigning to the
pot a smoked goose, which, with others of the same tribe, had long hung
in the large chimney, muttering to herself at the same time,—“It maun
be eaten sune or syne, and what for no by the puir callant?”</p>
<p>“What is this of it, sister?” said Triptolemus. “You have on the girdle
and the pot at ance. What day is this wi’ you?”</p>
<p>“E’en such a day as the Israelites had beside the flesh-pots of Egypt,
billie Triptolemus; but ye little ken wha ye have in your house this
blessed day.”</p>
<p>“Troth, and little do I ken,” said Triptolemus, “as little as I would
ken the naig I never saw before. I would take the lad for a jagger,<a id="FNanchor_25_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_31">[25]</a>
but he has rather ower good havings, and he has no pack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Ye ken as little as ane of your ain bits o’ nowt, man,” retorted sister
Baby; “if ye ken na him, do ye ken Tronda Dronsdaughter?”</p>
<p>“Tronda Dronsdaughter!” echoed Triptolemus—“how should I but ken her,
when I pay her twal pennies Scots by the day, for working in the house
here? I trow she works as if the things burned her fingers. I had better
give a Scots lass a groat of English siller.”</p>
<p>“And that’s the maist sensible word ye have said this blessed
morning.—Weel, but Tronda kens this lad weel, and she has often spoke
to me about him. They call his father the Silent Man of Sumburgh, and
they say he’s uncanny.”</p>
<p>“Hout, hout—nonsense, nonsense—they are aye at sic trash as that,”
said the brother, “when you want a day’s wark out of them—they have
stepped ower the tangs, or they have met an uncanny body, or they have
turned about the boat against the sun, and then there’s nought to be
done that day.”</p>
<p>“Weel, weel, brother, ye are so wise,” said Baby, “because ye knapped
Latin at Saint Andrews; and can your lair tell me, then, what the lad
has round his halse?”</p>
<p>“A Barcelona napkin, as wet as a dishclout, and I have just lent him one
of my own overlays,” said Triptolemus.</p>
<p>“A Barcelona napkin!” said Baby, elevating her voice, and then suddenly
lowering it, as from apprehension of being overheard—“I say a gold
chain!”</p>
<p>“A gold chain!” said Triptolemus.</p>
<p>“In troth is it, hinny; and how like you that? The folk say here, as
Tronda tells me, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> King of the Drows gave it to his father, the
Silent Man of Sumburgh.”</p>
<p>“I wish you would speak sense, or be the silent woman,” said
Triptolemus. “The upshot of it all is, then, that this lad is the rich
stranger’s son, and that you are giving him the goose you were to keep
till Michaelmas!”</p>
<p>“Troth, brother, we maun do something for God’s sake, and to make
friends; and the lad,” added Baby, (for even she was not altogether
above the prejudices of her sex in favour of outward form,) “the lad has
a fair face of his ain.”</p>
<p>“Ye would have let mony a fair face,” said Triptolemus, “pass the door
pining, if it had not been for the gold chain.”</p>
<p>“Nae doubt, nae doubt,” replied Barbara; “ye wadna have me waste our
substance on every thigger or sorner that has the luck to come by the
door in a wet day? But this lad has a fair and a wide name in the
country, and Tronda says he is to be married to a daughter of the rich
Udaller, Magnus Troil, and the marriage-day is to be fixed whenever he
makes choice (set him up) between the twa lasses; and so it wad be as
much as our good name is worth, and our quiet forby, to let him sit
unserved, although he does come unsent for.”</p>
<p>“The best reason in life,” said Triptolemus, “for letting a man into a
house is, that you dare not bid him go by. However, since there is a man
of quality amongst them, I will let him know whom he has to do with, in
my person.” Then advancing to the door, he exclaimed, “<i>Heus tibi,
Dave!</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Adsum</i>,” answered the youth, entering the apartment.</p>
<p>“Hem!” said the erudite Triptolemus, “not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> altogether deficient in his
humanities, I see. I will try him further.—Canst thou aught of
husbandry, young gentleman?”</p>
<p>“Troth, sir, not I,” answered Mordaunt; “I have been trained to plough
upon the sea, and to reap upon the crag.”</p>
<p>“Plough the sea!” said Triptolemus; “that’s a furrow requires small
harrowing; and for your harvest on the crag, I suppose you mean these
<i>scowries</i>, or whatever you call them. It is a sort of ingathering which
the Ranzelman should stop by the law; nothing more likely to break an
honest man’s bones. I profess I cannot see the pleasure men propose by
dangling in a rope’s-end betwixt earth and heaven. In my case, I had as
lief the other end of the rope were fastened to the gibbet; I should be
sure of not falling, at least.”</p>
<p>“Now, I would only advise you to try it,” replied Mordaunt. “Trust me,
the world has few grander sensations than when one is perched in midair
between a high-browed cliff and a roaring ocean, the rope by which you
are sustained seeming scarce stronger than a silken thread, and the
stone on which you have one foot steadied, affording such a breadth as
the kittywake might rest upon—to feel and know all this, with the full
confidence that your own agility of limb, and strength of head, can
bring you as safe off as if you had the wing of the gosshawk—this is
indeed being almost independent of the earth you tread on!”</p>
<p>Triptolemus stared at this enthusiastic description of an amusement
which had so few charms for him; and his sister, looking at the glancing
eye and elevated bearing of the young adventurer, answered, by
ejaculating, “My certie, lad, but ye are a brave chield!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“A brave chield?” returned Yellowley,—“I say a brave goose, to be
flichtering and fleeing in the wind when he might abide upon <i>terra
firma</i>! But come, here’s a goose that is more to the purpose, when once
it is well boiled. Get us trenchers and salt, Baby—but in truth it will
prove salt enough—a tasty morsel it is; but I think the Zetlanders be
the only folk in the world that think of running such risks to catch
geese, and then boiling them when they have done.”</p>
<p>“To be sure,” replied his sister, (it was the only word they had agreed
in that day,) “it would be an unco thing to bid ony gudewife in Angus or
a’ the Mearns boil a goose, while there was sic things as spits in the
warld.—But wha’s this neist!” she added, looking towards the entrance
with great indignation. “My certie, open doors, and dogs come in—and
wha opened the door to him?”</p>
<p>“I did, to be sure,” replied Mordaunt; “you would not have a poor devil
stand beating your deaf door-cheeks in weather like this?—Here goes
something, though, to help the fire,” he added, drawing out the sliding
bar of oak with which the door had been secured, and throwing it on the
hearth, whence it was snatched by Dame Baby in great wrath, she
exclaiming at the same time,—</p>
<p>“It’s sea-borne timber, as there’s little else here, and he dings it
about as if it were a fir-clog!—And who be you, an it please you?” she
added, turning to the stranger,—“a very hallanshaker loon, as ever
crossed my twa een!”</p>
<p>“I am a jagger, if it like your ladyship,” replied the uninvited guest,
a stout vulgar, little man, who had indeed the humble appearance of a
pedlar, called <i>jagger</i> in these islands—“never travelled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> a waur
day, or was more willing to get to harbourage.—Heaven be praised for
fire and house-room!”</p>
<p>So saying, he drew a stool to the fire, and sat down without further
ceremony. Dame Baby stared “wild as grey gosshawk,” and was meditating
how to express her indignation in something warmer than words, for which
the boiling pot seemed to offer a convenient hint, when an old
half-starved serving-woman—the Tronda already mentioned—the sharer of
Barbara’s domestic cares, who had been as yet in some remote corner of
the mansion, now hobbled into the room, and broke out into exclamations
which indicated some new cause of alarm.</p>
<p>“O master!” and “O mistress!” were the only sounds she could for some
time articulate, and then followed them up with, “The best in the
house—the best in the house—set a’ on the board, and a’ will be little
aneugh—There is auld Norna of Fitful-head, the most fearful woman in
all the isles!”</p>
<p>“Where can she have been wandering?” said Mordaunt, not without some
apparent sympathy with the surprise, if not with the alarm, of the old
domestic; “but it is needless to ask—the worse the weather, the more
likely is she to be a traveller.”</p>
<p>“What new tramper is this?” echoed the distracted Baby, whom the quick
succession of guests had driven wellnigh crazy with vexation. “I’ll soon
settle her wandering, I sall warrant, if my brother has but the saul of
a man in him, or if there be a pair of jougs at Scalloway!”</p>
<p>“The iron was never forged on stithy that would hauld her,” said the old
maid-servant. “She comes—she comes—God’s sake speak her fair and
canny, or we will have a ravelled hasp on the yarn-windles!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>”</p>
<p>As she spoke, a woman, tall enough almost to touch the top of the door
with her cap, stepped into the room, signing the cross as she entered,
and pronouncing, with a solemn voice, “The blessing of God and Saint
Ronald on the open door, and their broad malison and mine upon
close-handed churls!”</p>
<p>“And wha are ye, that are sae bauld wi’ your blessing and banning in
other folk’s houses? What kind of country is this, that folk cannot sit
quiet for an hour, and serve Heaven, and keep their bit gear thegither,
without gangrel men and women coming thigging and sorning ane after
another, like a string of wild-geese?”</p>
<p>This speech, the understanding reader will easily saddle on Mistress
Baby, and what effects it might have produced on the last stranger, can
only be matter of conjecture; for the old servant and Mordaunt applied
themselves at once to the party addressed, in order to deprecate her
resentment; the former speaking to her some words of Norse, in a tone of
intercession, and Mordaunt saying in English, “They are strangers,
Norna, and know not your name or qualities; they are unacquainted, too,
with the ways of this country, and therefore we must hold them excused
for their lack of hospitality.”</p>
<p>“I lack no hospitality, young man,” said Triptolemus, “<i>miseris
succurrere disco</i>—the goose that was destined to roost in the chimney
till Michaelmas, is boiling in the pot for you; but if we had twenty
geese, I see we are like to find mouths to eat them every feather—this
must be amended.”</p>
<p>“What must be amended, sordid slave?” said the stranger Norna, turning
at once upon him with an emphasis that made him start—“<i>What</i> must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
amended? Bring hither, if thou wilt, thy new-fangled coulters, spades,
and harrows, alter the implements of our fathers from the ploughshare to
the mouse-trap; but know thou art in the land that was won of old by the
flaxen-haired Kempions of the North, and leave us their hospitality at
least, to show we come of what was once noble and generous. I say to you
beware—while Norna looks forth at the measureless waters, from the
crest of Fitful-head, something is yet left that resembles power of
defence. If the men of Thule have ceased to be champions, and to spread
the banquet for the raven, the women have not forgotten the arts that
lifted them of yore into queens and prophetesses.”</p>
<p>The woman who pronounced this singular tirade, was as striking in
appearance as extravagantly lofty in her pretensions and in her
language. She might well have represented on the stage, so far as
features, voice, and stature, were concerned, the Bonduca or Boadicea of
the Britons, or the sage Velleda, Aurinia, or any other fated Pythoness,
who ever led to battle a tribe of the ancient Goths. Her features were
high and well formed, and would have been handsome, but for the ravages
of time and the effects of exposure to the severe weather of her
country. Age, and perhaps sorrow, had quenched, in some degree, the fire
of a dark-blue eye, whose hue almost approached to black, and had
sprinkled snow on such parts of her tresses as had escaped from under
her cap, and were dishevelled by the rigour of the storm. Her upper
garment, which dropped with water, was of a coarse dark-coloured stuff,
called wadmaal, then much used in the Zetland islands, as also in
Iceland and Norway. But as she threw this cloak back from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> her
shoulders, a short jacket, of dark-blue velvet, stamped with figures,
became visible, and the vest, which corresponded to it, was of crimson
colour, and embroidered with tarnished silver. Her girdle was plated
with silver ornaments, cut into the shape of planetary signs—her blue
apron was embroidered with similar devices, and covered a petticoat of
crimson cloth. Strong thick enduring shoes, of the half-dressed leather
of the country, were tied with straps like those of the Roman buskins,
over her scarlet stockings. She wore in her belt an ambiguous-looking
weapon, which might pass for a sacrificing knife, or dagger, as the
imagination of the spectator chose to assign to the wearer the character
of a priestess or of a sorceress. In her hand she held a staff, squared
on all sides, and engraved with Runic characters and figures, forming
one of those portable and perpetual calendars which were used among the
ancient natives of Scandinavia, and which, to a superstitious eye, might
have passed for a divining rod.</p>
<p>Such were the appearance, features, and attire, of Norna of the
Fitful-head, upon whom many of the inhabitants of the island looked with
observance, many with fear, and almost all with a sort of veneration.
Less pregnant circumstances of suspicion would, in any other part of
Scotland, have exposed her to the investigation of those cruel
inquisitors, who were then often invested with the delegated authority
of the Privy Council, for the purpose of persecuting, torturing, and
finally consigning to the flames, those who were accused of witchcraft
or sorcery. But superstitions of this nature pass through two stages ere
they become entirely obsolete. Those supposed to be possessed of
supernatural powers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> are venerated in the earlier stages of society. As
religion and knowledge increase, they are first held in hatred and
horror, and are finally regarded as impostors. Scotland was in the
second state—the fear of witchcraft was great, and the hatred against
those suspected of it intense. Zetland was as yet a little world by
itself, where, among the lower and ruder classes, so much of the ancient
northern superstition remained, as cherished the original veneration for
those affecting supernatural knowledge, and power over the elements,
which made a constituent part of the ancient Scandinavian creed. At
least if the natives of Thule admitted that one class of magicians
performed their feats by their alliance with Satan, they devoutly
believed that others dealt with spirits of a different and less odious
class—the ancient Dwarfs, called, in Zetland, Trows, or Drows, the
modern fairies, and so forth.</p>
<p>Among those who were supposed to be in league with disembodied spirits,
this Norna, descended from, and representative of, a family, which had
long pretended to such gifts, was so eminent, that the name assigned to
her, which signifies one of those fatal sisters who weave the web of
human fate, had been conferred in honour of her supernatural powers. The
name by which she had been actually christened was carefully concealed
by herself and her parents; for to its discovery they superstitiously
annexed some fatal consequences. In those times, the doubt only
occurred, whether her supposed powers were acquired by lawful means. In
our days, it would have been questioned whether she was an impostor, or
whether her imagination was so deeply impressed with the mysteries of
her supposed art, that she might be in some degree a believer in her
own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> pretensions to supernatural knowledge. Certain it is, that she
performed her part with such undoubting confidence, and such striking
dignity of look and action, and evinced, at the same time, such strength
of language, and energy of purpose, that it would have been difficult
for the greatest sceptic to have doubted the reality of her enthusiasm,
though he might smile at the pretensions to which it gave rise.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">——If, by your art, you have</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><i>Tempest.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The storm had somewhat relaxed its rigour just before the entrance of
Norna, otherwise she must have found it impossible to travel during the
extremity of its fury. But she had hardly added herself so unexpectedly
to the party whom chance had assembled at the dwelling of Triptolemus
Yellowley, when the tempest suddenly resumed its former vehemence, and
raged around the building with a fury which made the inmates insensible
to any thing except the risk that the old mansion was about to fall
above their heads.</p>
<p>Mistress Baby gave vent to her fears in loud exclamations of “The Lord
guide us—this is surely the last day—what kind of a country of
guisards and gyre-carlines is this!—and you, ye fool carle,” she added,
turning on her brother, (for all her passions had a touch of acidity in
them,) “to quit the bonny Mearns land to come here, where there is
naething but sturdy beggars and gaberlunzies within ane’s house, and
Heaven’s anger on the outside on’t!”</p>
<p>“I tell you, sister Baby,” answered the insulted agriculturist, “that
all shall be reformed and amended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>—excepting,” he added, betwixt his
teeth, “the scaulding humours of an ill-natured jaud, that can add
bitterness to the very storm!”</p>
<p>The old domestic and the pedlar meanwhile exhausted themselves in
entreaties to Norna, of which, as they were couched in the Norse
language, the master of the house understood nothing.</p>
<p>She listened to them with a haughty and unmoved air, and replied at
length aloud, and in English—“I will not. What if this house be strewed
in ruins before morning—where would be the world’s want in the crazed
projector, and the niggardly pinch-commons, by which it is inhabited?
They will needs come to reform Zetland customs, let them try how they
like a Zetland storm.—You that would not perish, quit this house!”</p>
<p>The pedlar seized on his little knapsack, and began hastily to brace it
on his back; the old maid-servant cast her cloak about her shoulders,
and both seemed to be in the act of leaving the house as fast as they
could.</p>
<p>Triptolemus Yellowley, somewhat commoved by these appearances, asked
Mordaunt, with a voice which faltered with apprehension, whether he
thought there was any, that is, so very much danger?</p>
<p>“I cannot tell,” answered the youth, “I have scarce ever seen such a
storm. Norna can tell us better than any one when it will abate; for no
one in these islands can judge of the weather like her.”</p>
<p>“And is that all thou thinkest Norna can do?” said the sibyl; “thou
shalt know her powers are not bounded within such a narrow space. Hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
me, Mordaunt, youth of a foreign land, but of a friendly heart—Dost
thou quit this doomed mansion with those who now prepare to leave it?”</p>
<p>“I do not—I will not, Norna,” replied Mordaunt; “I know not your motive
for desiring me to remove, and I will not leave, upon these dark
threats, the house in which I have been kindly received in such a
tempest as this. If the owners are unaccustomed to our practice of
unlimited hospitality, I am the more obliged to them that they have
relaxed their usages, and opened their doors in my behalf.”</p>
<p>“He is a brave lad,” said Mistress Baby, whose superstitious feelings
had been daunted by the threats of the supposed sorceress, and who,
amidst her eager, narrow, and repining disposition, had, like all who
possess marked character, some sparks of higher feeling, which made her
sympathize with generous sentiments, though she thought it too expensive
to entertain them at her own cost—“He is a brave lad,” she again
repeated, “and worthy of ten geese, if I had them to boil for him, or
roast either. I’ll warrant him a gentleman’s son, and no churl’s blood.”</p>
<p>“Hear me, young Mordaunt,” said Norna, “and depart from this house. Fate
has high views on you—you shall not remain in this hovel to be crushed
amid its worthless ruins, with the relics of its more worthless
inhabitants, whose life is as little to the world as the vegetation of
the house-leek, which now grows on their thatch, and which shall soon be
crushed amongst their mangled limbs.”</p>
<p>“I—I—I will go forth,” said Yellowley, who, despite of his bearing
himself scholarly and wisely, was beginning to be terrified for the
issue of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> adventure; for the house was old, and the walls rocked
formidably to the blast.</p>
<p>“To what purpose?” said his sister. “I trust the Prince of the power of
the air has not yet such-like power over those that are made in God’s
image, that a good house should fall about our heads, because a randy
quean” (here she darted a fierce glance at the Pythoness) “should boast
us with her glamour, as if we were sae mony dogs to crouch at her
bidding!”</p>
<p>“I was only wanting,” said Triptolemus, ashamed of his motion, “to look
at the bear-braird, which must be sair laid wi’ this tempest; but if
this honest woman like to bide wi’ us, I think it were best to let us a’
sit doun canny thegither, till it’s working weather again.”</p>
<p>“Honest woman!” echoed Baby—“Foul warlock thief!—Aroint ye, ye
limmer!” she added, addressing Norna directly; “out of an honest house,
or, shame fa’ me, but I’ll take the bittle<a id="FNanchor_26_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_32">[26]</a> to you!”</p>
<p>Norna cast on her a look of supreme contempt; then, stepping to the
window, seemed engaged in deep contemplation of the heavens, while the
old maid-servant, Tronda, drawing close to her mistress, implored, for
the sake of all that was dear to man or woman, “Do not provoke Norna of
Fitful-head! You have no sic woman on the mainland of Scotland—she can
ride on one of these clouds as easily as man ever rode on a sheltie.”</p>
<p>“I shall live to see her ride on the reek of a fat tar-barrel,” said
Mistress Baby; “and that will be a fit pacing palfrey for her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Again Norna regarded the enraged Mrs. Baby Yellowley with a look of that
unutterable scorn which her haughty features could so well express, and
moving to the window which looked to the north-west, from which quarter
the gale seemed at present to blow, she stood for some time with her
arms crossed, looking out upon the leaden-coloured sky, obscured as it
was by the thick drift, which, coming on in successive gusts of tempest,
left ever and anon sad and dreary intervals of expectation betwixt the
dying and the reviving blast.</p>
<p>Norna regarded this war of the elements as one to whom their strife was
familiar; yet the stern serenity of her features had in it a cast of
awe, and at the same time of authority, as the cabalist may be supposed
to look upon the spirit he has evoked, and which, though he knows how to
subject him to his spell, bears still an aspect appalling to flesh and
blood. The attendants stood by in different attitudes, expressive of
their various feelings. Mordaunt, though not indifferent to the risk in
which they stood, was more curious than alarmed. He had heard of Norna’s
alleged power over the elements, and now expected an opportunity of
judging for himself of its reality. Triptolemus Yellowley was confounded
at what seemed to be far beyond the bounds of his philosophy; and, if
the truth must be spoken, the worthy agriculturist was greatly more
frightened than inquisitive. His sister was not in the least curious on
the subject; but it was difficult to say whether anger or fear
predominated in her sharp eyes and thin compressed lips. The pedlar and
old Tronda, confident that the house would never fall while the
redoubted Norna was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> beneath its roof, held themselves ready for a start
the instant she should take her departure.</p>
<p>Having looked on the sky for some time in a fixed attitude, and with the
most profound silence, Norna at once, yet with a slow and elevated
gesture, extended her staff of black oak towards that part of the
heavens from which the blast came hardest, and in the midst of its fury
chanted a Norwegian invocation, still preserved in the Island of Uist,
under the name of the Song of the Reimkennar, though some call it the
Song of the Tempest. The following is a free translation, it being
impossible to render literally many of the elliptical and metaphorical
terms of expression, peculiar to the ancient Northern poetry:—</p>
<h3>1.</h3>

</p>
<p>We have said that Mordaunt was naturally fond of romantic poetry and
romantic situation; it is not therefore surprising that he listened with
interest to the wild address thus uttered to the wildest wind of the
compass, in a tone of such dauntless enthusiasm. But though he had heard
so much of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> Runic rhyme and of the northern spell, in the country
where he had so long dwelt, he was not on this occasion so credulous as
to believe that the tempest, which had raged so lately, and which was
now beginning to decline, was subdued before the charmed verse of Norna.
Certain it was, that the blast seemed passing away, and the apprehended
danger was already over; but it was not improbable that this issue had
been for some time foreseen by the Pythoness, through signs of the
weather imperceptible to those who had not dwelt long in the country, or
had not bestowed on the meteorological phenomena the attention of a
strict and close observer. Of Norna’s experience he had no doubt, and
that went a far way to explain what seemed supernatural in her
demeanour. Yet still the noble countenance, half-shaded by dishevelled
tresses, the air of majesty with which, in a tone of menace as well as
of command, she addressed the viewless spirit of the tempest, gave him a
strong inclination to believe in the ascendency of the occult arts over
the powers of nature; for, if a woman ever moved on earth to whom such
authority over the ordinary laws of the universe could belong, Norna of
Fitful-head, judging from bearing, figure, and face, was born to that
high destiny.</p>
<p>The rest of the company were less slow in receiving conviction. To
Tronda and the jagger none was necessary; they had long believed in the
full extent of Norna’s authority over the elements. But Triptolemus and
his sister gazed at each other with wondering and alarmed looks,
especially when the wind began perceptibly to decline, as was remarkably
visible during the pauses which Norna made betwixt the strophes of her
incantation. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> long silence followed the last verse, until Norna
resumed her chant, but with a changed and more soothing modulation of
voice and tune.</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Eagle of the far north-western waters,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hast closed thy wide sails at her bidding,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And folded them in peace by thy side.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My blessing be on thy retiring path!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When thou stoopest from thy place on high,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft be thy slumbers in the caverns of the unknown ocean,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest till destiny shall again awaken thee;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eagle of the north-west, thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar!”</span><br>
</p>
<p>“A pretty sang that would be to keep the corn from shaking in har’st,”
whispered the agriculturist to his sister; “we must speak her fair,
Baby—she will maybe part with the secret for a hundred pund Scots.”</p>
<p>“An hundred fules’ heads!” replied Baby—“bid her five merks of ready
siller. I never knew a witch in my life but she was as poor as Job.”</p>
<p>Norna turned towards them as if she had guessed their thoughts; it may
be that she did so. She passed them with a look of the most sovereign
contempt, and walking to the table on which the preparations for Mrs.
Barbara’s frugal meal were already disposed, she filled a small wooden
quaigh from an earthen pitcher which contained bland, a subacid liquor
made out of the serous part of the milk. She broke a single morsel from
a barley-cake, and having eaten and drunk, returned towards the churlish
hosts. “I give you no thanks,” she said, “for my refreshment, for you
bid me not welcome to it; and thanks bestowed on a churl are like the
dew of heaven on the cliffs of Foulah, where it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> finds nought that can
be refreshed by its influences. I give you no thanks,” she said again,
but drawing from her pocket a leathern purse that seemed large and
heavy, she added, “I pay you with what you will value more than the
gratitude of the whole inhabitants of Hialtland. Say not that Norna of
Fitful-head hath eaten of your bread and drunk of your cup, and left you
sorrowing for the charge to which she hath put your house.” So saying,
she laid on the table a small piece of antique gold coin, bearing the
rude and half-defaced effigies of some ancient northern king.</p>
<p>Triptolemus and his sister exclaimed against this liberality with
vehemence; the first protesting that he kept no public, and the other
exclaiming, “Is the carline mad? Heard ye ever of ony of the gentle
house of Clinkscale that gave meat for siller?”</p>
<p>“Or for love either?” muttered her brother; “haud to that, tittie.”</p>
<p>“What are ye whittie-whattieing about, ye gowk?” said his gentle sister,
who suspected the tenor of his murmurs; “gie the ladie back her
bonnie-die there, and be blithe to be sae rid on’t—it will be a
sclate-stane the morn, if not something worse.”</p>
<p>The honest factor lifted the money to return it, yet could not help
being struck when he saw the impression, and his hand trembled as he
handed it to his sister.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the Pythoness again, as if she read the thoughts of the
astonished pair, “you have seen that coin before—beware how you use it!
It thrives not with the sordid or the mean-souled—it was won with
honourable danger, and must be expended with honourable liberality. The
treasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> which lies under a cold hearth will one day, like the hidden
talent, bear witness against its avaricious possessors.”</p>
<p>This last obscure intimation seemed to raise the alarm and the wonder of
Mrs. Baby and her brother to the uttermost. The latter tried to stammer
out something like an invitation to Norna to tarry with them all night,
or at least to take share of the “dinner,” so he at first called it; but
looking at the company, and remembering the limited contents of the pot,
he corrected the phrase, and hoped she would take some part of the
“snack, which would be on the table ere a man could loose a pleugh.”</p>
<p>“I eat not here—I sleep not here,” replied Norna—“nay, I relieve you
not only of my own presence, but I will dismiss your unwelcome
guests.—Mordaunt,” she added, addressing young Mertoun, “the dark fit
is past, and your father looks for you this evening.”</p>
<p>“Do you return in that direction?” said Mordaunt. “I will but eat a
morsel, and give you my aid, good mother, on the road. The brooks must
be out, and the journey perilous.”</p>
<p>“Our roads lie different,” answered the Sibyl, “and Norna needs not
mortal arm to aid her on the way. I am summoned far to the east, by
those who know well how to smooth my passage.—For thee, Bryce
Snailsfoot,” she continued, speaking to the pedlar, “speed thee on to
Sumburgh—the Roost will afford thee a gallant harvest, and worthy the
gathering in. Much goodly ware will ere now be seeking a new owner, and
the careful skipper will sleep still enough in the deep haaf, and care
not that bale and chest are dashing against the shores.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Na, na, good mother,” answered Snailsfoot, “I desire no man’s life for
my private advantage, and am just grateful for the blessing of
Providence on my sma’ trade. But doubtless one man’s loss is another’s
gain; and as these storms destroy a’ thing on land, it is but fair they
suld send us something by sea. Sae, taking the freedom, like yoursell,
mother, to borrow a lump of barley-bread, and a draught of bland, I will
bid good-day, and thank you, to this good gentleman and lady, and e’en
go on my way to Jarlshof, as you advise.”</p>
<p>“Ay,” replied the Pythoness, “where the slaughter is, the eagles will be
gathered; and where the wreck is on the shore, the jagger is as busy to
purchase spoil as the shark to gorge upon the dead.”</p>
<p>This rebuke, if it was intended for such, seemed above the comprehension
of the travelling merchant, who, bent upon gain, assumed the knapsack
and ellwand, and asked Mordaunt, with the familiarity permitted in a
wild country, whether he would not take company along with him?</p>
<p>“I wait to eat some dinner with Mr. Yellowley and Mrs. Baby,” answered
the youth, “and will set forward in half an hour.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll just take my piece in my hand,” said the pedlar. Accordingly
he muttered a benediction, and, without more ceremony, helped himself to
what, in Mrs. Baby’s covetous eyes, appeared to be two-thirds of the
bread, took a long pull at the jug of bland, seized on a handful of the
small fish called sillocks, which the domestic was just placing on the
board, and left the room without farther ceremony.</p>
<p>“My certie,” said the despoiled Mrs. Baby, “there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> is the chapman’s
drouth<a id="FNanchor_27_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_33">[27]</a> and his hunger baith, as folk say! If the laws against
vagrants be executed this gate—It’s no that I wad shut the door against
decent folk,” she said, looking to Mordaunt, “more especially in such
judgment-weather. But I see the goose is dished, poor thing.”</p>
<p>This she spoke in a tone of affection for the smoked goose, which,
though it had long been an inanimate inhabitant of her chimney, was far
more interesting to Mrs. Baby in that state, than when it screamed
amongst the clouds. Mordaunt laughed and took his seat, then turned to
look for Norna; but she had glided from the apartment during the
discussion with the pedlar.</p>
<p>“I am glad she is gane, the dour carline,” said Mrs. Baby, “though she
has left that piece of gowd to be an everlasting shame to us.”</p>
<p>“Whisht, mistress, for the love of heaven!” said Tronda Dronsdaughter;
“wha kens where she may be this moment?—we are no sure but she may hear
us, though we cannot see her.”</p>
<p>Mistress Baby cast a startled eye around, and instantly recovering
herself, for she was naturally courageous as well as violent, said, “I
bade her aroint before, and I bid her aroint again, whether she sees me
or hears me, or whether she’s ower the cairn and awa.—And you, ye silly
sumph,” she said to poor Yellowley, “what do ye stand glowering there
for?—<i>You</i> a Saunt Andrew’s student!—<i>you</i> studied lair and Latin
humanities, as ye ca’ them, and daunted wi’ the clavers of an auld
randie wife!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Say your best college grace, man, and witch, or nae witch,
we’ll eat our dinner, and defy her. And for the value of the gowden
piece, it shall never be said I pouched her siller. I will gie it to
some poor body—that is, I will test<a id="FNanchor_28_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_34">[28]</a> upon it at my death, and keep
it for a purse-penny till that day comes, and that’s no using it in the
way of spending siller. Say your best college grace, man, and let us eat
and drink in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“Ye had muckle better say an <i>oraamus</i> to Saint Ronald, and fling a
saxpence ower your left shouther, master,” said Tronda.<a id="FNanchor_29_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_35">[29]</a></p>
<p>“That ye may pick it up, ye jaud,” said the implacable Mistress Baby;
“it will be lang or ye win the worth of it ony other gate.—Sit down,
Triptolemus, and mindna the words of a daft wife.”</p>
<p>“Daft or wise,” replied Yellowley, very much disconcerted, “she kens
more than I would wish she kend. It was awfu’ to see sic a wind fa’ at
the voice of flesh and blood like oursells—and then yon about the
hearth-stane—I cannot but think”——</p>
<p>“If ye cannot but think,” said Mrs. Baby, very sharply, “at least ye can
haud your tongue?”</p>
<p>The agriculturist made no reply, but sate down to their scanty meal, and
did the honours of it with unusual heartiness to his new guest, the
first of the intruders who had arrived, and the last who left them. The
sillocks speedily disappeared, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> smoked goose, with its
appendages, took wing so effectually, that Tronda, to whom the polishing
of the bones had been destined, found the task accomplished, or nearly
so, to her hand. After dinner, the host produced his bottle of brandy;
but Mordaunt, whose general habits were as abstinent almost as those of
his father, laid a very light tax upon this unusual exertion of
hospitality.</p>
<p>During the meal, they learned so much of young Mordaunt, and of his
father, that even Baby resisted his wish to reassume his wet garments,
and pressed him (at the risk of an expensive supper being added to the
charges of the day) to tarry with them till the next morning. But what
Norna had said excited the youth’s wish to reach home, nor, however far
the hospitality of Stourburgh was extended in his behalf, did the house
present any particular temptations to induce him to remain there longer.
He therefore accepted the loan of the factor’s clothes, promising to
return them, and send for his own; and took a civil leave of his host
and Mistress Baby, the latter of whom, however affected by the loss of
her goose, could not but think the cost well bestowed (since it was to
be expended at all) upon so handsome and cheerful a youth.</p>

</p>
<p>There were ten “lang Scots miles” betwixt Stourburgh and Jarlshof; and
though the pedestrian did not number all the impediments which crossed
Tam o’ Shanter’s path,—for in a country where there are neither hedges
nor stone enclosures, there can be neither “slaps nor stiles,”—yet the
number and nature of the “mosses and waters” which he had to cross in
his peregrination, was fully sufficient to balance the account, and to
render his journey as toilsome and dangerous as Tam o’ Shanter’s
celebrated retreat from Ayr. Neither witch nor warlock crossed
Mordaunt’s path, however. The length of the day was already
considerable, and he arrived safe at Jarlshof by eleven o’clock at
night. All was still and dark round the mansion, and it was not till he
had whistled twice or thrice beneath Swertha’s window, that she replied
to the signal.</p>
<p>At the first sound, Swertha fell into an agreeable dream of a young
whale-fisher, who some forty years before used to make such a signal
beneath the window of her hut; at the second, she waked to remember that
Johnnie Fea had slept sound among the frozen waves of Greenland for this
many a year, and that she was Mr. Mertoun’s governante at Jarlshof; at
the third, she arose and opened the window.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>“Whae is that,” she demanded, “at sic an hour of the night?”</p>
<p>“It is I,” said the youth.</p>
<p>“And what for comena ye in? The door’s on the latch, and there is a
gathering peat on the kitchen fire, and a spunk beside it—ye can light
your ain candle.”</p>
<p>“All well,” replied Mordaunt; “but I want to know how my father is?”</p>
<p>“Just in his ordinary, gude gentleman—asking for you, Maister Mordaunt;
ye are ower far and ower late in your walks, young gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Then the dark hour has passed, Swertha?”</p>
<p>“In troth has it, Maister Mordaunt,” answered the governante; “and your
father is very reasonably good-natured for him, poor gentleman. I spake
to him twice yesterday without his speaking first; and the first time he
answered me as civil as you could do, and the neist time he bade me no
plague him; and then, thought I, three times were aye canny, so I spake
to him again for luck’s-sake, and he called me a chattering old devil;
but it was quite and clean in a civil sort of way.”</p>
<p>“Enough, enough, Swertha,” answered Mordaunt; “and now get up, and find
me something to eat, for I have dined but poorly.”</p>
<p>“Then you have been at the new folk’s at Stourburgh; for there is no
another house in a’ the Isles but they wad hae gi’en ye the best share
of the best they had. Saw ye aught of Norna of the Fitful-head? She went
to Stourburgh this morning, and returned to the town at night.”</p>
<p>“Returned!—then she is here? How could she travel three leagues and
better in so short a time?”</p>
<p>“Wha kens how she travels?” replied Swertha;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> “but I heard her tell the
Ranzelman wi’ my ain lugs, that she intended that day to have gone on to
Burgh-Westra, to speak with Minna Troil, but she had seen that at
Stourburgh, (indeed she said at Harfra, for she never calls it by the
other name of Stourburgh,) that sent her back to our town. But gang your
ways round, and ye shall have plenty of supper—ours is nae toom pantry,
and still less a locked ane, though my master be a stranger, and no just
that tight in the upper rigging, as the Ranzelman says.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt walked round to the kitchen accordingly, where Swertha’s care
speedily accommodated him with a plentiful, though coarse meal, which
indemnified him for the scanty hospitality he had experienced at
Stourburgh.</p>
<p>In the morning, some feelings of fatigue made young Mertoun later than
usual in leaving his bed; so that, contrary to what was the ordinary
case, he found his father in the apartment where they eat, and which
served them indeed for every common purpose, save that of a bedchamber
or of a kitchen. The son greeted the father in mute reverence, and
waited until he should address him.</p>
<p>“You were absent yesterday, Mordaunt?” said his father. Mordaunt’s
absence had lasted a week and more; but he had often observed that his
father never seemed to notice how time passed during the period when he
was affected with his sullen vapours. He assented to what the elder Mr.
Mertoun had said.</p>
<p>“And you were at Burgh-Westra, as I think?” continued his father.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Mordaunt.</p>
<p>The elder Mertoun was then silent for some time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> and paced the floor in
deep silence, with an air of sombre reflection, which seemed as if he
were about to relapse into his moody fit. Suddenly turning to his son,
however, he observed, in the tone of a query, “Magnus Troil has two
daughters—they must be now young women; they are thought handsome, of
course?”</p>
<p>“Very generally, sir,” answered Mordaunt, rather surprised to hear his
father making any enquiries about the individuals of a sex which he
usually thought so light of, a surprise which was much increased by the
next question, put as abruptly as the former.</p>
<p>“Which think you the handsomest?”</p>
<p>“I, sir?” replied his son with some wonder, but without
embarrassment—“I really am no judge—I never considered which was
absolutely the handsomest. They are both very pretty young women.”</p>
<p>“You evade my question, Mordaunt; perhaps I have some very particular
reason for my wish to be acquainted with your taste in this matter. I am
not used to waste words for no purpose. I ask you again, which of Magnus
Troil’s daughters you think most handsome?”</p>
<p>“Really, sir,” replied Mordaunt—“but you only jest in asking me such a
question.”</p>
<p>“Young man,” replied Mertoun, with eyes which began to roll and sparkle
with impatience, “I <i>never</i> jest. I desire an answer to my question.”</p>
<p>“Then, upon my word, sir,” said Mordaunt, “it is not in my power to form
a judgment betwixt the young ladies—they are both very pretty, but by
no means like each other. Minna is dark-haired, and more grave than her
sister—more serious, but by no means either dull or sullen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Um,” replied his father; “you have been gravely brought up, and this
Minna, I suppose, pleases you most?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, really I can give her no preference over her sister Brenda,
who is as gay as a lamb in a spring morning—less tall than her sister,
but so well formed, and so excellent a dancer”——</p>
<p>“That she is best qualified to amuse the young man, who has a dull home
and a moody father?” said Mr. Mertoun.</p>
<p>Nothing in his father’s conduct had ever surprised Mordaunt so much as
the obstinacy with which he seemed to pursue a theme so foreign to his
general train of thought, and habits of conversation; but he contented
himself with answering once more, “that both the young ladies were
highly admirable, but he had never thought of them with the wish to do
either injustice, by ranking her lower than her sister—that others
would probably decide between them, as they happened to be partial to a
grave or a gay disposition, or to a dark or fair complexion; but that he
could see no excellent quality in the one that was not balanced by
something equally captivating in the other.”</p>
<p>It is possible that even the coolness with which Mordaunt made this
explanation might not have satisfied his father concerning the subject
of investigation; but Swertha at this moment entered with breakfast, and
the youth, notwithstanding his late supper, engaged in that meal with an
air which satisfied Mertoun that he held it matter of more grave
importance than the conversation which they had just had, and that he
had nothing more to say upon the subject explanatory of the answers he
had already given. He shaded his brow with his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and looked long
fixedly upon the young man as he was busied with his morning meal. There
was neither abstraction nor a sense of being observed in any of his
motions; all was frank, natural, and open.</p>
<p>“He is fancy-free,” muttered Mertoun to himself—“so young, so lively,
and so imaginative, so handsome and so attractive in face and person,
strange, that at his age, and in his circumstances, he should have
avoided the meshes which catch all the world beside!”</p>
<p>When the breakfast was over, the elder Mertoun, instead of proposing, as
usual, that his son, who awaited his commands, should betake himself to
one branch or other of his studies, assumed his hat and staff, and
desired that Mordaunt should accompany him to the top of the cliff,
called Sumburgh-head, and from thence look out upon the state of the
ocean, agitated as it must still be by the tempest of the preceding day.
Mordaunt was at the age when young men willingly exchange sedentary
pursuits for active exercise, and started up with alacrity to comply
with his father’s desire; and in the course of a few minutes they were
mounting together the hill, which, ascending from the land side in a
long, steep, and grassy slope, sinks at once from the summit to the sea
in an abrupt and tremendous precipice.</p>
<p>The day was delightful; there was just so much motion in the air as to
disturb the little fleecy clouds which were scattered on the horizon,
and by floating them occasionally over the sun, to chequer the landscape
with that variety of light and shade which often gives to a bare and
unenclosed scene, for the time at least, a species of charm approaching
to the varieties of a cultivated and planted country. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> thousand
flitting hues of light and shade played over the expanse of wild moor,
rocks, and inlets, which, as they climbed higher and higher, spread in
wide and wider circuit around them.</p>
<p>The elder Mertoun often paused and looked round upon the scene, and for
some time his son supposed that he halted to enjoy its beauties; but as
they ascended still higher up the hill, he remarked his shortened breath
and his uncertain and toilsome step, and became assured, with some
feelings of alarm, that his father’s strength was, for the moment,
exhausted, and that he found the ascent more toilsome and fatiguing than
usual. To draw close to his side, and offer him in silence the
assistance of his arm, was an act of youthful deference to advanced age,
as well as of filial reverence; and Mertoun seemed at first so to
receive it, for he took in silence the advantage of the aid thus
afforded him.</p>
<p>It was but for two or three minutes, however, that the father availed
himself of his son’s support. They had not ascended fifty yards farther,
ere he pushed Mordaunt suddenly, if not rudely, from him; and, as if
stung into exertion by some sudden recollection, began to mount the
acclivity with such long and quick steps, that Mordaunt, in his turn,
was obliged to exert himself to keep pace with him. He knew his father’s
peculiarity of disposition; he was aware from many slight circumstances,
that he loved him not even while he took much pains with his education,
and while he seemed to be the sole object of his care upon earth. But
the conviction had never been more strongly or more powerfully forced
upon him than by the hasty churlishness with which Mertoun rejected from
a son that assistance, which most elderly men are willing to receive
from youths with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> whom they are but slightly connected, as a tribute
which it is alike graceful to yield and pleasing to receive. Mertoun,
however, did not seem to perceive the effect which his unkindness had
produced upon his son’s feelings. He paused upon a sort of level terrace
which they had now attained, and addressed his son with an indifferent
tone, which seemed in some degree affected.</p>
<p>“Since you have so few inducements, Mordaunt, to remain in these wild
islands, I suppose you sometimes wish to look a little more abroad into
the world?”</p>
<p>“By my word, sir,” replied Mordaunt, “I cannot say I ever have a thought
on such a subject.”</p>
<p>“And why not, young man?” demanded his father; “it were but natural, I
think, at your age. At your age, the fair and varied breadth of Britain
could not gratify me, much less the compass of a sea-girdled peat-moss.”</p>
<p>“I have never thought of leaving Zetland, sir,” replied the son. “I am
happy here, and have friends. You yourself, sir, would miss me, unless
indeed”——</p>
<p>“Why, thou wouldst not persuade me,” said his father, somewhat hastily,
“that you stay here, or desire to stay here, for the love of me?”</p>
<p>“Why should I not, sir?” answered Mordaunt, mildly; “it is my duty, and
I hope I have hitherto performed it.”</p>
<p>“O ay,” repeated Mertoun, in the same tone—“your duty—your duty. So it
is the duty of the dog to follow the groom that feeds him.”</p>
<p>“And does he not do so, sir?” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Ay,” said his father, turning his head aside: “but he fawns only on
those who caress him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I hope, sir,” replied Mordaunt, “I have not been found deficient?”</p>
<p>“Say no more on’t—say no more on’t,” said Mertoun, abruptly, “we have
both done enough by each other—we must soon part—Let that be our
comfort—if our separation should require comfort.”</p>
<p>“I shall be ready to obey your wishes,” said Mordaunt, not altogether
displeased at what promised him an opportunity of looking farther abroad
into the world. “I presume it will be your pleasure that I commence my
travels with a season at the whale-fishing.”</p>
<p>“Whale-fishing!” replied Mertoun; “that were a mode indeed of seeing the
world! but thou speakest but as thou hast learned. Enough of this for
the present. Tell me where you had shelter from the storm yesterday?”</p>
<p>“At Stourburgh, the house of the new factor from Scotland.”</p>
<p>“A pedantic, fantastic, visionary schemer,” said Mertoun—“and whom saw
you there?”</p>
<p>“His sister, sir,” replied Mordaunt, “and old Norna of the Fitful-head.”</p>
<p>“What! the mistress of the potent spell,” answered Mertoun, with a
sneer—“she who can change the wind by pulling her curch on one side, as
King Erick used to do by turning his cap? The dame journeys far from
home—how fares she? Does she get rich by selling favourable winds to
those who are port-bound?”<a id="FNanchor_30_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_36">[30]</a></p>
<p>“I really do not know, sir,” said Mordaunt, whom certain recollections
prevented from freely entering into his father’s humour.</p>
<p>“You think the matter too serious to be jested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> with, or perhaps esteem
her merchandise too light to be cared after,” continued Mertoun, in the
same sarcastic tone, which was the nearest approach he ever made to
cheerfulness; “but consider it more deeply. Every thing in the universe
is bought and sold, and why not wind, if the merchant can find
purchasers? The earth is rented, from its surface down to its most
central mines;—the fire, and the means of feeding it, are currently
bought and sold;—the wretches that sweep the boisterous ocean with
their nets, pay ransom for the privilege of being drowned in it. What
title has the air to be exempted from the universal course of traffic?
All above the earth, under the earth, and around the earth, has its
price, its sellers, and its purchasers. In many countries the priests
will sell you a portion of heaven—in all countries men are willing to
buy, in exchange for health, wealth, and peace of conscience, a full
allowance of hell. Why should not Norna pursue her traffic?”</p>
<p>“Nay, I know no reason against it,” replied Mordaunt; “only I wish she
would part with the commodity in smaller quantities. Yesterday she was a
wholesale dealer—whoever treated with her had too good a pennyworth.”</p>
<p>“It is even so,” said his father, pausing on the verge of the wild
promontory which they had attained, where the huge precipice sinks
abruptly down on the wide and tempestuous ocean, “and the effects are
still visible.”</p>
<p>The face of that lofty cape is composed of the soft and crumbling stone
called sand-flag, which gradually becomes decomposed, and yields to the
action of the atmosphere, and is split into large masses, that hang
loose upon the verge of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> precipice, and, detached from it by the
violence of the tempests, often descend with great fury into the vexed
abyss which lashes the foot of the rock. Numbers of these huge fragments
lie strewed beneath the rocks from which they have fallen, and amongst
these the tide foams and rages with a fury peculiar to those latitudes.</p>
<p>At the period when Mertoun and his son looked from the verge of the
precipice, the wide sea still heaved and swelled with the agitation of
yesterday’s storm, which had been far too violent in its effects on the
ocean to subside speedily. The tide therefore poured on the headland
with a fury deafening to the ear, and dizzying to the eye, threatening
instant destruction to whatever might be at the time involved in its
current. The sight of Nature, in her magnificence, or in her beauty, or
in her terrors, has at all times an overpowering interest, which even
habit cannot greatly weaken; and both father and son sat themselves down
on the cliff to look out upon that unbounded war of waters, which rolled
in their wrath to the foot of the precipice.</p>
<p>At once Mordaunt, whose eyes were sharper, and probably his attention
more alert, than that of his father, started up, and exclaimed, “God in
Heaven! there is a vessel in the Roost!”</p>
<p>Mertoun looked to the north-westward, and an object was visible amid the
rolling tide. “She shows no sail,” he observed; and immediately added,
after looking at the object through his spy-glass, “She is dismasted,
and lies a sheer hulk upon the water.”</p>
<p>“And is drifting on the Sumburgh-head,” exclaimed Mordaunt, struck with
horror, “without the slightest means of weathering the cape!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“She makes no effort,” answered his father; “she is probably deserted by
her crew.”</p>
<p>“And in such a day as yesterday,” replied Mordaunt, “when no open boat
could live were she manned with the best men ever handled an oar—all
must have perished.”</p>
<p>“It is most probable,” said his father, with stern composure; “and one
day, sooner or later, all must have perished. What signifies whether the
fowler, whom nothing escapes, caught them up at one swoop from yonder
shattered deck, or whether he clutched them individually, as chance gave
them to his grasp? What signifies it?—the deck, the battlefield, are
scarce more fatal to us than our table and our bed; and we are saved
from the one, merely to drag out a heartless and wearisome existence,
till we perish at the other. Would the hour were come—that hour which
reason would teach us to wish for, were it not that nature has implanted
the fear of it so strongly within us! You wonder at such a reflection,
because life is yet new to you. Ere you have attained my age, it will be
the familiar companion of your thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Surely, sir,” replied Mordaunt, “such distaste to life is not the
necessary consequence of advanced age?”</p>
<p>“To all who have sense to estimate that which it is really worth,” said
Mertoun. “Those who, like Magnus Troil, possess so much of the animal
impulses about them, as to derive pleasure from sensual gratification,
may perhaps, like the animals, feel pleasure in mere existence.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt liked neither the doctrine nor the example. He thought a man
who discharged his duties towards others as well as the good old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Udaller, had a better right to have the sun shine fair on his setting,
than that which he might derive from mere insensibility. But he let the
subject drop; for to dispute with his father, had always the effect of
irritating him; and again he adverted to the condition of the wreck.</p>
<p>The hulk, for it was little better, was now in the very midst of the
current, and drifting at a great rate towards the foot of the precipice,
upon whose verge they were placed. Yet it was a long while ere they had
a distinct view of the object which they had at first seen as a black
speck amongst the waters, and then, at a nearer distance, like a whale,
which now scarce shows its back-fin above the waves, now throws to view
its large black side. Now, however, they could more distinctly observe
the appearance of the ship, for the huge swelling waves which bore her
forward to the shore, heaved her alternately high upon the surface, and
then plunged her into the trough or furrow of the sea. She seemed a
vessel of two or three hundred tons, fitted up for defence, for they
could see her port-holes. She had been dismasted probably in the gale of
the preceding day, and lay water-logged on the waves, a prey to their
violence. It appeared certain, that the crew, finding themselves unable
either to direct the vessel’s course, or to relieve her by pumping, had
taken to their boats, and left her to her fate. All apprehensions were
therefore unnecessary, so far as the immediate loss of human lives was
concerned; and yet it was not without a feeling of breathless awe that
Mordaunt and his father beheld the vessel—that rare masterpiece by
which human genius aspires to surmount the waves, and contend with the
winds, upon the point of falling a prey to them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>Onward she came, the large black hulk seeming larger at every fathom’s
length. She came nearer, until she bestrode the summit of one tremendous
billow, which rolled on with her unbroken, till the wave and its burden
were precipitated against the rock, and then the triumph of the elements
over the work of human hands was at once completed. One wave, we have
said, made the wrecked vessel completely manifest in her whole bulk, as
it raised her, and bore her onward against the face of the precipice.
But when that wave receded from the foot of the rock, the ship had
ceased to exist; and the retiring billow only bore back a quantity of
beams, planks, casks, and similar objects, which swept out to the
offing, to be brought in again by the next wave, and again precipitated
upon the face of the rock.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Mordaunt conceived he saw a man floating on a
plank or water-cask, which, drifting away from the main current, seemed
about to go ashore upon a small spot of sand, where the water was
shallow, and the waves broke more smoothly. To see the danger, and to
exclaim, “He lives, and may yet be saved!” was the first impulse of the
fearless Mordaunt. The next was, after one rapid glance at the front of
the cliff, to precipitate himself—such seemed the rapidity of his
movement—from the verge, and to commence, by means of slight fissures,
projections, and crevices in the rock, a descent, which, to a spectator,
appeared little else than an act of absolute insanity.</p>
<p>“Stop, I command you, rash boy!” said his father; “the attempt is death.
Stop, and take the safer path to the left.” But Mordaunt was already
completely engaged in his perilous enterprise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why should I prevent him?” said his father, checking his anxiety with
the stern and unfeeling philosophy whose principles he had adopted.
“Should he die now, full of generous and high feeling, eager in the
cause of humanity, happy in the exertion of his own conscious activity,
and youthful strength—should he die now, will he not escape
misanthropy, and remorse, and age, and the consciousness of decaying
powers, both of body and mind?—I will not look upon it however—I will
not—I cannot behold his young light so suddenly quenched.”</p>
<p>He turned from the precipice accordingly, and hastening to the left for
more than a quarter of a mile, he proceeded towards a <i>riva</i>, or cleft
in the rock, containing a path, called Erick’s Steps, neither safe,
indeed, nor easy, but the only one by which the inhabitants of Jarlshof
were wont, for any purpose, to seek access to the foot of the precipice.</p>
<p>But long ere Mertoun had reached even the upper end of the pass, his
adventurous and active son had accomplished his more desperate
enterprise. He had been in vain turned aside from the direct line of
descent, by the intervention of difficulties which he had not seen from
above—his route became only more circuitous, but could not be
interrupted. More than once, large fragments to which he was about to
intrust his weight, gave way before him, and thundered down into the
tormented ocean; and in one or two instances, such detached pieces of
rock rushed after him, as if to bear him headlong in their course. A
courageous heart, a steady eye, a tenacious hand, and a firm foot,
carried him through his desperate attempt; and in the space of seven
minutes, he stood at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> cliff, from the verge of which
he had achieved his perilous descent.</p>
<p>The place which he now occupied was the small projecting spot of stones,
sand, and gravel, that extended a little way into the sea, which on the
right hand lashed the very bottom of the precipice, and on the left, was
scarce divided from it by a small wave-worn portion of beach that
extended as far as the foot of the rent in the rocks called Erick’s
Steps, by which Mordaunt’s father proposed to descend.</p>
<p>When the vessel split and went to pieces, all was swallowed up in the
ocean, which had, after the first shock, been seen to float upon the
waves, excepting only a few pieces of wreck, casks, chests, and the
like, which a strong eddy, formed by the reflux of the waves, had
landed, or at least grounded, upon the shallow where Mordaunt now stood.
Amongst these, his eager eye discovered the object that had at first
engaged his attention, and which now, seen at nigher distance, proved to
be in truth a man, and in a most precarious state. His arms were still
wrapt with a close and convulsive grasp round the plank to which he had
clung in the moment of the shock, but sense and the power of motion were
fled; and, from the situation in which the plank lay, partly grounded
upon the beach, partly floating in the sea, there was every chance that
it might be again washed off shore, in which case death was inevitable.
Just as he had made himself aware of these circumstances, Mordaunt
beheld a huge wave advancing, and hastened to interpose his aid ere it
burst, aware that the reflux might probably sweep away the sufferer.</p>
<p>He rushed into the surf, and fastened on the body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> with the same
tenacity, though under a different impulse, with that wherewith the
hound seizes his prey. The strength of the retiring wave proved even
greater than he had expected, and it was not without a struggle for his
own life, as well as for that of the stranger, that Mordaunt resisted
being swept off with the receding billow, when, though an adroit
swimmer, the strength of the tide must either have dashed him against
the rocks, or hurried him out to sea. He stood his ground, however, and
ere another such billow had returned, he drew up, upon the small slip of
dry sand, both the body of the stranger, and the plank to which he
continued firmly attached. But how to save and to recall the means of
ebbing life and strength, and how to remove into a place of greater
safety the sufferer, who was incapable of giving any assistance towards
his own preservation, were questions which Mordaunt asked himself
eagerly, but in vain.</p>
<p>He looked to the summit of the cliff on which he had left his father,
and shouted to him for his assistance; but his eye could not distinguish
his form, and his voice was only answered by the scream of the
sea-birds. He gazed again on the sufferer. A dress richly laced,
according to the fashion of the times, fine linen, and rings upon his
fingers, evinced he was a man of superior rank; and his features showed
youth and comeliness, notwithstanding they were pallid and disfigured.
He still breathed, but so feebly, that his respiration was almost
imperceptible, and life seemed to keep such slight hold of his frame,
that there was every reason to fear it would become altogether
extinguished, unless it were speedily reinforced. To loosen the
handkerchief from his neck, to raise him with his face towards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
breeze, to support him with his arms, was all that Mordaunt could do for
his assistance, whilst he anxiously looked for some one who might lend
his aid in dragging the unfortunate to a more safe situation.</p>
<p>At this moment he beheld a man advancing slowly and cautiously along the
beach. He was in hopes, at first, it was his father, but instantly
recollected that he had not had time to come round by the circuitous
descent, to which he must necessarily have recourse, and besides, he saw
that the man who approached him was shorter in stature.</p>
<p>As he came nearer, Mordaunt was at no loss to recognise the pedlar whom
the day before he had met with at Harfra, and who was known to him
before upon many occasions. He shouted as loud as he could, “Bryce,
hollo! Bryce, come hither!” But the merchant, intent upon picking up
some of the spoils of the wreck, and upon dragging them out of reach of
the tide, paid for some time little attention to his shouts.</p>
<p>When he did at length approach Mordaunt, it was not to lend him his aid,
but to remonstrate with him on his rashness in undertaking the
charitable office. “Are you mad?” said he; “you that have lived sae lang
in Zetland, to risk the saving of a drowning man? Wot ye not, if you
bring him to life again, he will be sure to do you some capital
injury?<a id="FNanchor_31_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_37">[31]</a>—Come, Master Mordaunt, bear a hand to what’s mair to the
purpose. Help me to get ane or twa of these kists ashore before any body
else comes, and we shall share, like good Christians, what God sends us,
and be thankful.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt was indeed no stranger to this inhuman superstition, current at
a former period among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> lower orders of the Zetlanders, and the more
generally adopted, perhaps, that it served as an apology for refusing
assistance to the unfortunate victims of shipwreck, while they made
plunder of their goods. At any rate, the opinion, that to save a
drowning man was to run the risk of future injury from him, formed a
strange contradiction in the character of these islanders; who,
hospitable, generous, and disinterested, on all other occasions, were
sometimes, nevertheless, induced by this superstition, to refuse their
aid in those mortal emergencies, which were so common upon their rocky
and stormy coasts. We are happy to add, that the exhortation and example
of the proprietors have eradicated even the traces of this inhuman
belief, of which there might be some observed within the memory of those
now alive. It is strange that the minds of men should have ever been
hardened towards those involved in a distress to which they themselves
were so constantly exposed; but perhaps the frequent sight and
consciousness of such danger tends to blunt the feelings to its
consequences, whether affecting ourselves or others.</p>
<p>Bryce was remarkably tenacious of this ancient belief; the more so,
perhaps, that the mounting of his pack depended less upon the warehouses
of Lerwick or Kirkwall, than on the consequences of such a north-western
gale as that of the day preceding; for which (being a man who, in his
own way, professed great devotion) he seldom failed to express his
grateful thanks to Heaven. It was indeed said of him, that if he had
spent the same time in assisting the wrecked seamen, which he had
employed in rifling their bales and boxes, he would have saved many
lives, and lost much linen. He paid no sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> of attention to the
repeated entreaties of Mordaunt, although he was now upon the same slip
of sand with him. It was well known to Bryce as a place on which the
eddy was likely to land such spoils as the ocean disgorged; and to
improve the favourable moment, he occupied himself exclusively in
securing and appropriating whatever seemed most portable and of greatest
value. At length Mordaunt saw the honest pedlar fix his views upon a
strong sea-chest, framed of some Indian wood, well secured by brass
plates, and seeming to be of a foreign construction. The stout lock
resisted all Bryce’s efforts to open it, until, with great composure, he
plucked from his pocket a very neat hammer and chisel, and began forcing
the hinges.</p>
<p>Incensed beyond patience at his assurance, Mordaunt caught up a wooden
stretcher which lay near him, and laying his charge softly on the sand,
approached Bryce with a menacing gesture, and exclaimed, “You
cold-blooded, inhuman rascal! either get up instantly and lend me your
assistance to recover this man, and bear him out of danger from the
surf, or I will not only beat you to a mummy on the spot, but inform
Magnus Troil of your thievery, that he may have you flogged till your
bones are bare, and then banish you from the Mainland!”</p>
<p>The lid of the chest had just sprung open as this rough address saluted
Bryce’s ears, and the inside presented a tempting view of wearing
apparel for sea and land; shirts, plain and with lace ruffles, a silver
compass, a silver-hilted sword, and other valuable articles, which the
pedlar well knew to be such as stir in the trade. He was half-disposed
to start up, draw the sword, which was a cut-and-thrust, and “darraign
battaile,” as Spenser says, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> quit his prize, or brook
interruption. Being, though short, a stout square-made personage, and
not much past the prime of life, having besides the better weapon, he
might have given Mordaunt more trouble than his benevolent
knight-errantry deserved.</p>
<p>Already, as with vehemence he repeated his injunctions that Bryce should
forbear his plunder, and come to the assistance of the dying man, the
pedlar retorted with a voice of defiance, “Dinna swear, sir; dinna
swear, sir—I will endure no swearing in my presence; and if you lay a
finger on me, that am taking the lawful spoil of the Egyptians, I will
give ye a lesson ye shall remember from this day to Yule!”</p>
<p>Mordaunt would speedily have put the pedlar’s courage to the test, but a
voice behind him suddenly said, “Forbear!” It was the voice of Norna of
the Fitful-head, who, during the heat of their altercation, had
approached them unobserved. “Forbear!” she repeated; “and, Bryce, do
thou render Mordaunt the assistance he requires. It shall avail thee
more, and it is I who say the word, than all that you could earn to-day
besides.”</p>
<p>“It is se’enteen hundred linen,” said the pedlar, giving a tweak to one
of the shirts, in that knowing manner with which matrons and judges
ascertain the texture of the loom;—“it’s se’enteen hundred linen, and
as strong as an it were dowlas. Nevertheless, mother, your bidding is to
be done; and I would have done Mr. Mordaunt’s bidding too,” he added,
relaxing from his note of defiance into the deferential whining tone
with which he cajoled his customers, “if he hadna made use of profane
oaths, which made my very flesh grew, and caused me, in some sort, to
forget myself.” He then took a flask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> from his pocket, and approached
the shipwrecked man. “It’s the best of brandy,” he said; “and if that
doesna cure him, I ken nought that will.” So saying, he took a
preliminary gulp himself, as if to show the quality of the liquor, and
was about to put it to the man’s mouth, when, suddenly withholding his
hand, he looked at Norna—“You ensure me against all risk of evil from
him, if I am to render him my help?—Ye ken yoursell what folk say,
mother.”</p>
<p>For all other answer, Norna took the bottle from the pedlar’s hand, and
began to chafe the temples and throat of the shipwrecked man; directing
Mordaunt how to hold his head, so as to afford him the means of
disgorging the sea-water which he had swallowed during his immersion.</p>
<p>The pedlar looked on inactive for a moment, and then said, “To be sure,
there is not the same risk in helping him, now he is out of the water,
and lying high and dry on the beach; and, to be sure, the principal
danger is to those that first touch him; and, to be sure, it is a
world’s pity to see how these rings are pinching the puir creature’s
swalled fingers—they make his hand as blue as a partan’s back before
boiling.” So saying, he seized one of the man’s cold hands, which had
just, by a tremulous motion, indicated the return of life, and began his
charitable work of removing the rings, which seemed to be of some value.</p>
<p>“As you love your life, forbear,” said Norna, sternly, “or I will lay
that on you which shall spoil your travels through the isles.”</p>
<p>“Now, for mercy’s sake, mother, say nae mair about it,” said the pedlar,
“and I’ll e’en do your pleasure in your ain way! I <i>did</i> feel a
rheumatize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> in my back-spauld yestreen; and it wad be a sair thing for
the like of me to be debarred my quiet walk round the country, in the
way of trade—making the honest penny, and helping myself with what
Providence sends on our coasts.”</p>
<p>“Peace, then,” said the woman—“Peace, as thou wouldst not rue it; and
take this man on thy broad shoulders. His life is of value, and you will
be rewarded.”</p>
<p>“I had muckle need,” said the pedlar, pensively looking at the lidless
chest, and the other matters which strewed the sand; “for he has come
between me and as muckle spreacherie as wad hae made a man of me for the
rest of my life; and now it maun lie here till the next tide sweep it a’
doun the Roost, after them that aught it yesterday morning.”</p>
<p>“Fear not,” said Norna, “it will come to man’s use. See, there come
carrion-crows, of scent as keen as thine own.”</p>
<p>She spoke truly; for several of the people from the hamlet of Jarlshof
were now hastening along the beach, to have their share in the spoil.
The pedlar beheld them approach with a deep groan. “Ay, ay,” he said,
“the folk of Jarlshof, they will make clean wark; they are kend for that
far and wide; they winna leave the value of a rotten ratlin; and what’s
waur, there isna ane o’ them has mense or sense eneugh to give thanks
for the mercies when they have gotten them. There is the auld Ranzelman,
Neil Ronaldson, that canna walk a mile to hear the minister, but he will
hirple ten if he hears of a ship embayed.”</p>
<p>Norna, however, seemed to possess over him so complete an ascendency,
that he no longer hesitated to take the man, who now gave strong
symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> of reviving existence, upon his shoulders; and, assisted by
Mordaunt, trudged along the sea-beach with his burden, without farther
remonstrance. Ere he was borne off, the stranger pointed to the chest,
and attempted to mutter something, to which Norna replied, “Enough. It
shall be secured.”</p>
<p>Advancing towards the passage called Erick’s Steps, by which they were
to ascend the cliffs, they met the people from Jarlshof hastening in the
opposite direction. Man and woman, as they passed, reverently made room
for Norna, and saluted her—not without an expression of fear upon some
of their faces. She passed them a few paces, and then turning back,
called aloud to the Ranzelman, who (though the practice was more common
than legal) was attending the rest of the hamlet upon this plundering
expedition. “Neil Ronaldson,” she said, “mark my words. There stands
yonder a chest, from which the lid has been just prized off. Look it be
brought down to your own house at Jarlshof, just as it now is. Beware of
moving or touching the slightest article. He were better in his grave
that so much as looks at the contents. I speak not for nought, nor in
aught will I be disobeyed.”</p>
<p>“Your pleasure shall be done, mother,” said Ronaldson. “I warrant we
will not break bulk, since sic is your bidding.”</p>
<p>Far behind the rest of the villagers, followed an old woman, talking to
herself, and cursing her own decrepitude, which kept her the last of the
party, yet pressing forward with all her might to get her share of the
spoil.</p>
<p>When they met her, Mordaunt was astonished to recognise his father’s old
housekeeper. “How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> now,” he said, “Swertha, what make you so far from
home?”</p>
<p>“Just e’en daikering out to look after my auld master and your honour,”
replied Swertha, who felt like a criminal caught in the manner; for on
more occasions than one, Mr. Mertoun had intimated his high
disapprobation of such excursions as she was at present engaged in.</p>
<p>But Mordaunt was too much engaged with his own thoughts to take much
notice of her delinquency. “Have you seen my father?” he said.</p>
<p>“And that I have,” replied Swertha—“The gude gentleman was ganging to
hirsel himsell doun Erick’s Steps, whilk would have been the ending of
him, that is in no way a cragsman. Sae I e’en gat him wiled away
hame—and I was just seeking you that you may gang after him to the
hall-house, for to my thought he is far frae weel.”</p>
<p>“My father unwell?” said Mordaunt, remembering the faintness he had
exhibited at the commencement of that morning’s walk.</p>
<p>“Far frae weel—far frae weel,” groaned out Swertha, with a piteous
shake of the head—“white o’ the gills—white o’ the gills—and him to
think of coming down the riva!”</p>
<p>“Return home, Mordaunt,” said Norna, who was listening to what had
passed. “I will see all that is necessary done for this man’s relief,
and you will find him at the Ranzelman’s, when you list to enquire. You
cannot help him more than you already have done.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt felt this was true, and, commanding Swertha to follow him
instantly, betook himself to the path homeward.</p>
<p>Swertha hobbled reluctantly after her young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> master in the same
direction, until she lost sight of him on his entering the cleft of the
rock; then instantly turned about, muttering to herself, “Haste home, in
good sooth?—haste home, and lose the best chance of getting a new
rokelay and owerlay that I have had these ten years? by my certie,
na—It’s seldom sic rich godsends come on our shore—no since the Jenny
and James came ashore in King Charlie’s time.”</p>
<p>So saying, she mended her pace as well as she could, and, a willing mind
making amends for frail limbs, posted on with wonderful dispatch to put
in for her share of the spoil. She soon reached the beach, where the
Ranzelman, stuffing his own pouches all the while, was exhorting the
rest to part things fair, and be neighbourly, and to give to the auld
and helpless a share of what was going, which, he charitably remarked,
would bring a blessing on the shore, and send them “mair wrecks ere
winter.”<a id="FNanchor_32_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_38">[32]</a></p>

</p>
<p>The light foot of Mordaunt Mertoun was not long of bearing him to
Jarlshof. He entered the house hastily, for what he himself had observed
that morning, corresponded in some degree with the ideas which Swertha’s
tale was calculated to excite. He found his father, however, in the
inner apartment, reposing himself after his fatigue; and his first
question satisfied him that the good dame had practised a little
imposition to get rid of them both.</p>
<p>“Where is this dying man, whom you have so wisely ventured your own neck
to relieve?” said the elder Mertoun to the younger.</p>
<p>“Norna, sir,” replied Mordaunt, “has taken him under her charge; she
understands such matters.”</p>
<p>“And is quack as well as witch?” said the elder Mertoun. “With all my
heart—it is a trouble saved. But I hasted home, on Swertha’s hint, to
look out for lint and bandages; for her speech was of broken bones.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt kept silence, well knowing his father would not persevere in
his enquiries upon such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> matter, and not willing either to prejudice
the old governante, or to excite his father to one of those excesses of
passion into which he was apt to burst, when, contrary to his wont, he
thought proper to correct the conduct of his domestic.</p>
<p>It was late in the day ere old Swertha returned from her expedition,
heartily fatigued, and bearing with her a bundle of some bulk,
containing, it would seem, her share of the spoil. Mordaunt instantly
sought her out, to charge her with the deceits she had practised on both
his father and himself; but the accused matron lacked not her reply.</p>
<p>“By her troth;” she said, “she thought it was time to bid Mr. Mertoun
gang hame and get bandages, when she had seen, with her ain twa een,
Mordaunt ganging down the cliff like a wild-cat—it was to be thought
broken bones would be the end, and lucky if bandages wad do any
good;—and, by her troth, she might weel tell Mordaunt his father was
puirly, and him looking sae white in the gills, (whilk, she wad die upon
it, was the very word she used,) and it was a thing that couldna be
denied by man at this very moment.”</p>
<p>“But, Swertha,” said Mordaunt, as soon as her clamorous defence gave him
time to speak in reply, “how came you, that should have been busy with
your housewifery and your spinning, to be out this morning at Erick’s
Steps, in order to take all this unnecessary care of my father and
me?—And what is in that bundle, Swertha? for I fear, Swertha, you have
been transgressing the law, and have been out upon the wrecking system.”</p>
<p>“Fair fa’ your sonsy face, and the blessing of Saint Ronald upon you!”
said Swertha, in a tone betwixt coaxing and jesting; “would you keep a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
puir body frae mending hersell, and sae muckle gear lying on the loose
sand for the lifting?—Hout, Maister Mordaunt, a ship ashore is a sight
to wile the minister out of his very pu’pit in the middle of his
preaching, muckle mair a puir auld ignorant wife frae her rock and her
tow. And little did I get for my day’s wark—just some rags o’ cambric
things, and a bit or twa of coorse claith, and sic like—the strong and
the hearty get a’ thing in this warld.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Swertha,” replied Mordaunt, “and that is rather hard, as you must
have your share of punishment in this world and the next, for robbing
the poor mariners.”</p>
<p>“Hout, callant, wha wad punish an auld wife like me for a wheen
duds?—Folk speak muckle black ill of Earl Patrick; but he was a freend
to the shore, and made wise laws against ony body helping vessels that
were like to gang on the breakers.<a id="FNanchor_33_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_39">[33]</a>—And the mariners, I have heard
Bryce Jagger say, lose their right frae the time keel touches sand; and,
moreover, they are dead and gane, poor souls—dead and gane, and care
little about warld’s wealth now—Nay, nae mair than the great Jarls and
Sea-kings, in the Norse days, did about the treasures that they buried
in the tombs and sepulchres auld langsyne. Did I ever tell you the sang,
Maister Mordaunt, how Olaf Tryguarson garr’d hide five gold crowns in
the same grave with him?”</p>
<p>“No, Swertha,” said Mordaunt, who took pleasure in tormenting the
cunning old plunderer—“you never told me that; but I tell you, that the
stranger whom Norna has taken down to the town, will be well enough
to-morrow, to ask where you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> have hidden the goods that you have stolen
from the wreck.”</p>
<p>“But wha will tell him a word about it, hinnie?” said Swertha, looking
slyly up in her young master’s face—“The mair by token, since I maun
tell ye, that I have a bonny remnant of silk amang the lave, that will
make a dainty waistcoat to yoursell, the first merry-making ye gang to.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt could no longer forbear laughing at the cunning with which the
old dame proposed to bribe off his evidence by imparting a portion of
her plunder; and, desiring her to get ready what provision she had made
for dinner, he returned to his father, whom he found still sitting in
the same place, and nearly in the same posture, in which he had left
him.</p>
<p>When their hasty and frugal meal was finished, Mordaunt announced to his
father his purpose of going down to the town, or hamlet, to look after
the shipwrecked sailor.</p>
<p>The elder Mertoun assented with a nod.</p>
<p>“He must be ill accommodated there, sir,” added his son,—a hint which
only produced another nod of assent. “He seemed, from his appearance,”
pursued Mordaunt, “to be of very good rank—and admitting these poor
people do their best to receive him, in his present weak state, yet”——</p>
<p>“I know what you would say,” said his father, interrupting him; “we, you
think, ought to do something towards assisting him. Go to him, then—if
he lacks money, let him name the sum, and he shall have it; but, for
lodging the stranger here, and holding intercourse with him, I neither
can, nor will do so. I have retired to this farthest extremity of the
British isles, to avoid new friends, and new faces, and none such shall
intrude on me either their happiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> or their misery. When you have
known the world half a score of years longer, your early friends will
have given you reason to remember them, and to avoid new ones for the
rest of your life. Go then—why do you stop?—rid the country of the
man—let me see no one about me but those vulgar countenances, the
extent and character of whose petty knavery I know, and can submit to,
as to an evil too trifling to cause irritation.” He then threw his purse
to his son, and signed to him to depart with all speed.</p>
<p>Mordaunt was not long before he reached the village. In the dark abode
of Neil Ronaldson, the Ranzelman, he found the stranger seated by the
peat-fire, upon the very chest which had excited the cupidity of the
devout Bryce Snailsfoot, the pedlar. The Ranzelman himself was absent,
dividing, with all due impartiality, the spoils of the wrecked vessel
amongst the natives of the community; listening to and redressing their
complaints of inequality; and (if the matter in hand had not been, from
beginning to end, utterly unjust and indefensible) discharging the part
of a wise and prudent magistrate, in all the details. For at this time,
and probably until a much later period, the lower orders of the
islanders entertained an opinion, common to barbarians also in the same
situation, that whatever was cast on their shores, became their
indisputable property.</p>
<p>Margery Bimbister, the worthy spouse of the Ranzelman, was in the charge
of the house, and introduced Mordaunt to her guest, saying, with no
great ceremony, “This is the young tacksman—You will maybe tell him
your name, though you will not tell it to us. If it had not been for
his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> four quarters, it’s but little you would have said to any body, sae
lang as life lasted.”</p>
<p>The stranger arose, and shook Mordaunt by the hand; observing, he
understood that he had been the means of saving his life and his chest.
“The rest of the property,” he said, “is, I see, walking the plank; for
they are as busy as the devil in a gale of wind.”</p>
<p>“And what was the use of your seamanship, then,” said Margery, “that you
couldna keep off the Sumburgh-head? It would have been lang ere
Sumburgh-head had come to you.”</p>
<p>“Leave us for a moment, good Margery Bimbister,” said Mordaunt; “I wish
to have some private conversation with this gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Gentleman!” said Margery, with an emphasis; “not but the man is well
enough to look at,” she added, again surveying him, “but I doubt if
there is muckle of the gentleman about him.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt looked at the stranger, and was of a different opinion. He was
rather above the middle size, and formed handsomely as well as strongly.
Mordaunt’s intercourse with society was not extensive; but he thought
his new acquaintance, to a bold sunburnt handsome countenance, which
seemed to have faced various climates, added the frank and open manners
of a sailor. He answered cheerfully the enquiries which Mordaunt made
after his health; and maintained that one night’s rest would relieve him
from all the effects of the disaster he had sustained. But he spoke with
bitterness of the avarice and curiosity of the Ranzelman and his spouse.</p>
<p>“That chattering old woman,” said the stranger, “has persecuted me the
whole day for the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> the ship. I think she might be contented with
the share she has had of it. I was the principal owner of the vessel
that was lost yonder, and they have left me nothing but my wearing
apparel. Is there no magistrate, or justice of the peace, in this wild
country, that would lend a hand to help one when he is among the
breakers?”</p>
<p>Mordaunt mentioned Magnus Troil, the principal proprietor, as well as
the Fowd, or provincial judge, of the district, as the person from whom
he was most likely to obtain redress; and regretted that his own youth,
and his father’s situation as a retired stranger, should put it out of
their power to afford him the protection he required.</p>
<p>“Nay, for your part, you have done enough,” said the sailor; “but if I
had five out of the forty brave fellows that are fishes’ food by this
time, the devil a man would I ask to do me the right that I could do for
myself!”</p>
<p>“Forty hands!” said Mordaunt; “you were well manned for the size of the
ship.”</p>
<p>“Not so well as we needed to be. We mounted ten guns, besides chasers;
but our cruise on the main had thinned us of men, and lumbered us up
with goods. Six of our guns were in ballast—Hands! if I had had enough
of hands, we would never have miscarried so infernally. The people were
knocked up with working the pumps, and so took to their boats, and left
me with the vessel, to sink or swim. But the dogs had their pay, and I
can afford to pardon them—The boat swamped in the current—all were
lost—and here am I.”</p>
<p>“You had come north about then, from the West Indies?” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Ay, ay; the vessel was the Good Hope of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> Bristol, a letter of marque.
She had fine luck down on the Spanish main, both with commerce and
privateering, but the luck’s ended with her now. My name is Clement
Cleveland, captain, and part owner, as I said before—I am a Bristol man
born—my father was well known on the Tollsell—old Clem Cleveland of
the College-green.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt had no right to enquire farther, and yet it seemed to him as if
his own mind was but half satisfied. There was an affectation of
bluntness, a sort of defiance, in the manner of the stranger, for which
circumstances afforded no occasion. Captain Cleveland had suffered
injustice from the islanders, but from Mordaunt he had only received
kindness and protection; yet he seemed as if he involved all the
neighbourhood in the wrongs he complained of. Mordaunt looked down and
was silent, doubting whether it would be better to take his leave, or to
proceed farther in his offers of assistance. Cleveland seemed to guess
at his thoughts, for he immediately added, in a conciliating manner,—“I
am a plain man, Master Mertoun, for that I understand is your name; and
I am a ruined man to boot, and that does not mend one’s good manners.
But you have done a kind and friendly part by me, and it may be I think
as much of it as if I thanked you more. And so before I leave this
place, I’ll give you my fowlingpiece; she will put a hundred swan-shot
through a Dutchman’s cap at eighty paces—she will carry ball too—I
have hit a wild bull within a hundred-and-fifty yards—but I have two
pieces that are as good, or better, so you may keep this for my sake.”</p>
<p>“That would be to take my share of the wreck,” answered Mordaunt,
laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>“No such matter,” said Cleveland, undoing a case which contained several
guns and pistols,—“you see I have saved my private arm-chest, as well
as my clothes—<i>that</i> the tall old woman in the dark rigging managed for
me. And, between ourselves, it is worth all I have lost; for,” he added,
lowering his voice, and looking round, “when I speak of being ruined in
the hearing of these landsharks, I do not mean ruined stock and block.
No, here is something will do more than shoot sea-fowl.” So saying, he
pulled out a great ammunition-pouch marked swan-shot, and showed
Mordaunt, hastily, that it was full of Spanish pistoles and Portagues
(as the broad Portugal pieces were then called.) “No, no,” he added,
with a smile, “I have ballast enough to trim the vessel again; and now,
will you take the piece?”</p>
<p>“Since you are willing to give it me,” said Mordaunt, laughing, “with
all my heart. I was just going to ask you in my father’s name,” he
added, showing his purse, “whether you wanted any of that same ballast.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, but you see I am provided—take my old acquaintance, and may
she serve you as well as she has served me; but you will never make so
good a voyage with her. You can shoot, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Tolerably well,” said Mordaunt, admiring the piece, which was a
beautiful Spanish-barrelled gun, inlaid with gold, small in the bore,
and of unusual length, such as is chiefly used for shooting sea-fowl,
and for ball-practice.</p>
<p>“With slugs,” continued the donor, “never gun shot closer; and with
single ball, you may kill a seal two hundred yards at sea from the top
of the highest peak of this iron-bound coast of yours. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> I tell you
again, that the old rattler will never do you the service she has done
me.”</p>
<p>“I shall not use her so dexterously, perhaps,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Umph!—perhaps not,” replied Cleveland; “but that is not the question.
What say you to shooting the man at the wheel, just as we run aboard of
a Spaniard? So the Don was taken aback, and we laid him athwart the
hawse, and carried her cutlass in hand; and worth the while she
was—stout brigantine—El Santo Francisco—bound for Porto Bello, with
gold and negroes. That little bit of lead was worth twenty thousand
pistoles.”</p>
<p>“I have shot at no such game as yet,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Well, all in good time; we cannot weigh till the tide makes. But you
are a tight, handsome, active young man. What is to ail you to take a
trip after some of this stuff?” laying his hand on the bag of gold.</p>
<p>“My father talks of my travelling soon,” replied Mordaunt, who, born to
hold men-of-wars-men in great respect, felt flattered by this invitation
from one who appeared a thorough-bred seaman.</p>
<p>“I respect him for the thought,” said the Captain; “and I will visit him
before I weigh anchor. I have a consort off these islands, and be cursed
to her. She’ll find me out somewhere, though she parted company in the
bit of a squall, unless she is gone to Davy Jones too.—Well, she was
better found than we, and not so deep loaded—she must have weathered
it. We’ll have a hammock slung for you aboard, and make a sailor and a
man of you in the same trip.”</p>
<p>“I should like it well enough,” said Mordaunt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> who eagerly longed to
see more of the world than his lonely situation had hitherto permitted;
“but then my father must decide.”</p>
<p>“Your father? pooh!” said Captain Cleveland;—“but you are very right,”
he added, checking himself; “Gad, I have lived so long at sea, that I
cannot imagine any body has a right to think except the captain and the
master. But you are very right. I will go up to the old gentleman this
instant, and speak to him myself. He lives in that handsome,
modern-looking building, I suppose, that I see a quarter of a mile off?”</p>
<p>“In that old half-ruined house,” said Mordaunt, “he does indeed live;
but he will see no visitors.”</p>
<p>“Then you must drive the point yourself, for I can’t stay in this
latitude. Since your father is no magistrate, I must go to see this same
Magnus—how call you him?—who is not justice of peace, but something
else that will do the turn as well. These fellows have got two or three
things that I must and will have back—let them keep the rest and be
d—d to them. Will you give me a letter to him, just by way of
commission?”</p>
<p>“It is scarce needful,” said Mordaunt. “It is enough that you are
shipwrecked, and need his help;—but yet I may as well furnish you with
a letter of introduction.”</p>
<p>“There,” said the sailor, producing a writing-case from his chest, “are
your writing-tools.—Meantime, since bulk has been broken, I will nail
down the hatches, and make sure of the cargo.”</p>
<p>While Mordaunt, accordingly, was engaged in writing to Magnus Troil a
letter, setting forth the circumstances in which Captain Cleveland had
been thrown upon their coast, the Captain, having first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> selected and
laid aside some wearing apparel and necessaries enough to fill a
knapsack, took in hand hammer and nails, employed himself in securing
the lid of his sea-chest, by fastening it down in a workmanlike manner,
and then added the corroborating security of a cord, twisted and knotted
with nautical dexterity. “I leave this in your charge,” he said, “all
except this,” showing the bag of gold, “and these,” pointing to a
cutlass and pistols, “which may prevent all further risk of my parting
company with my Portagues.”</p>
<p>“You will find no occasion for weapons in this country, Captain
Cleveland,” replied Mordaunt; “a child might travel with a purse of gold
from Sumburgh-head to the Scaw of Unst, and no soul would injure him.”</p>
<p>“And that’s pretty boldly said, young gentleman, considering what is
going on without doors at this moment.”</p>
<p>“O,” replied Mordaunt, a little confused, “what comes on land with the
tide, they reckon their lawful property. One would think they had
studied under Sir Arthegal, who pronounces—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘For equal right in equal things doth stand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And what the mighty sea hath once possess’d,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plucked quite from all possessors’ hands,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or else by wrecks that wretches have distress’d,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He may dispose, by his resistless might,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As things at random left, to whom he list.’”</span><br>
</p>
<p>“I shall think the better of plays and ballads as long as I live, for
these very words,” said Captain Cleveland; “and yet I have loved them
well enough in my day. But this is good doctrine, and more men than one
may trim their sails to such a breeze.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> What the sea sends is ours,
that’s sure enough. However, in case that your good folks should think
the land as well as the sea may present them with waiffs and strays, I
will make bold to take my cutlass and pistols.—Will you cause my chest
to be secured in your own house till you hear from me, and use your
influence to procure me a guide to show me the way, and to carry my
kit?”</p>
<p>“Will you go by sea or land?” said Mordaunt, in reply.</p>
<p>“By sea!” exclaimed Cleveland. “What—in one of these cockleshells, and
a cracked cockleshell, to boot? No, no—land, land, unless I knew my
crew, my vessel, and my voyage.”</p>
<p>They parted accordingly, Captain Cleveland being supplied with a guide
to conduct him to Burgh-Westra, and his chest being carefully removed to
the mansion-house at Jarlshof.</p>

</p>
<p>On the subsequent morning, Mordaunt, in answer to his father’s
enquiries, began to give him some account of the shipwrecked mariner,
whom he had rescued from the waves. But he had not proceeded far in
recapitulating the particulars which Cleveland had communicated, when
Mr. Mertoun’s looks became disturbed—he arose hastily, and, after
pacing twice or thrice across the room, he retired into the inner
chamber, to which he usually confined himself, while under the influence
of his mental malady. In the evening he re-appeared, without any traces
of his disorder; but it may be easily supposed that his son avoided
recurring to the subject which had affected him.</p>
<p>Mordaunt Mertoun was thus left without assistance, to form at his
leisure his own opinion respecting the new acquaintance which the sea
had sent him; and, upon the whole, he was himself surprised to find the
result less favourable to the stranger than he could well account for.
There seemed to Mordaunt to be a sort of repelling influence about the
man. True, he was a handsome man, of a frank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and prepossessing manner,
but there was an assumption of superiority about him, which Mordaunt did
not quite so much like. Although he was so keen a sportsman as to be
delighted with his acquisition of the Spanish-barrelled gun, and
accordingly mounted and dismounted it with great interest, paying the
utmost attention to the most minute parts about the lock and ornaments,
yet he was, upon the whole, inclined to have some scruples about the
mode in which he had acquired it.</p>
<p>“I should not have accepted it,” he thought; “perhaps Captain Cleveland
might give it me as a sort of payment for the trifling service I did
him; and yet it would have been churlish to refuse it in the way it was
offered. I wish he had looked more like a man whom one would have chosen
to be obliged to.”</p>
<p>But a successful day’s shooting reconciled him to his gun, and he became
assured, like most young sportsmen in similar circumstances, that all
other pieces were but pop-guns in comparison. But then, to be doomed to
shoot gulls and seals, when there were Frenchmen and Spaniards to be
come at—when there were ships to be boarded, and steersmen to be marked
off, seemed but a dull and contemptible destiny. His father had
mentioned his leaving these islands, and no other mode of occupation
occurred to his inexperience, save that of the sea, with which he had
been conversant from his infancy. His ambition had formerly aimed no
higher than at sharing the fatigues and dangers of a Greenland fishing
expedition; for it was in that scene that the Zetlanders laid most of
their perilous adventures. But war was again raging, the history of Sir
Francis Drake, Captain Morgan, and other bold adventurers, an account of
whose exploits he had purchased from Bryce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> Snailsfoot, had made much
impression on his mind, and the offer of Captain Cleveland to take him
to sea, frequently recurred to him, although the pleasure of such a
project was somewhat damped by a doubt, whether, in the long run, he
should not find many objections to his proposed commander. Thus much he
already saw, that he was opinionative, and might probably prove
arbitrary; and that, since even his kindness was mingled with an
assumption of superiority, his occasional displeasure might contain a
great deal more of that disagreeable ingredient than could be palatable
to those who sailed under him. And yet, after counting all risks, could
his father’s consent be obtained, with what pleasure, he thought, would
he embark in quest of new scenes and strange adventures, in which he
proposed to himself to achieve such deeds as should be the theme of many
a tale to the lovely sisters of Burgh-Westra—tales at which Minna
should weep, and Brenda should smile, and both should marvel! And this
was to be the reward of his labours and his dangers; for the hearth of
Magnus Troil had a magnetic influence over his thoughts, and however
they might traverse amid his day-dreams, it was the point where they
finally settled.</p>
<p>There were times when Mordaunt thought of mentioning to his father the
conversation he had held with Captain Cleveland, and the seaman’s
proposal to him; but the very short and general account which he had
given of that person’s history, upon the morning after his departure
from the hamlet, had produced a sinister effect on Mr. Mertoun’s mind,
and discouraged him from speaking farther on any subject connected with
it. It would be time enough, he thought, to mention Captain Cleveland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>’s
proposal, when his consort should arrive, and when he should repeat his
offer in a more formal manner; and these he supposed events likely very
soon to happen.</p>
<p>But days grew to weeks, and weeks were numbered into months, and he
heard nothing from Cleveland; and only learned by an occasional visit
from Bryce Snailsfoot, that the Captain was residing at Burgh-Westra, as
one of the family. Mordaunt was somewhat surprised at this, although the
unlimited hospitality of the islands, which Magnus Troil, both from
fortune and disposition, carried to the utmost extent, made it almost a
matter of course that he should remain in the family until he disposed
of himself otherwise. Still it seemed strange he had not gone to some of
the northern isles to enquire after his consort; or that he did not
rather choose to make Lerwick his residence, where fishing vessels often
brought news from the coasts and ports of Scotland and Holland. Again,
why did he not send for the chest he had deposited at Jarlshof? and
still farther, Mordaunt thought it would have been but polite if the
stranger had sent him some sort of message in token of remembrance.</p>
<p>These subjects of reflection were connected with another still more
unpleasant, and more difficult to account for. Until the arrival of this
person, scarce a week had passed without bringing him some kind
greeting, or token of recollection, from Burgh-Westra; and pretences
were scarce ever wanting for maintaining a constant intercourse. Minna
wanted the words of a Norse ballad; or desired to have, for her various
collections, feathers, or eggs, or shells, or specimens of the rarer
sea-weeds; or Brenda sent a riddle to be resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> or a song to be
learned; or the honest old Udaller,—in a rude manuscript, which might
have passed for an ancient Runic inscription,—sent his hearty greetings
to his good young friend, with a present of something to make good
cheer, and an earnest request he would come to Burgh-Westra as soon, and
stay there as long, as possible. These kindly tokens of remembrance were
often sent by special message; besides which, there was never a
passenger or a traveller, who crossed from the one mansion to the other,
who did not bring to Mordaunt some friendly greeting from the Udaller
and his family. Of late, this intercourse had become more and more
infrequent; and no messenger from Burgh-Westra had visited Jarlshof for
several weeks. Mordaunt both observed and felt this alteration, and it
dwelt on his mind, while he questioned Bryce as closely as pride and
prudence would permit, to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the
change. Yet he endeavoured to assume an indifferent air while he asked
the jagger whether there were no news in the country.</p>
<p>“Great news,” the jagger replied; “and a gay mony of them. That
crackbrained carle, the new factor, is for making a change in the
<i>bismars</i> and the <i>lispunds</i>;<a id="FNanchor_34_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_40">[34]</a> and our worthy Fowd, Magnus Troil, has
sworn, that, sooner than change them for the still-yard, or aught else,
he’ll fling Factor Yellowley from Brassa-craig.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” said Mordaunt, very little interested.</p>
<p>“All? and eneugh, I think,” replied the pedlar. “How are folks to buy
and sell, if the weights are changed on them?”</p>
<p>“Very true,” replied Mordaunt; “but have you heard of no strange vessels
on the coast?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Six Dutch doggers off Brassa; and, as I hear, a high-quartered galliot
thing, with a gaff mainsail, lying in Scalloway Bay. She will be from
Norway.”</p>
<p>“No ships of war, or sloops?”</p>
<p>“None,” replied the pedlar, “since the Kite Tender sailed with the
impress men. If it was His will, and our men were out of her, I wish the
deep sea had her!”</p>
<p>“Were there no news at Burgh-Westra?—Were the family all well?”</p>
<p>“A’ weel, and weel to do—out-taken, it may be, something ower muckle
daffing and laughing—dancing ilk night, they say, wi’ the stranger
captain that’s living there—him that was ashore on Sumburgh-head the
tother day,—less daffing served him then.”</p>
<p>“Daffing! dancing every night!” said Mordaunt, not particularly well
satisfied—“Whom does Captain Cleveland dance with?”</p>
<p>“Ony body he likes, I fancy,” said the jagger; “at ony rate, he gars a’
body yonder dance after his fiddle. But I ken little about it, for I am
no free in conscience to look upon thae flinging fancies. Folk should
mind that life is made but of rotten yarn.”</p>
<p>“I fancy that it is to keep them in mind of that wholesome truth, that
you deal in such tender wares, Bryce,” replied Mordaunt, dissatisfied as
well with the tenor of the reply, as with the affected scruples of the
respondent.</p>
<p>“That’s as muckle as to say, that I suld hae minded you was a flinger
and a fiddler yoursell, Maister Mordaunt; but I am an auld man, and maun
unburden my conscience. But ye will be for the dance, I sall warrant,
that’s to be at Burgh-Westra, on John’s Even, (<i>Saunt</i> John’s, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
blinded creatures ca’ him,) and nae doubt ye will be for some warldly
braws—hose, waistcoats, or sic like? I hae pieces frae Flanders.”—With
that he placed his movable warehouse on the table, and began to unlock
it.</p>
<p>“Dance!” repeated Mordaunt—“Dance on St. John’s Even?—Were you desired
to bid me to it, Bryce?”</p>
<p>“Na—but ye ken weel eneugh ye wad be welcome, bidden or no bidden. This
captain—how ca’ ye him?—is to be skudler, as they ca’t—the first of
the gang, like.”</p>
<p>“The devil take him!” said Mordaunt, in impatient surprise.</p>
<p>“A’ in gude time,” replied the jagger; “hurry no man’s cattle—the devil
will hae his due, I warrant ye, or it winna be for lack of seeking. But
it’s true I’m telling you, for a’ ye stare like a wild-cat; and this
same captain,—I watna his name,—bought ane of the very waistcoats that
I am ganging to show ye—purple, wi’ a gowd binding, and bonnily
broidered; and I have a piece for you, the neighbour of it, wi’ a green
grund; and if ye mean to streek yoursell up beside him, ye maun e’en buy
it, for it’s gowd that glances in the lasses’ een now-a-days. See—look
till’t,” he added, displaying the pattern in various points of view;
“look till <i>it</i> through the light, and till the light through
<i>it</i>—<i>wi’</i> the grain, and <i>against</i> the grain—it shows ony gate—cam
frae Antwerp a’ the gate—four dollars is the price; and yon captain was
sae weel pleased that he flang down a twenty shilling Jacobus, and bade
me keep the change and be d—d!—poor silly profane creature, I pity
him.”</p>
<p>Without enquiring whether the pedlar bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> his compassion on the
worldly imprudence or the religious deficiencies of Captain Cleveland,
Mordaunt turned from him, folded his arms, and paced the apartment,
muttering to himself, “Not asked—A stranger to be king of the
feast!”—Words which he repeated so earnestly, that Bryce caught a part
of their import.</p>
<p>“As for asking, I am almaist bauld to say, that ye will be asked,
Maister Mordaunt.”</p>
<p>“Did they mention my name, then?” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“I canna preceesely say that,” said Bryce Snailsfoot;—“but ye needna
turn away your head sae sourly, like a sealgh when he leaves the shore;
for, do you see, I heard distinctly that a’ the revellers about are to
be there; and is’t to be thought they would leave out you, an auld kend
freend, and the lightest foot at sic frolics (Heaven send you a better
praise in His ain gude time!) that ever flang at a fiddle-squeak,
between this and Unst? Sae I consider ye altogether the same as
invited—and ye had best provide yourself wi’ a waistcoat, for brave and
brisk will every man be that’s there—the Lord pity them!”</p>
<p>He thus continued to follow with his green glazen eyes the motions of
young Mordaunt Mertoun, who was pacing the room in a very pensive
manner, which the jagger probably misinterpreted, as he thought, like
Claudio, that if a man is sad, it must needs be because he lacks money.
Bryce, therefore, after another pause, thus accosted him. “Ye needna be
sad about the matter, Maister Mordaunt; for although I got the just
price of the article from the captain-man, yet I maun deal freendly wi’
you, as a kend freend and customer, and bring the price, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> they say,
within your purse-mouth—or it’s the same to me to let it lie ower till
Martinmas, or e’en to Candlemas. I am decent in the warld, Maister
Mordaunt—forbid that I should hurry ony body, far mair a freend that
has paid me siller afore now. Or I wad be content to swap the garment
for the value in feathers or sea-otters’ skins, or ony kind of
peltrie—nane kens better than yoursell how to come by sic ware—and I
am sure I hae furnished you wi’ the primest o’ powder. I dinna ken if I
tell’d ye it was out o’ the kist of Captain Plunket, that perished on
the Scaw of Unst, wi’ the armed brig Mary, sax years syne. He was a
prime fowler himself, and luck it was that the kist came ashore dry. I
sell that to nane but gude marksmen. And so, I was saying, if ye had ony
wares ye liked to coup<a id="FNanchor_35_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_41">[35]</a> for the waistcoat, I wad be ready to trock
wi’ you, for assuredly ye will be wanted at Burgh-Westra, on Saint
John’s Even; and ye wadna like to look waur than the Captain—that wadna
be setting.”</p>
<p>“I will be there at least, whether wanted or not,” said Mordaunt,
stopping short in his walk, and taking the waistcoat-piece hastily out
of the pedlar’s hand; “and, as you say, will not disgrace them.”</p>
<p>“Haud a care—haud a care, Maister Mordaunt,” exclaimed the pedlar; “ye
handle it as it were a bale of coarse wadmaal—ye’ll fray’t to bits—ye
might weel say my ware is tender—and ye’ll mind the price is four
dollars—Sall I put ye in my book for it?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Mordaunt, hastily; and, taking out his purse, he flung down
the money.</p>
<p>“Grace to ye to wear the garment,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> joyous pedlar, “and to me
to guide the siller; and protect us from earthly vanities, and earthly
covetousness; and send you the white linen raiment, whilk is mair to be
desired than the muslins, and cambrics, and lawns, and silks of this
world; and send me the talents which avail more than much fine Spanish
gold, or Dutch dollars either—and—but God guide the callant, what for
is he wrapping the silk up that gate, like a wisp of hay?”</p>
<p>At this moment, old Swertha the housekeeper entered, to whom, as if
eager to get rid of the subject, Mordaunt threw his purchase, with
something like careless disdain; and, telling her to put it aside,
snatched his gun, which stood in the corner, threw his shooting
accoutrements about him, and, without noticing Bryce’s attempt to enter
into conversation upon the “braw seal-skin, as saft as doe-leather,”
which made the sling and cover of his fowlingpiece, he left the
apartment abruptly.</p>
<p>The jagger, with those green, goggling, and gain-descrying kind of
optics, which we have already described, continued gazing for an instant
after the customer, who treated his wares with such irreverence.</p>
<p>Swertha also looked after him with some surprise. “The callant’s in a
creel,” quoth she.</p>
<p>“In a creel!” echoed the pedlar; “he will be as wowf as ever his father
was. To guide in that gate a bargain that cost him four dollars!—very,
very Fifish, as the east-country fisher-folk say.”</p>
<p>“Four dollars for that green rag!” said Swertha, catching at the words
which the jagger had unwarily suffered to escape—“that was a bargain
indeed! I wonder whether he is the greater fule, or you the mair rogue,
Bryce Snailsfoot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I didna say it cost him preceesely four dollars,” said Snailsfoot; “but
if it had, the lad’s siller’s his ain, I hope; and he is auld eneugh to
make his ain bargains. Mair by token the gudes are weel worth the money,
and mair.”</p>
<p>“Mair by token,” said Swertha, coolly, “I will see what his father
thinks about it.”</p>
<p>“Ye’ll no be sae ill-natured, Mrs. Swertha,” said the jagger; “that will
be but cauld thanks for the bonny owerlay that I hae brought you a’ the
way frae Lerwick.”</p>
<p>“And a bonny price ye’ll be setting on’t,” said Swertha; “for that’s the
gate your good deeds end.”</p>
<p>“Ye sall hae the fixing of the price yoursell; or it may lie ower till
ye’re buying something for the house, or for your master, and it can
make a’ ae count.”</p>
<p>“Troth, and that’s true, Bryce Snailsfoot, I am thinking we’ll want some
napery sune—for it’s no to be thought we can spin, and the like, as if
there was a mistress in the house; and sae we make nane at hame.”</p>
<p>“And that’s what I ca’ walking by the word,” said the jagger. “‘Go unto
those that buy and sell;’ there’s muckle profit in that text.”</p>
<p>“There is a pleasure in dealing wi’ a discreet man, that can make profit
of ony thing,” said Swertha; “and now that I take another look at that
daft callant’s waistcoat piece, I think it <i>is</i> honestly worth four
dollars.”</p>

<div class="sblockquot">
<p>I have possessed the regulation of the weather and the
distribution of the seasons. The sun has listened to my
dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction;
the clouds, at my command, have poured forth their waters.</p>
<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Rasselas.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Any sudden cause for anxious and mortifying reflection, which, in
advanced age, occasions sullen and pensive inactivity, stimulates youth
to eager and active exertion; as if, like the hurt deer, they
endeavoured to drown the pain of the shaft by the rapidity of motion.
When Mordaunt caught up his gun, and rushed out of the house of
Jarlshof, he walked on with great activity over waste and wild, without
any determined purpose, except that of escaping, if possible, from the
smart of his own irritation. His pride was effectually mortified by the
report of the jagger, which coincided exactly with some doubts he had
been led to entertain, by the long and unkind silence of his friends at
Burgh-Westra.</p>
<p>If the fortunes of Cæsar had doomed him, as the poet suggests, to have
been</p>
<p class="center">“But the best wrestler on the green,”</p>
<p class="noidt">it is nevertheless to be presumed, that a foil from a rival, in that
rustic exercise, would have mortified him as much as a defeat from a
competitor, when he was struggling for the empery of the world. And even
so Mordaunt Mertoun, degraded in his own eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> from the height which he
had occupied as the chief amongst the youth of the island, felt vexed
and irritated, as well as humbled. The two beautiful sisters, also,
whose smiles all were so desirous of acquiring, with whom he had lived
on terms of such familiar affection, that, with the same ease and
innocence, there was unconsciously mixed a shade of deeper though
undefined tenderness than characterises fraternal love,—they also
seemed to have forgotten him. He could not be ignorant, that, in the
universal opinion of all Dunrossness, nay, of the whole Mainland, he
might have had every chance of being the favoured lover of either; and
now at once, and without any failure on his part, he was become so
little to them, that he had lost even the consequence of an ordinary
acquaintance. The old Udaller, too, whose hearty and sincere character
should have made him more constant in his friendships, seemed to have
been as fickle as his daughters, and poor Mordaunt had at once lost the
smiles of the fair, and the favour of the powerful. These were
uncomfortable reflections, and he doubled his pace, that he might
outstrip them if possible.</p>
<p>Without exactly reflecting upon the route which he pursued, Mordaunt
walked briskly on through a country where neither hedge, wall, nor
enclosure of any kind, interrupts the steps of the wanderer, until he
reached a very solitary spot, where, embosomed among steep heathy hills,
which sunk suddenly down on the verge of the water, lay one of those
small fresh-water lakes which are common in the Zetland isles, whose
outlets form the sources of the small brooks and rivulets by which the
country is watered, and serve to drive the little mills which
manufacture their grain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a mild summer day; the beams of the sun, as is not uncommon in
Zetland, were moderated and shaded by a silvery haze, which filled the
atmosphere, and destroying the strong contrast of light and shade, gave
even to noon the sober livery of the evening twilight. The little lake,
not three-quarters of a mile in circuit, lay in profound quiet; its
surface undimpled, save when one of the numerous water-fowl, which
glided on its surface, dived for an instant under it. The depth of the
water gave the whole that cerulean tint of bluish green, which
occasioned its being called the Green Loch; and at present, it formed so
perfect a mirror to the bleak hills by which it was surrounded, and
which lay reflected on its bosom, that it was difficult to distinguish
the water from the land; nay, in the shadowy uncertainty occasioned by
the thin haze, a stranger could scarce have been sensible that a sheet
of water lay before him. A scene of more complete solitude, having all
its peculiarities heightened by the extreme serenity of the weather, the
quiet grey composed tone of the atmosphere, and the perfect silence of
the elements, could hardly be imagined. The very aquatic birds, who
frequented the spot in great numbers, forbore their usual flight and
screams, and floated in profound tranquillity upon the silent water.</p>
<p>Without taking any determined aim—without having any determined
purpose—without almost thinking what he was about, Mordaunt presented
his fowlingpiece, and fired across the lake. The large swan shot dimpled
its surface like a partial shower of hail—the hills took up the noise
of the report, and repeated it again, and again, and again, to all their
echoes; the water-fowl took to wing in eddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ing and confused wheel,
answering the echoes with a thousand varying screams, from the deep note
of the swabie, or swartback, to the querulous cry of the tirracke and
kittiewake.</p>
<p>Mordaunt looked for a moment on the clamorous crowd with a feeling of
resentment, which he felt disposed at the moment to apply to all nature,
and all her objects, animate or inanimate, however little concerned with
the cause of his internal mortification.</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” he said, “wheel, dive, scream, and clamour as you will, and
all because you have seen a strange sight, and heard an unusual sound.
There is many a one like you in this round world. But you, at least,
shall learn,” he added, as he reloaded his gun, “that strange sights and
strange sounds, ay, and strange acquaintances to boot, have sometimes a
little shade of danger connected with them.—But why should I wreak my
own vexation on these harmless sea-gulls?” he subjoined, after a
moment’s pause; “they have nothing to do with the friends that have
forgotten me.—I loved them all so well,—and to be so soon given up for
the first stranger whom chance threw on the coast!”</p>
<p>As he stood resting upon his gun, and abandoning his mind to the course
of these unpleasant reflections, his meditations were unexpectedly
interrupted by some one touching his shoulder. He looked around, and saw
Norna of the Fitful-head, wrapped in her dark and ample mantle. She had
seen him from the brow of the hill, and had descended to the lake,
through a small ravine which concealed her, until she came with
noiseless step so close to him that he turned round at her touch.</p>
<p>Mordaunt Mertoun was by nature neither timor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ous nor credulous, and a
course of reading more extensive than usual had, in some degree,
fortified his mind against the attacks of superstition; but he would
have been an actual prodigy, if, living in Zetland in the end of the
seventeenth century, he had possessed the philosophy which did not exist
in Scotland generally, until at least two generations later. He doubted
in his own mind the extent, nay, the very existence, of Norna’s
supernatural attributes, which was a high flight of incredulity in the
country where they were universally received; but still his incredulity
went no farther than doubts. She was unquestionably an extraordinary
woman, gifted with an energy above others, acting upon motives peculiar
to herself, and apparently independent of mere earthly considerations.
Impressed with these ideas, which he had imbibed from his youth, it was
not without something like alarm, that he beheld this mysterious female
standing on a sudden so close beside him, and looking upon him with such
sad and severe eyes, as those with which the Fatal Virgins, who,
according to northern mythology, were called the <i>Valkyriur</i>, or
“Choosers of the Slain,” were supposed to regard the young champions
whom they selected to share the banquet of Odin.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, reckoned unlucky, to say the least, to meet with Norna
suddenly alone, and in a place remote from witnesses; and she was
supposed, on such occasions, to have been usually a prophetess of evil,
as well as an omen of misfortune, to those who had such a rencontre.
There were few or none of the islanders, however familiarized with her
occasional appearance in society, that would not have trembled to meet
her on the solitary banks of the Green Loch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>“I bring you no evil, Mordaunt Mertoun,” she said, reading perhaps
something of this superstitious feeling in the looks of the young man.
“Evil from me you never felt, and never will.”</p>
<p>“Nor do I fear any,” said Mordaunt, exerting himself to throw aside an
apprehension which he felt to be unmanly. “Why should I, mother? You
have been ever my friend.”</p>
<p>“Yet, Mordaunt, thou art not of our region; but to none of Zetland
blood, no, not even to those who sit around the hearth-stone of Magnus
Troil, the noble descendants of the ancient Jarls of Orkney, am I more a
well-wisher, than I am to thee, thou kind and brave-hearted boy. When I
hung around thy neck that gifted chain, which all in our isles know was
wrought by no earthly artist, but by the Drows,<a id="FNanchor_36_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_42">[36]</a> in the secret
recesses of their caverns, thou wert then but fifteen years old; yet thy
foot had been on the Maiden-skerrie of Northmaven, known before but to
the webbed sole of the swartback, and thy skiff had been in the deepest
cavern of Brinnastir, where the <i>haaf-fish</i><a id="FNanchor_37_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_43">[37]</a> had before slumbered in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
dark obscurity. Therefore I gave thee that noble gift; and well thou
knowest, that since that day, every eye in these isles has looked on
thee as a son, or as a brother, endowed beyond other youths, and the
favoured of those whose hour of power is when the night meets with the
day.”</p>
<p>“Alas! mother,” said Mordaunt, “your kind gift may have given me favour,
but it has not been able to keep it for me, or I have not been able to
keep it for myself.—What matters it? I shall learn to set as little by
others as they do by me. My father says that I shall soon leave these
islands, and therefore, Mother Norna, I will return to you your fairy
gift, that it may bring more lasting luck to some other than it has done
to me.”</p>
<p>“Despise not the gift of the nameless race,” said Norna, frowning; then
suddenly changing her tone of displeasure to that of mournful solemnity,
she added,—“Despise them not, but, O Mordaunt, court them not! Sit down
on that grey stone—thou art the son of my adoption, and I will doff, as
far as I may, those attributes that sever me from the common mass of
humanity, and speak with you as a parent with a child.”</p>
<p>There was a tremulous tone of grief which mingled with the loftiness of
her language and carriage, and was calculated to excite sympathy, as
well as to attract attention. Mordaunt sat down on the rock which she
pointed out, a fragment which, with many others that lay scattered
around, had been torn by some winter storm from the precipice at the
foot of which it lay, upon the very verge of the water. Norna took her
own seat on a stone at about three feet distance, adjusted her mantle so
that little more than her forehead, her eyes, and a single lock of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
grey hair, were seen from beneath the shade of her dark wadmaal cloak,
and then proceeded in a tone in which the imaginary consequence and
importance so often assumed by lunacy, seemed to contend against the
deep workings of some extraordinary and deeply-rooted mental affliction.</p>
<p>“I was not always,” she said, “that which I now am. I was not always the
wise, the powerful, the commanding, before whom the young stand abashed,
and the old uncover their grey heads. There was a time when my
appearance did not silence mirth, when I sympathized with human passion,
and had my own share in human joy or sorrow. It was a time of
helplessness—it was a time of folly—it was a time of idle and
unfruitful laughter—it was a time of causeless and senseless
tears;—and yet, with its follies, and its sorrows, and its weaknesses,
what would Norna of Fitful-head give to be again the unmarked and happy
maiden that she was in her early days! Hear me, Mordaunt, and bear with
me; for you hear me utter complaints which have never sounded in mortal
ears, and which in mortal ears shall never sound again. I will be what I
ought,” she continued, starting up and extending her lean and withered
arm, “the queen and protectress of these wild and neglected isles,—I
will be her whose foot the wave wets not, save by her permission; ay,
even though its rage be at its wildest madness—whose robe the whirlwind
respects, when it rends the house-rigging from the roof-tree. Bear me
witness, Mordaunt Mertoun,—you heard my words at Harfra—you saw the
tempest sink before them—Speak, bear me witness!”</p>
<p>To have contradicted her in this strain of high-toned enthusiasm, would
have been cruel and un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>availing, even had Mordaunt been more decidedly
convinced than he was, that an insane woman, not one of supernatural
power, stood before him.</p>
<p>“I heard you sing,” he replied, “and I saw the tempest abate.”</p>
<p>“Abate?” exclaimed Norna, striking the ground impatiently with her staff
of black oak; “thou speakest it but half—it sunk at once—sunk in
shorter space than the child that is hushed to silence by the
nurse.—Enough, you know my power—but you know not—mortal man knows
not, and never shall know, the price which I paid to attain it. No,
Mordaunt, never for the widest sway that the ancient Norsemen boasted,
when their banners waved victorious from Bergen to Palestine—never, for
all that the round world contains, do thou barter thy peace of mind for
such greatness as Norna’s.” She resumed her seat upon the rock, drew the
mantle over her face, rested her head upon her hands, and by the
convulsive motion which agitated her bosom, appeared to be weeping
bitterly.</p>
<p>“Good Norna,” said Mordaunt, and paused, scarce knowing what to say that
might console the unhappy woman—“Good Norna,” he again resumed, “if
there be aught in your mind that troubles it, were you not best to go to
the worthy minister at Dunrossness? Men say you have not for many years
been in a Christian congregation—that cannot be well, or right. You are
yourself well known as a healer of bodily disease; but when the mind is
sick, we should draw to the Physician of our souls.”</p>
<p>Norna had raised her person slowly from the stooping posture in which
she sat; but at length she started up on her feet, threw back her
mantle, extended her arm, and while her lip foamed, and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> eye
sparkled, exclaimed in a tone resembling a scream,—“Me did you
speak—me did you bid seek out a priest!—would you kill the good man
with horror?—Me in a Christian congregation!—Would you have the roof
to fall on the sackless assembly, and mingle their blood with their
worship? I—I seek to the good Physician!—Would you have the fiend
claim his prey openly before God and man?”</p>
<p>The extreme agitation of the unhappy speaker naturally led Mordaunt to
the conclusion, which was generally adopted and accredited in that
superstitious country and period. “Wretched woman,” he said, “if indeed
thou hast leagued thyself with the Powers of Evil, why should you not
seek even yet for repentance? But do as thou wilt, I cannot, dare not,
as a Christian, abide longer with you; and take again your gift,” he
said, offering back the chain. “Good can never come of it, if indeed
evil hath not come already.”</p>
<p>“Be still and hear me, thou foolish boy,” said Norna, calmly, as if she
had been restored to reason by the alarm and horror which she perceived
in Mordaunt’s countenance;—“hear me, I say. I am not of those who have
leagued themselves with the Enemy of Mankind, or derive skill or power
from his ministry. And although the unearthly powers <i>were</i> propitiated
by a sacrifice which human tongue can never utter, yet, God knows, my
guilt in that offering was no more than that of the blind man who falls
from the precipice which he could neither see nor shun. O, leave me
not—shun me not—in this hour of weakness! Remain with me till the
temptation be passed, or I will plunge myself into that lake, and rid
myself at once of my power and my wretchedness!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Mordaunt, who had always looked up to this singular woman with a sort of
affection, occasioned no doubt by the early kindness and distinction
which she had shown to him, was readily induced to reassume his seat,
and listen to what she had further to say, in hopes that she would
gradually overcome the violence of her agitation. It was not long ere
she seemed to have gained the victory her companion expected, for she
addressed him in her usual steady and authoritative manner.</p>
<p>“It was not of myself, Mordaunt, that I purposed to speak, when I beheld
you from the summit of yonder grey rock, and came down the path to meet
with you. My fortunes are fixed beyond change, be it for weal or for
woe. For myself I have ceased to feel much; but for those whom she
loves, Norna of the Fitful-head has still those feelings which link her
to her kind. Mark me. There is an eagle, the noblest that builds in
these airy precipices, and into that eagle’s nest there has crept an
adder—wilt thou lend thy aid to crush the reptile, and to save the
noble brood of the lord of the north sky?”</p>
<p>“You must speak more plainly, Norna,” said Mordaunt, “if you would have
me understand or answer you. I am no guesser of riddles.”</p>
<p>“In plain language, then, you know well the family of Burgh-Westra—the
lovely daughters of the generous old Udaller, Magnus Troil,—Minna and
Brenda, I mean? You know them, and you love them?”</p>
<p>“I have known them, mother,” replied Mordaunt, “and I have loved
them—none knows it better than yourself.”</p>
<p>“To know them once,” said Norna, emphatically,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> “is to know them always.
To love them once, is to love them for ever.”</p>
<p>“To have loved them once, is to wish them well for ever,” replied the
youth; “but it is nothing more. To be plain with you, Norna, the family
at Burgh-Westra have of late totally neglected me. But show me the means
of serving them, I will convince you how much I have remembered old
kindness, how little I resent late coldness.”</p>
<p>“It is well spoken, and I will put your purpose to the proof,” replied
Norna. “Magnus Troil has taken a serpent into his bosom—his lovely
daughters are delivered up to the machinations of a villain.”</p>
<p>“You mean the stranger, Cleveland?” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“The stranger who so calls himself,” replied Norna—“the same whom we
found flung ashore, like a waste heap of sea-weed, at the foot of the
Sumburgh-cape. I felt that within me, that would have prompted me to let
him lie till the tide floated him off, as it had floated him on shore. I
repent me I gave not way to it.”</p>
<p>“But,” said Mordaunt, “I cannot repent that I did my duty as a Christian
man. And what right have I to wish otherwise? If Minna, Brenda, Magnus,
and the rest, like that stranger better than me, I have no title to be
offended; nay, I might well be laughed at for bringing myself into
comparison.”</p>
<p>“It is well, and I trust they merit thy unselfish friendship.”</p>
<p>“But I cannot perceive,” said Mordaunt, “in what you can propose that I
should serve them. I have but just learned by Bryce the jagger, that
this Captain Cleveland is all in all with the ladies at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Burgh-Westra,
and with the Udaller himself. I would like ill to intrude myself where I
am not welcome, or to place my home-bred merit in comparison with
Captain Cleveland’s. He can tell them of battles, when I can only speak
of birds’ nests—can speak of shooting Frenchmen, when I can only tell
of shooting seals—he wears gay clothes, and bears a brave countenance;
I am plainly dressed, and plainly nurtured. Such gay gallants as he can
noose the hearts of those he lives with, as the fowler nooses the
guillemot with his rod and line.”</p>
<p>“You do wrong to yourself,” replied Norna, “wrong to yourself, and
greater wrong to Minna and Brenda. And trust not the reports of
Bryce—he is like the greedy chaffer-whale, that will change his course
and dive for the most petty coin which a fisher can cast at him. Certain
it is, that if you have been lessened in the opinion of Magnus Troil,
that sordid fellow hath had some share in it. But let him count his
vantage, for my eye is upon him.”</p>
<p>“And why, mother,” said Mordaunt, “do you not tell to Magnus what you
have told to me?”</p>
<p>“Because,” replied Norna, “they who wax wise in their own conceit must
be taught a bitter lesson by experience. It was but yesterday that I
spoke with Magnus, and what was his reply?—‘Good Norna, you grow old.’
And this was spoken by one bounden to me by so many and such close
ties—by the descendant of the ancient Norse earls—this was from Magnus
Troil to me; and it was said in behalf of one, whom the sea flung forth
as wreck-weed! Since he despises the counsel of the aged, he shall be
taught by that of the young; and well that he is not left to his own
folly. Go, therefore, to Burgh-Westra, as usual, upon the Baptist’s
festival.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I have had no invitation,” said Mordaunt; “I am not wanted, not wished
for, not thought of—perhaps I shall not be acknowledged if I go
thither; and yet, mother, to confess the truth, thither I had thought to
go.”</p>
<p>“It was a good thought, and to be cherished,” replied Norna; “we seek
our friends when they are sick in health, why not when they are sick in
mind, and surfeited with prosperity? Do not fail to go—it may be, we
shall meet there. Meanwhile our roads lie different. Farewell, and speak
not of this meeting.”</p>
<p>They parted, and Mordaunt remained standing by the lake, with his eyes
fixed on Norna, until her tall dark form became invisible among the
windings of the valley down which she wandered, and Mordaunt returned to
his father’s mansion, determined to follow counsel which coincided so
well with his own wishes.</p>

well as in the precious metals, and are sometimes propitious to
mortals, but more frequently capricious and malevolent. Among
the common people of Zetland, their existence still forms an article
of universal belief. In the neighbouring isles of Feroe, they
are called Foddenskencand, or subterranean people; and Lucas
Jacobson Debes,<a id="FNanchor_H_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_H_44">(<i>h</i>)</a> well acquainted with their nature, assures us
that they inhabit those places which are polluted with the effusion
of blood, or the practice of any crying sin. They have a
government, which seems to be monarchical.</p></div>

</p>
<p>The festal day approached, and still no invitation arrived for that
guest, without whom, but a little space since, no feast could have been
held in the island; while, on the other hand, such reports as reached
them on every side spoke highly of the favour which Captain Cleveland
enjoyed in the good graces of the old Udaller of Burgh-Westra. Swertha
and the Ranzelman shook their heads at these mutations, and reminded
Mordaunt, by many a half-hint and innuendo, that he had incurred this
eclipse by being so imprudently active to secure the safety of the
stranger, when he lay at the mercy of the next wave beneath the cliffs
of Sumburgh-head. “It is best to let saut water take its gate,” said
Swertha; “luck never came of crossing it.”</p>
<p>“In troth,” said the Ranzelman, “they are wise folks that let wave and
withy haud their ain—luck never came of a half-drowned man, or a
half-hanged ane either. Who was’t shot Will Paterson off the Noss?—the
Dutchman that he saved from sinking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> I trow. To fling a drowning man a
plank or a tow, may be the part of a Christian; but I say, keep hands
aff him, if ye wad live and thrive free frae his danger.”</p>
<p>“Ye are a wise man, Ranzelman, and a worthy,” echoed Swertha, with a
groan, “and ken how and whan to help a neighbour, as well as ony man
that ever drew a net.”</p>
<p>“In troth, I have seen length of days,” answered the Ranzelman, “and I
have heard what the auld folk said to each other anent sic matters; and
nae man in Zetland shall go farther than I will in any Christian service
to a man on firm land; but if he cry ‘Help!’ out of the saut waves,
that’s another story.”</p>
<p>“And yet, to think of this lad Cleveland standing in our Maister
Mordaunt’s light,” said Swertha, “and with Magnus Troil, that thought
him the flower of the island but on Whitsunday last, and Magnus, too,
that’s both held (when he’s fresh, honest man) the wisest and wealthiest
of Zetland!”</p>
<p>“He canna win by it,” said the Ranzelman, with a look of the deepest
sagacity. “There’s whiles, Swertha, that the wisest of us (as I am sure
I humbly confess mysell not to be) may be little better than gulls, and
can no more win by doing deeds of folly than I can step over
Sumburgh-head. It has been my own case once or twice in my life. But we
shall see soon what ill is to come of all this, for good there cannot
come.”</p>
<p>And Swertha answered, with the same tone of prophetic wisdom, “Na, na,
gude can never come on it, and that is ower truly said.”</p>
<p>These doleful predictions, repeated from time to time, had some effect
upon Mordaunt. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> indeed suppose, that the charitable action of
relieving a drowning man had subjected him, as a necessary and fatal
consequence, to the unpleasant circumstances in which he was placed; yet
he felt as if a sort of spell were drawn around him, of which he neither
understood the nature nor the extent;—that some power, in short, beyond
his own control, was acting upon his destiny, and, as it seemed, with no
friendly influence. His curiosity, as well as his anxiety, was highly
excited, and he continued determined, at all events, to make his
appearance at the approaching festival, when he was impressed with the
belief that something uncommon was necessarily to take place, which
should determine his future views and prospects in life.</p>
<p>As the elder Mertoun was at this time in his ordinary state of health,
it became necessary that his son should intimate to him his intended
visit to Burgh-Westra. He did so; and his father desired to know the
especial reason of his going thither at this particular time.</p>
<p>“It is a time of merry-making,” replied the youth, “and all the country
are assembled.”</p>
<p>“And you are doubtless impatient to add another fool to the
number.—Go—but beware how you walk in the path which you are about to
tread—a fall from the cliffs of Foulah were not more fatal.”</p>
<p>“May I ask the reason of your caution, sir?” replied Mordaunt, breaking
through the reserve which ordinarily subsisted betwixt him and his
singular parent.</p>
<p>“Magnus Troil,” said the elder Mertoun, “has two daughters—you are of
the age when men look upon such gauds with eyes of affection, that they
may afterwards learn to curse the day that first opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> their eyes upon
heaven! I bid you beware of them; for, as sure as that death and sin
came into the world by woman, so sure are their soft words, and softer
looks, the utter destruction and ruin of all who put faith in them.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt had sometimes observed his father’s marked dislike to the
female sex, but had never before heard him give vent to it in terms so
determined and precise. He replied, that the daughters of Magnus Troil
were no more to him than any other females in the islands; “they were
even of less importance,” he said, “for they had broken off their
friendship with him, without assigning any cause.”</p>
<p>“And you go to seek the renewal of it?” answered his father. “Silly
moth, that hast once escaped the taper without singeing thy wings, are
you not contented with the safe obscurity of these wilds, but must
hasten back to the flame, which is sure at length to consume thee? But
why should I waste arguments in deterring thee from thy inevitable
fate?—Go where thy destiny calls thee.”</p>
<p>On the succeeding day, which was the eve of the great festival, Mordaunt
set forth on his road to Burgh-Westra, pondering alternately on the
injunctions of Norna—on the ominous words of his father—on the
inauspicious auguries of Swertha and the Ranzelman of Jarlshof—and not
without experiencing that gloom with which so many concurring
circumstances of ill omen combined to oppress his mind.</p>
<p>“It bodes me but a cold reception at Burgh-Westra,” said he; “but my
stay shall be the shorter. I will but find out whether they have been
deceived by this seafaring stranger, or whether they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> acted out of
pure caprice of temper, and love of change of company. If the first be
the case, I will vindicate my character, and let Captain Cleveland look
to himself;—if the latter, why, then, good-night to Burgh-Westra and
all its inmates.”</p>
<p>As he mentally meditated this last alternative, hurt pride, and a return
of fondness for those to whom he supposed he was bidding farewell for
ever, brought a tear into his eye, which he dashed off hastily and
indignantly, as, mending his pace, he continued on his journey.</p>
<p>The weather being now serene and undisturbed, Mordaunt made his way with
an ease that formed a striking contrast to the difficulties which he had
encountered when he last travelled the same route; yet there was a less
pleasing subject for comparison, within his own mind.</p>
<p>“My breast,” he said to himself, “was then against the wind, but my
heart within was serene and happy. I would I had now the same careless
feelings, were they to be bought by battling with the severest storm
that ever blew across these lonely hills!”</p>
<p>With such thoughts, he arrived about noon at Harfra, the habitation, as
the reader may remember, of the ingenious Mr. Yellowley. Our traveller
had, upon the present occasion, taken care to be quite independent of
the niggardly hospitality of this mansion, which was now become infamous
on that account through the whole island, by bringing with him, in his
small knapsack, such provisions as might have sufficed for a longer
journey. In courtesy, however, or rather, perhaps, to get rid of his own
disquieting thoughts, Mordaunt did not fail to call at the mansion,
which he found in singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> commotion. Triptolemus himself, invested
with a pair of large jack-boots, went clattering up and down stairs,
screaming out questions to his sister and his serving-woman Tronda, who
replied with shriller and more complicated screeches. At length, Mrs.
Baby herself made her appearance, her venerable person endued with what
was then called a joseph, an ample garment, which had once been green,
but now, betwixt stains and patches, had become like the vesture of the
patriarch whose name it bore—a garment of divers colours. A
steeple-crowned hat, the purchase of some long-past moment, in which
vanity had got the better of avarice, with a feather which had stood as
much wind and rain as if it had been part of a seamew’s wing, made up
her equipment, save that in her hand she held a silver-mounted whip of
antique fashion. This attire, as well as an air of determined bustle in
the gait and appearance of Mrs. Barbara Yellowley, seemed to bespeak
that she was prepared to take a journey, and cared not, as the saying
goes, who knew that such was her determination.</p>
<p>She was the first that observed Mordaunt on his arrival, and she greeted
him with a degree of mingled emotion. “Be good to us!” she exclaimed,
“if here is not the canty callant that wears yon thing about his neck,
and that snapped up our goose as light as if it had been a
sandie-lavrock!” The admiration of the gold chain, which had formerly
made so deep an impression on her mind, was marked in the first part of
her speech, the recollection of the untimely fate of the smoked goose
was commemorated in the second clause. “I will lay the burden of my
life,” she instantly added, “that he is ganging our gate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I am bound for Burgh-Westra, Mrs. Yellowley,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“And blithe will we be of your company,” she added—“it’s early day to
eat; but if you liked a barley scone and a drink of bland—natheless, it
is ill travelling on a full stomach, besides quelling your appetite for
the feast that is biding you this day; for all sort of prodigality there
will doubtless be.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt produced his own stores, and, explaining that he did not love
to be burdensome to them on this second occasion, invited them to
partake of the provisions he had to offer. Poor Triptolemus, who seldom
saw half so good a dinner as his guest’s luncheon, threw himself upon
the good cheer, like Sancho on the scum of Camacho’s kettle, and even
the lady herself could not resist the temptation, though she gave way to
it with more moderation, and with something like a sense of shame. “She
had let the fire out,” she said, “for it was a pity wasting fuel in so
cold a country, and so she had not thought of getting any thing ready,
as they were to set out so soon; and so she could not but say, that the
young gentleman’s <i>nacket</i> looked very good; and besides, she had some
curiosity to see whether the folks in that country cured their beef in
the same way they did in the north of Scotland.” Under which combined
considerations, Dame Baby made a hearty experiment on the refreshments
which thus unexpectedly presented themselves.</p>
<p>When their extemporary repast was finished, the factor became solicitous
to take the road; and now Mordaunt discovered, that the alacrity with
which he had been received by Mistress Baby was not altogether
disinterested. Neither she nor the learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> Triptolemus felt much
disposed to commit themselves to the wilds of Zetland, without the
assistance of a guide; and although they could have commanded the aid of
one of their own labouring folks, yet the cautious agriculturist
observed, that it would be losing at least one day’s work; and his
sister multiplied his apprehensions by echoing back, “One day’s
work?—ye may weel say twenty—for, set ane of their noses within the
smell of a kail-pot, and their lugs within the sound of a fiddle, and
whistle them back if ye can!”</p>
<p>Now the fortunate arrival of Mordaunt, in the very nick of time, not to
mention the good cheer which he brought with him, made him as welcome as
any one could possibly be to a threshold, which, on all ordinary
occasions, abhorred the passage of a guest; nor was Mr. Yellowley
altogether insensible of the pleasure he promised himself in detailing
his plans of improvement to his young companion, and enjoying what his
fate seldom assigned him—the company of a patient and admiring
listener.</p>
<p>As the factor and his sister were to prosecute their journey on
horseback, it only remained to mount their guide and companion; a thing
easily accomplished, where there are such numbers of shaggy,
long-backed, short-legged ponies, running wild upon the extensive moors,
which are the common pasturage for the cattle of every township, where
shelties, geese, swine, goats, sheep, and little Zetland cows, are
turned out promiscuously, and often in numbers which can obtain but
precarious subsistence from the niggard vegetation. There is, indeed, a
right of individual property in all these animals, which are branded or
tattooed by each owner with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> his own peculiar mark; but when any
passenger has occasional use for a pony, he never scruples to lay hold
of the first which he can catch, puts on a halter, and, having rode him
as far as he finds convenient, turns the animal loose to find his way
back again as he best can—a matter in which the ponies are sufficiently
sagacious.</p>
<p>Although this general exercise of property was one of the enormities
which in due time the factor intended to abolish, yet, like a wise man,
he scrupled not, in the meantime, to avail himself of so general a
practice, which, he condescended to allow, was particularly convenient
for those who (as chanced to be his own present case) had no ponies of
their own on which their neighbours could retaliate. Three shelties,
therefore, were procured from the hill—little shagged animals, more
resembling wild bears than any thing of the horse tribe, yet possessed
of no small degree of strength and spirit, and able to endure as much
fatigue and indifferent usage as any creatures in the world.</p>
<p>Two of these horses were already provided and fully accoutred for the
journey. One of them, destined to bear the fair person of Mistress Baby,
was decorated with a huge side-saddle of venerable antiquity—a mass, as
it were, of cushion and padding, from which depended, on all sides, a
housing of ancient tapestry, which, having been originally intended for
a horse of ordinary size, covered up the diminutive palfrey over which
it was spread, from the ears to the tail, and from the shoulder to the
fetlock, leaving nothing visible but its head, which looked fiercely out
from these enfoldments, like the heraldic representation of a lion
looking out of a bush. Mordaunt gallantly lifted up the fair Mistress
Yel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>lowley, and at the expense of very slight exertion, placed her upon
the summit of her mountainous saddle. It is probable, that, on feeling
herself thus squired and attended upon, and experiencing the long
unwonted consciousness that she was attired in her best array, some
thoughts dawned upon Mistress Baby’s mind, which checkered, for an
instant, those habitual ideas about thrift, that formed the daily and
all-engrossing occupation of her soul. She glanced her eye upon her
faded joseph, and on the long housings of her saddle, as she observed,
with a smile, to Mordaunt, that “travelling was a pleasant thing in fine
weather and agreeable company, if,” she added, glancing a look at a
place where the embroidery was somewhat frayed and tattered, “it was not
sae wasteful to ane’s horse-furniture.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her brother stepped stoutly to his steed; and as he chose,
notwithstanding the serenity of the weather, to throw a long red cloak
over his other garments, his pony was even more completely enveloped in
drapery than that of his sister. It happened, moreover, to be an animal
of an high and contumacious spirit, bouncing and curvetting occasionally
under the weight of Triptolemus, with a vivacity which, notwithstanding
his Yorkshire descent, rather deranged him in the saddle; gambols which,
as the palfrey itself was not visible, except upon the strictest
inspection, had, at a little distance, an effect as if they were the
voluntary movements of the cloaked cavalier, without the assistance of
any other legs than those with which nature had provided him; and, to
any who had viewed Triptolemus under such a persuasion, the gravity, and
even distress, announced in his countenance, must have made a ridiculous
contrast to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> the vivacious caprioles with which he piaffed along the
moor.</p>
<p>Mordaunt kept up with this worthy couple, mounted, according to the
simplicity of the time and country, on the first and readiest pony which
they had been able to press into the service, with no other accoutrement
of any kind than the halter which served to guide him; while Mr.
Yellowley, seeing with pleasure his guide thus readily provided with a
steed, privately resolved, that this rude custom of helping travellers
to horses, without leave of the proprietor, should not be abated in
Zetland, until he came to possess a herd of ponies belonging in property
to himself, and exposed to suffer in the way of retaliation.</p>
<p>But to other uses or abuses of the country, Triptolemus Yellowley showed
himself less tolerant. Long and wearisome were the discourses he held
with Mordaunt, or (to speak much more correctly) the harangues which he
inflicted upon him, concerning the changes which his own advent in these
isles was about to occasion. Unskilled as he was in the modern arts by
which an estate may be improved to such a high degree that it shall
altogether slip through the proprietor’s fingers, Triptolemus had at
least the zeal, if not the knowledge, of a whole agricultural society in
his own person; nor was he surpassed by any who has followed him, in
that noble spirit which scorns to balance profit against outlay, but
holds the glory of effecting a great change on the face of the land, to
be, like virtue, in a great degree its own reward.</p>
<p>No part of the wild and mountainous region over which Mordaunt guided
him, but what suggested to his active imagination some scheme of
improvement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and alteration. He would make a road through yon scarce
passable glen, where at present nothing but the sure-footed creatures on
which they were mounted could tread with any safety. He would substitute
better houses for the skeoes, or sheds built of dry stones, in which the
inhabitants cured or manufactured their fish—they should brew good ale
instead of bland—they should plant forests where tree never grew, and
find mines of treasure where a Danish skilling was accounted a coin of a
most respectable denomination. All these mutations, with many others,
did the worthy factor resolve upon, speaking at the same time with the
utmost confidence of the countenance and assistance which he was to
receive from the higher classes, and especially from Magnus Troil.</p>
<p>“I will impart some of my ideas to the poor man,” he said, “before we
are both many hours older; and you will mark how grateful he will be to
the instructor who brings him knowledge, which is better than wealth.”</p>
<p>“I would not have you build too strongly on that,” said Mordaunt, by way
of caution; “Magnus Troil’s boat is kittle to trim—he likes his own
ways, and his country-ways, and you will as soon teach your sheltie to
dive like a sealgh, as bring Magnus to take a Scottish fashion in the
place of a Norse one; and yet, if he is steady to his old customs, he
may perhaps be as changeable as another in his old friendships.”</p>
<p>“<i>Heus, tu inepte!</i>” said the scholar of Saint Andrews, “steady or
unsteady, what can it matter?—am not I here in point of trust, and in
point of power? and shall a Fowd, by which barbarous appellative this
Magnus Troil still calls himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> presume to measure judgment and weigh
reasons with me, who represent the full dignity of the Chamberlain of
the islands of Orkney and Zetland?”</p>
<p>“Still,” said Mordaunt, “I would advise you not to advance too rashly
upon his prejudices. Magnus Troil, from the hour of his birth to this
day, never saw a greater man than himself, and it is difficult to bridle
an old horse for the first time. Besides, he has at no time in his life
been a patient listener to long explanations, so it is possible that he
may quarrel with your purposed reformation, before you can convince him
of its advantages.”</p>
<p>“How mean you, young man?” said the factor. “Is there one who dwells in
these islands, who is so wretchedly blind as not to be sensible of their
deplorable defects? Can a man,” he added, rising into enthusiasm as he
spoke, “or even a beast, look at that thing there, which they have the
impudence to call a corn-mill,<a id="FNanchor_38_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_45">[38]</a> without trembling to think that corn
should be intrusted to such a miserable molendinary? The wretches are
obliged to have at least fifty in each parish, each trundling away upon
its paltry mill-stone, under the thatch of a roof no bigger than a
bee-skep, instead of a noble and seemly baron’s mill, of which you would
hear the clack through the haill country, and that casts the meal
through the mill-eye by forpits at a time!”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, brother,” said his sister, “that’s spoken like your wise sell.
The mair cost the mair honour—that’s your word ever mair. Can it no
creep into your wise head, man, that ilka body grinds their ain nievefu’
of meal in this country, without plaguing themsells about barons’ mills,
and thirls, and sucken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> and the like trade? How mony a time have I
heard you bell-the-cat with auld Edie Netherstane, the miller at
Grindleburn, and wi’ his very knave too, about in-town and out-town
multures—lock, gowpen, and knaveship,<a id="FNanchor_I_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_I_46">(<i>i</i>)</a> and a’ the lave o’t; and now
naething less will serve you than to bring in the very same fashery on a
wheen puir bodies, that big ilk ane a mill for themselves, sic as it
is?”</p>
<p>“Dinna tell me of gowpen and knaveship!” exclaimed the indignant
agriculturist; “better pay the half of the grist to the miller, to have
the rest grund in a Christian manner, than put good grain into a bairn’s
whirligig. Look at it for a moment, Baby—Bide still, ye cursed imp!”
This interjection was applied to his pony, which began to be extremely
impatient, while its rider interrupted his journey, to point out
all the weak points of the Zetland mill—“Look at it, I say—it’s
just one degree better than a hand-quern—it has neither wheel nor
trindle—neither cog nor happer—Bide still, there’s a canny
beast—it canna grind a bickerfu’ of meal in a quarter of an hour,
and that will be mair like a mash for horse than a meltith for man’s
use—Wherefore—Bide still, I say—wherefore—wherefore—The deil’s in
the beast, and nae good, I think!”</p>
<p>As he uttered the last words, the shelty, which had pranced and
curvetted for some time with much impatience, at length got its head
betwixt its legs, and at once canted its rider into the little rivulet,
which served to drive the depreciated engine he was surveying; then
emancipating itself from the folds of the cloak, fled back towards its
own wilderness, neighing in scorn, and flinging out its heels at every
five yards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>Laughing heartily at his disaster, Mordaunt helped the old man to arise;
while his sister sarcastically congratulated him on having fallen rather
into the shallows of a Zetland rivulet than the depths of a Scottish
mill-pond. Disdaining to reply to this sarcasm, Triptolemus, so soon as
he had recovered his legs, shaken his ears, and found that the folds of
his cloak had saved him from being much wet in the scanty streamlet,
exclaimed aloud, “I will have cussers from Lanarkshire—brood mares from
Ayrshire—I will not have one of these cursed abortions left on the
islands, to break honest folk’s necks—I say, Baby, I will rid the land
of them.”</p>
<p>“Ye had better wring your ain cloak, Triptolemus,” answered Baby.</p>
<p>Mordaunt meanwhile was employed in catching another pony, from a herd
which strayed at some distance; and, having made a halter out of twisted
rushes, he seated the dismayed agriculturist in safety upon a more
quiet, though less active steed, than that which he had at first
bestrode.</p>
<p>But Mr. Yellowley’s fall had operated as a considerable sedative upon
his spirits, and, for the full space of five miles’ travel, he said
scarce a word, leaving full course to the melancholy aspirations and
lamentations which his sister Baby bestowed on the old bridle, which the
pony had carried off in its flight, and which, she observed, after
having lasted for eighteen years come Martinmas, might now be considered
as a castaway thing. Finding she had thus the field to herself, the old
lady launched forth into a lecture upon economy, according to her own
idea of that virtue, which seemed to include a system of privations,
which, though observed with the sole purpose of saving money, might, if
undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> upon other principles, have ranked high in the history of a
religious ascetic.</p>
<p>She was but little interrupted by Mordaunt, who, conscious he was now on
the eve of approaching Burgh-Westra, employed himself rather in the task
of anticipating the nature of the reception he was about to meet with
there from two beautiful young women, than with the prosing of an old
one, however wisely she might prove that small-beer was more wholesome
than strong ale, and that if her brother had bruised his ankle bone in
his tumble, cumfrey and butter was better to bring him round again, than
all the doctor’s drugs in the world.</p>
<p>But now the dreary moorlands, over which their path had hitherto lain,
were exchanged for a more pleasant prospect, opening on a salt-water
lake, or arm of the sea, which ran up far inland, and was surrounded by
flat and fertile ground, producing crops better than the experienced eye
of Triptolemus Yellowley had as yet witnessed in Zetland. In the midst
of this Goshen stood the mansion of Burgh-Westra, screened from the
north and east by a ridge of heathy hills which lay behind it, and
commanding an interesting prospect of the lake and its parent ocean, as
well as the islands, and more distant mountains. From the mansion
itself, as well as from almost every cottage in the adjacent hamlet,
arose such a rich cloud of vapoury smoke, as showed, that the
preparations for the festival were not confined to the principal
residence of Magnus himself, but extended through the whole vicinage.</p>
<p>“My certie,” said Mrs. Baby Yellowley, “ane wad think the haill town was
on fire! The very hill-side smells of their wastefulness, and a hungry
heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> wad scarce seek better kitchen<a id="FNanchor_39_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_47">[39]</a> to a barley scone, than just

</p>
<p>If the smell which was wafted from the chimneys of Burgh-Westra up to
the barren hills by which the mansion was surrounded, could, as Mistress
Barbara opined, have refreshed the hungry, the noise which proceeded
from thence might have given hearing to the deaf. It was a medley of all
sounds, and all connected with jollity and kind welcome. Nor were the
sights associated with them less animating.</p>
<p>Troops of friends were seen in the act of arriving—their dispersed
ponies flying to the moors in every direction, to recover their own
pastures in the best way they could;—such, as we have already said,
being the usual mode of discharging the cavalry which had been levied
for a day’s service. At a small but commodious harbour, connected with
the house and hamlet, those visitors were landing from their boats, who,
living in distant islands, and along the coast, had preferred making
their journey by sea. Mordaunt and his companions might see each party
pausing frequently to greet each other, and strolling on successively to
the house, whose ever open gate received them alternately in such
numbers, that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> seemed the extent of the mansion, though suited to the
opulence and hospitality of the owner, was scarce, on this occasion,
sufficient for the guests.</p>
<p>Among the confused sounds of mirth and welcome which arose at the
entrance of each new company, Mordaunt thought he could distinguish the
loud laugh and hearty salutation of the Sire of the mansion, and began
to feel more deeply than before, the anxious doubt, whether that cordial
reception, which was distributed so freely to all others, would be on
this occasion extended to him. As they came on, they heard the voluntary
scrapings and bravura effusions of the gallant fiddlers, who impatiently
flung already from their bows those sounds with which they were to
animate the evening. The clamour of the cook’s assistants, and the loud
scolding tones of the cook himself, were also to be heard—sounds of
dissonance at any other time, but which, subdued with others, and by
certain happy associations, form no disagreeable part of the full chorus
which always precedes a rural feast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the guests advanced, each full of their own thoughts.
Mordaunt’s we have already noticed. Baby was wrapt up in the melancholy
grief and surprise excited by the positive conviction, that so much
victuals had been cooked at once as were necessary to feed all the
mouths which were clamouring around her—an enormity of expense, which,
though she was no way concerned in bearing it, affected her nerves, as
the beholding a massacre would touch those of the most indifferent
spectator, however well assured of his own personal safety. She
sickened, in short, at the sight of so much extravagance, like
Abyssinian Bruce, when he saw the luckless minstrels of Gondar hacked to
pieces by the order of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> Ras Michael. As for her brother, they being now
arrived where the rude and antique instruments of Zetland agriculture
lay scattered in the usual confusion of a Scottish barn-yard, his
thoughts were at once engrossed in the deficiencies of the one-stilted
plough—of the <i>twiscar</i>, with which they dig peats—of the sledges, on
which they transport commodities—of all and every thing, in short, in
which the usages of the islands differed from those of the mainland of
Scotland. The sight of these imperfect instruments stirred the blood of
Triptolemus Yellowley, as that of the bold warrior rises at seeing the
arms and insignia of the enemy he is about to combat; and, faithful to
his high emprise, he thought less of the hunger which his journey had
occasioned, although about to be satisfied by such a dinner as rarely
fell to his lot, than upon the task which he had undertaken, of
civilizing the manners, and improving the cultivation, of Zetland.</p>
<p>“<i>Jacta est alea</i>,” he muttered to himself; “this very day shall prove
whether the Zetlanders are worthy of our labours, or whether their minds
are as incapable of cultivation as their peat-mosses. Yet let us be
cautious, and watch the soft time of speech. I feel, by my own
experience, that it were best to let the body, in its present state,
take the place of the mind. A mouthful of that same roast-beef, which
smells so delicately, will form an apt introduction to my grand plan for
improving the breed of stock.”</p>
<p>By this time the visitors had reached the low but ample front of Magnus
Troil’s residence, which seemed of various dates, with large and
ill-imagined additions, hastily adapted to the original building, as the
increasing estate, or enlarged family, of successive proprietors,
appeared to each to demand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> Beneath a low, broad, and large porch,
supported by two huge carved posts, once the head-ornaments of vessels
which had found shipwreck upon the coast, stood Magnus himself, intent
on the hospitable toil of receiving and welcoming the numerous guests
who successively approached. His strong portly figure was well adapted
to the dress which he wore—a blue coat of an antique cut, lined with
scarlet, and laced and looped with gold down the seams and button-holes,
and along the ample cuffs. Strong and masculine features, rendered ruddy
and brown by frequent exposure to severe weather—a quantity of most
venerable silver hair, which fell in unshorn profusion from under his
gold-laced hat, and was carelessly tied with a ribbon behind, expressed
at once his advanced age, his hasty, yet well-conditioned temper, and
his robust constitution. As our travellers approached him, a shade of
displeasure seemed to cross his brow, and to interrupt for an instant
the honest and hearty burst of hilarity with which he had been in the
act of greeting all prior arrivals. When he approached Triptolemus
Yellowley, he drew himself up, so as to mix, as it were, some share of
the stately importance of the opulent Udaller with the welcome afforded
by the frank and hospitable landlord.</p>
<p>“You are welcome, Mr. Yellowley,” was his address to the factor; “you
are welcome to Westra—the wind has blown you on a rough coast, and we
that are the natives must be kind to you as we can. This, I believe, is
your sister—Mistress Barbara Yellowley, permit me the honour of a
neighbourly salute.”—And so saying, with a daring and self-devoted
courtesy, which would find no equal in our degenerate days, he actually
ventured to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> salute the withered cheek of the spinster, who relaxed so
much of her usual peevishness of expression, as to receive the courtesy
with something which approached to a smile. He then looked full at
Mordaunt Mertoun, and without offering his hand, said, in a tone
somewhat broken by suppressed agitation, “You too are welcome, Master
Mordaunt.”</p>
<p>“Did I not think so,” said Mordaunt, naturally offended by the coldness
of his host’s manner, “I had not been here—and it is not yet too late
to turn back.”</p>
<p>“Young man,” replied Magnus, “you know better than most, that from these
doors no man can turn, without an offence to their owner. I pray you,
disturb not my guests by your ill-timed scruples. When Magnus Troil says
welcome, all are welcome who are within hearing of his voice, and it is
an indifferent loud one.—Walk on, my worthy guests, and let us see what
cheer my lasses can make you within doors.”</p>
<p>So saying, and taking care to make his manner so general to the whole
party, that Mordaunt should not be able to appropriate any particular
portion of the welcome to himself, nor yet to complain of being excluded
from all share in it, the Udaller ushered the guests into his house,
where two large outer rooms, which, on the present occasion, served the
purpose of a modern saloon, were already crowded with guests of every
description.</p>
<p>The furniture was sufficiently simple, and had a character peculiar to
the situation of those stormy islands. Magnus Troil was, indeed, like
most of the higher class of Zetland proprietors, a friend to the
distressed traveller, whether by sea or land, and had repeatedly exerted
his whole authority in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> protecting the property and persons of
shipwrecked mariners; yet so frequent were wrecks upon that tremendous
coast, and so many unappropriated articles were constantly flung ashore,
that the interior of the house bore sufficient witness to the ravages of
the ocean, and to the exercise of those rights which the lawyers term
<i>Flotsome and Jetsome</i>. The chairs, which were arranged around the
walls, were such as are used in cabins, and many of them were of foreign
construction; the mirrors and cabinets, which were placed against the
walls for ornament or convenience, had, it was plain from their form,
been constructed for ship-board, and one or two of the latter were of
strange and unknown wood. Even the partition which separated the two
apartments, seemed constructed out of the bulkhead of some large vessel,
clumsily adapted to the service which it at present performed, by the
labour of some native joiner. To a stranger, these evident marks and
tokens of human misery might, at the first glance, form a contrast with
the scene of mirth with which they were now associated; but the
association was so familiar to the natives, that it did not for a moment
interrupt the course of their glee.</p>
<p>To the younger part of these revellers the presence of Mordaunt was like
a fresh charm of enjoyment. All came around him to marvel at his
absence, and all, by their repeated enquiries, plainly showed that they
conceived it had been entirely voluntary on his side. The youth felt
that this general acceptation relieved his anxiety on one painful point.
Whatever prejudice the family of Burgh-Westra might have adopted
respecting him, it must be of a private nature; and at least he had not
the additional pain of finding that he was depreciated in the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
society at large; and his vindication, when he found opportunity to make
one, would not require to be extended beyond the circle of a single
family. This was consoling; though his heart still throbbed with anxiety
at the thought of meeting with his estranged, but still beloved friends.
Laying the excuse of his absence on his father’s state of health, he
made his way through the various groups of friends and guests, each of
whom seemed willing to detain him as long as possible, and having, by
presenting them to one or two families of consequence, got rid of his
travelling companions, who at first stuck fast as burs, he reached at
length the door of a small apartment, which, opening from one of the
large exterior rooms we have mentioned, Minna and Brenda had been
permitted to fit up after their own taste, and to call their peculiar
property.</p>
<p>Mordaunt had contributed no small share of the invention and mechanical
execution employed in fitting up this favourite apartment, and in
disposing its ornaments. It was, indeed, during his last residence at
Burgh-Westra, as free to his entrance and occupation, as to its proper
mistresses. But now, so much were times altered, that he remained with
his finger on the latch, uncertain whether he should take the freedom to
draw it, until Brenda’s voice pronounced the words, “Come in, then,” in
the tone of one who is interrupted by an unwelcome disturber, who is to
be heard and dispatched with all the speed possible.</p>
<p>At this signal Mertoun entered the fanciful cabinet of the sisters,
which by the addition of many ornaments, including some articles of
considerable value, had been fitted up for the approaching festival. The
daughters of Magnus, at the moment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> Mordaunt’s entrance, were seated
in deep consultation with the stranger Cleveland, and with a little
slight-made old man, whose eye retained all the vivacity of spirit,
which had supported him under the thousand vicissitudes of a changeful
and precarious life, and which, accompanying him in his old age,
rendered his grey hairs less awfully reverend perhaps, but not less
beloved, than would a more grave and less imaginative expression of
countenance and character. There was even a penetrating shrewdness
mingled in the look of curiosity, with which, as he stepped for an
instant aside, he seemed to watch the meeting of Mordaunt with the two
lovely sisters.</p>
<p>The reception the youth met with resembled, in general character, that
which he had experienced from Magnus himself; but the maidens could not
so well cover their sense of the change of circumstances under which
they met. Both blushed, as, rising, and without extending the hand, far
less offering the cheek, as the fashion of the times permitted, and
almost exacted, they paid to Mordaunt the salutation due to an ordinary
acquaintance. But the blush of the elder was one of those transient
evidences of flitting emotion, that vanish as fast as the passing
thought which excites them. In an instant she stood before the youth
calm and cold, returning, with guarded and cautious courtesy, the usual
civilities, which, with a faltering voice, Mordaunt endeavoured to
present to her. The emotion of Brenda bore, externally at least, a
deeper and more agitating character. Her blush extended over every part
of her beautiful skin which her dress permitted to be visible, including
her slender neck, and the upper region of a finely formed bosom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Neither did she even attempt to reply to what share of his confused
compliment Mordaunt addressed to her in particular, but regarded him
with eyes, in which displeasure was evidently mingled with feelings of
regret, and recollections of former times. Mordaunt felt, as it were,
assured upon the instant, that the regard of Minna was extinguished, but
that it might be yet possible to recover that of the milder Brenda; and
such is the waywardness of human fancy, that though he had never
hitherto made any distinct difference betwixt these two beautiful and
interesting girls, the favour of her, which seemed most absolutely
withdrawn, became at the moment the most interesting in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was disturbed in these hasty reflections by Cleveland, who advanced,
with military frankness, to pay his compliments to his preserver, having
only delayed long enough to permit the exchange of the ordinary
salutation betwixt the visitor and the ladies of the family. He made his
approach with so good a grace, that it was impossible for Mordaunt,
although he dated his loss of favour at Burgh-Westra from this
stranger’s appearance on the coast, and domestication in the family, to
do less than return his advances as courtesy demanded, accept his thanks
with an appearance of satisfaction, and hope that his time had past
pleasantly since their last meeting.</p>
<p>Cleveland was about to answer, when he was anticipated by the little old
man, formerly noticed, who now thrusting himself forward, and seizing
Mordaunt’s hand, kissed him on the forehead; and then at the same time
echoed and answered his question—“How passes time at Burgh-Westra? Was
it you that asked it, my prince of the cliff and of the scaur?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> How
should it pass, but with all the wings that beauty and joy can add to
help its flight!”</p>
<p>“And wit and song, too, my good old friend,” said Mordaunt,
half-serious, half-jesting, as he shook the old man cordially by the
hand.—“These cannot be wanting, where Claud Halcro comes!”</p>
<p>“Jeer me not, Mordaunt, my good lad,” replied the old man; “When your
foot is as slow as mine, your wit frozen, and your song out of tune”——</p>
<p>“How can you belie yourself, my good master?” answered Mordaunt, who was
not unwilling to avail himself of his old friend’s peculiarities to
introduce something like conversation, break the awkwardness of this
singular meeting, and gain time for observation, ere requiring an
explanation of the change of conduct which the family seemed to have
adopted towards him. “Say not so,” he continued. “Time, my old friend,
lays his hand lightly on the bard. Have I not heard you say, the poet
partakes the immortality of his song? and surely the great English poet,
you used to tell us of, was elder than yourself when he pulled the
bow-oar among all the wits of London.”</p>
<p>This alluded to a story which was, as the French term it, Halcro’s
<i>cheval de bataille</i>, and any allusion to which was certain at once to
place him in the saddle, and to push his hobby-horse into full career.</p>
<p>His laughing eye kindled with a sort of enthusiasm, which the ordinary
folk of this world might have called crazed, while he dashed into the
subject which he best loved to talk upon. “Alas, alas, my dear Mordaunt
Mertoun—silver is silver, and waxes not dim by use—and pewter is
pewter, and grows the longer the duller. It is not for poor Claud Halcro
to name himself in the same twelvemonth with the immortal John Dryden.
True it is, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> may have told you before, that I have seen that great
man, nay I have been in the Wits’ Coffeehouse, as it was then called,
and had once a pinch out of his own very snuff-box. I must have told you
all how it happened, but here is Captain Cleveland who never heard
it.—I lodged, you must know, in Russel Street—I question not but you
know Russel Street, Covent Garden, Captain Cleveland?”</p>
<p>“I should know its latitude pretty well, Mr. Halcro,” said the Captain,
smiling; “but I believe you mentioned the circumstance yesterday, and
besides we have the day’s duty in hand—you must play us this song which
we are to study.”</p>
<p>“It will not serve the turn now,” said Halcro, “we must think of
something that will take in our dear Mordaunt, the first voice in the
island, whether for a part or solo. I will never be he will touch a
string to you, unless Mordaunt Mertoun is to help us out.—What say you,
my fairest Night?—what think you, my sweet Dawn of Day?” he added,
addressing the young women, upon whom, as we have said elsewhere, he had
long before bestowed these allegorical names.</p>
<p>“Mr. Mordaunt Mertoun,” said Minna, “has come too late to be of our band
on this occasion—it is our misfortune, but it cannot be helped.”</p>
<p>“How? what?” said Halcro, hastily—“too late—and you have practised
together all your lives? take my word, my bonny lasses, that old tunes
are sweetest, and old friends surest. Mr. Cleveland has a fine bass,
that must be allowed; but I would have you trust for the first effect to
one of the twenty fine airs you can sing where Mordaunt’s tenor joins so
well with your own witchery—here is my lovely Day approves of the
change in her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“You were never in your life more mistaken, father Halcro,” said Brenda,
her cheeks again reddening, more with displeasure, it seemed, than with
shame.</p>
<p>“Nay, but how is this?” said the old man, pausing, and looking at them
alternately. “What have we got here?—a cloudy night and a red
morning?—that betokens rough weather.—What means all this, young
women?—where lies the offence?—In me, I fear; for the blame is always
laid upon the oldest when young folk like you go by the ears.”</p>
<p>“The blame is not with you, father Halcro,” said Minna, rising, and
taking her sister by the arm, “if indeed there be blame anywhere.”</p>
<p>“I should fear then, Minna,” said Mordaunt, endeavouring to soften his
tone into one of indifferent pleasantry, “that the new comer has brought
the offence along with him.”</p>
<p>“When no offence is taken,” replied Minna, with her usual gravity, “it
matters not by whom such may have been offered.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible, Minna!” exclaimed Mordaunt, “and is it you who speak
thus to me?—And you too, Brenda, can you too judge so hardly of me, yet
without permitting me one moment of honest and frank explanation?”</p>
<p>“Those who should know best,” answered Brenda, in a low but decisive
tone of voice, “have told us their pleasure, and it must be
done.—Sister, I think we have staid too long here, and shall be wanted
elsewhere—Mr. Mertoun will excuse us on so busy a day.”</p>
<p>The sisters linked their arms together. Halcro in vain endeavoured to
stop them, making, at the same time, a theatrical gesture, and
exclaiming,</p>
<p class="center">“Now, Day and Night, but this is wondrous strange!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Then turned to Mordaunt Mertoun, and added—“The girls are possessed
with the spirit of mutability, showing, as our master Spenser well
saith, that</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘Among all living creatures, more or lesse,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Change still doth reign, and keep the greater sway.’</span><br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">Captain Cleveland,” he continued, “know you any thing that has happened
to put these two juvenile Graces out of tune?”</p>
<p>“He will lose his reckoning,” answered Cleveland, “that spends time in
enquiring why the wind shifts a point, or why a woman changes her mind.
Were I Mr. Mordaunt, I would not ask the proud wenches another question
on such a subject.”</p>
<p>“It is a friendly advice, Captain Cleveland,” replied Mordaunt, “and I
will not hold it the less so that it has been given unasked. Allow me to
enquire if you are yourself as indifferent to the opinion of your female
friends, as it seems you would have me to be?”</p>
<p>“Who, I?” said the Captain, with an air of frank indifference, “I never
thought twice upon such a subject. I never saw a woman worth thinking
twice about after the anchor was a-peak—on shore it is another thing;
and I will laugh, sing, dance, and make love, if they like it, with
twenty girls, were they but half so pretty as those who have left us,
and make them heartily welcome to change their course in the sound of a
boatswain’s whistle. It will be odds but I wear as fast as they can.”</p>
<p>A patient is seldom pleased with that sort of consolation which is
founded on holding light the malady of which he complains; and Mordaunt
felt disposed to be offended with Captain Cleveland, both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> for taking
notice of his embarrassment, and intruding upon him his own opinion; and
he replied, therefore, somewhat sharply, “that Captain Cleveland’s
sentiments were only suited to such as had the art to become universal
favourites wherever chance happened to throw them, and who could not
lose in one place more than their merit was sure to gain for them in
another.”</p>
<p>This was spoken ironically; but there was, to confess the truth, a
superior knowledge of the world, and a consciousness of external merit
at least, about the man, which rendered his interference doubly
disagreeable. As Sir Lucius O’Trigger says, there was an air of success
about Captain Cleveland which was mighty provoking. Young, handsome, and
well assured, his air of nautical bluntness sat naturally and easily
upon him, and was perhaps particularly well fitted to the simple manners
of the remote country in which he found himself; and where, even in the
best families, a greater degree of refinement might have rendered his
conversation rather less acceptable. He was contented, in the present
instance, to smile good-humouredly at the obvious discontent of Mordaunt
Mertoun, and replied, “You are angry with me, my good friend, but you
cannot make me angry with you. The fair hands of all the pretty women I
ever saw in my life would never have fished me up out of the Roost of
Sumburgh. So, pray, do not quarrel with me; for here is Mr. Halcro
witness that I have struck both jack and topsail, and should you fire a
broadside into me, cannot return a single shot.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said Halcro, “you must be friends with Captain Cleveland,
Mordaunt. Never quarrel with your friend, because a woman is whimsical.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Why, man, if they kept one humour, how the devil could we make so many
songs on them as we do? Even old Dryden himself, glorious old John,
could have said little about a girl that was always of one mind—as well
write verses upon a mill-pond. It is your tides and your roosts, and
your currents and eddies, that come and go, and ebb and flow, (by
Heaven! I run into rhyme when I so much as think upon them,) that smile
one day, rage the next, flatter and devour, delight and ruin us, and so
forth—it is these that give the real soul of poetry. Did you never hear
my Adieu to the Lass of Northmaven—that was poor Bet Stimbister, whom I
call Mary for the sound’s sake, as I call myself Hacon after my great
ancestor Hacon Goldemund, or Haco with the golden mouth, who came to the
island with Harold Harfager, and was his chief Scald?—Well, but where
was I?—O ay—poor Bet Stimbister, she (and partly some debt) was the
cause of my leaving the isles of Hialtland, (better so called than
Shetland, or Zetland even,) and taking to the broad world. I have had a
tramp of it since that time—I have battled my way through the world,
Captain, as a man of mold may, that has a light head, a light purse, and
a heart as light as them both—fought my way, and paid my way—that is,
either with money or wit—have seen kings changed and deposed as you
would turn a tenant out of a scathold—knew all the wits of the age, and
especially the glorious John Dryden—what man in the islands can say as
much, barring lying?—I had a pinch out of his own snuff-box—I will
tell you how I came by such promotion.”</p>
<p>“But the song, Mr. Halcro,” said Captain Cleveland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>“The song?” answered Halcro, seizing the Captain by the button,—for he
was too much accustomed to have his audience escape from him during
recitation, not to put in practice all the usual means of
prevention,—“The song? Why I gave a copy of it, with fifteen others, to
the immortal John. You shall hear it—you shall hear them all, if you
will but stand still a moment; and you too, my dear boy, Mordaunt
Mertoun, I have scarce heard a word from your mouth these six months,
and now you are running away from me.” So saying, he secured him with
his other hand.</p>
<p>“Nay, now he has got us both in tow,” said the seaman, “there is nothing
for it but hearing him out, though he spins as tough a yarn as ever an
old man-of-war’s-man twisted on the watch at midnight.”</p>
<p>“Nay, now, be silent, be silent, and let one of us speak at once,” said
the poet, imperatively; while Cleveland and Mordaunt, looking at each
other with a ludicrous expression of resignation to their fate, waited
in submission for the well-known and inevitable tale. “I will tell you
all about it,” continued Halcro. “I was knocked about the world like
other young fellows, doing this, that, and t’other for a livelihood;
for, thank God, I could turn my hand to any thing—but loving still the
Muses as much as if the ungrateful jades had found me, like so many
blockheads, in my own coach and six. However, I held out till my cousin,
old Lawrence Linkletter, died, and left me the bit of an island yonder;
although, by the way, Cultmalindie was as near to him as I was; but
Lawrence loved wit, though he had little of his own. Well, he left me
the wee bit island—it is as barren as Parnassus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> itself. What then?—I
have a penny to spend, a penny to keep my purse, a penny to give to the
poor—ay, and a bed and a bottle for a friend, as you shall know, boys,
if you will go back with me when this merriment is over.—But where was
I in my story?”</p>
<p>“Near port, I hope,” answered Cleveland; but Halcro was too determined a
narrator to be interrupted by the broadest hint.</p>
<p>“O ay,” he resumed, with the self-satisfied air of one who has recovered
the thread of a story, “I was in my old lodgings in Russel Street, with
old Timothy Thimblethwaite, the Master Fashioner, then the best-known
man about town. He made for all the wits, and for the dull boobies of
fortune besides, and made the one pay for the other. He never denied a
wit credit save in jest, or for the sake of getting a repartee; and he
was in correspondence with all that was worth knowing about town. He had
letters from Crowne, and Tate, and Prior, and Tom Brown, and all the
famous fellows of the time, with such pellets of wit, that there was no
reading them without laughing ready to die, and all ending with craving
a further term for payment.”</p>
<p>“I should have thought the tailor would have found that jest rather
serious,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Not a bit—not a bit,” replied his eulogist, “Tim Thimblethwaite (he
was a Cumberland-man by birth) had the soul of a prince—ay, and died
with the fortune of one; for woe betide the custard-gorged alderman that
came under Tim’s goose, after he had got one of those letters—egad, he
was sure to pay the kain! Why, Thimblethwaite was thought to be the
original of little Tom Bibber, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> glorious John’s comedy of the Wild
Gallant; and I know that he has trusted, ay, and lent John money to boot
out of his own pocket, at a time when all his fine court friends blew
cold enough. He trusted me too, and I have been two months on the score
at a time for my upper room. To be sure, I was obliging in his way—not
that I exactly could shape or sew, nor would that have been decorous for
a gentleman of good descent; but I—eh, eh—I drew bills—summed up the
books”——</p>
<p>“Carried home the clothes of the wits and aldermen, and got lodging for
your labour?” interrupted Cleveland.</p>
<p>“No, no—damn it, no,” replied Halcro; “no such thing—you put me out in
my story—where was I?”</p>
<p>“Nay, the devil help you to the latitude,” said the Captain, extricating
his button from the gripe of the unmerciful bard’s finger and thumb,
“for I have no time to take an observation.” So saying, he bolted from
the room.</p>
<p>“A silly, ill-bred, conceited fool,” said Halcro, looking after him;
“with as little manners as wit in his empty coxcomb. I wonder what
Magnus and these silly wenches can see in him—he tells such damnable
long-winded stories, too, about his adventures and sea-fights—every
second word a lie, I doubt not. Mordaunt, my dear boy, take example by
that man—that is, take warning by him—never tell long stories about
yourself. You are sometimes given to talk too much about your own
exploits on crags and skerries, and the like, which only breaks
conversation, and prevents other folk from being heard. Now I see you
are impatient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> to hear out what I was saying—Stop, whereabouts was I?”</p>
<p>“I fear we must put it off, Mr. Halcro, until after dinner,” said
Mordaunt, who also meditated his escape, though desirous of effecting it
with more delicacy towards his old acquaintance than Captain Cleveland
had thought it necessary to use.</p>
<p>“Nay, my dear boy,” said Halcro, seeing himself about to be utterly
deserted, “do not you leave me too—never take so bad an example as to
set light by old acquaintance, Mordaunt. I have wandered many a weary
step in my day; but they were always lightened when I could get hold of
the arm of an old friend like yourself.”</p>
<p>So saying, he quitted the youth’s coat, and sliding his hand gently
under his arm, grappled him more effectually; to which Mordaunt
submitted, a little moved by the poet’s observation upon the unkindness
of old acquaintances, under which he himself was an immediate sufferer.
But when Halcro renewed his formidable question, “Whereabouts was I?”
Mordaunt, preferring his poetry to his prose, reminded him of the song
which he said he had written upon his first leaving Zetland,—a song to
which, indeed, the enquirer was no stranger, but which, as it must be
new to the reader, we shall here insert as a favourable specimen of the
poetical powers of this tuneful descendant of Haco the Golden-mouthed;
for, in the opinion of many tolerable judges, he held a respectable rank
among the inditers of madrigals of the period, and was as well qualified
to give immortality to his Nancies of the hills or dales, as many a
gentle sonnetteer of wit and pleasure about town. He was something of a
musician also, and on the present occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> seized upon a sort of lute,
and, quitting his victim, prepared the instrument for an accompaniment,
speaking all the while that he might lose no time.</p>
<p>“I learned the lute,” he said, “from the same man who taught honest
Shadwell—plump Tom, as they used to call him—somewhat roughly treated
by the glorious John, you remember—Mordaunt, you remember—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘Methinks I see the new Arion sail,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lute still trembling underneath thy nail;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At thy well sharpen’d thumb, from shore to shore,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The trebles squeak for fear, the basses roar.’</span><br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">Come, I am indifferently in tune now—what was it to be?—ay, I
remember—nay, The Lass of Northmaven is the ditty—poor Bet Stimbister!
I have called her Mary in the verses. Betsy does well for an English
song; but Mary is more natural here.” So saying, after a short prelude,
he sung, with a tolerable voice and some taste, the following verses:</p>
<h3>MARY.</h3>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell to Northmaven,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grey Hillswicke, farewell!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the calms of thy haven,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The storms on thy fell—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To each breeze that can vary</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The mood of thy main,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to thee, bonny Mary!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We meet not again.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell the wild ferry,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which Hacon could brave,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the peaks of the Skerry</span><br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were white in the wave.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There’s a maid may look over</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These wild waves in vain—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the skiff of her lover—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He comes not again.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vows thou hast broke,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the wild currents fling them;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the quicksand and rock</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let the mermaidens sing them.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New sweetness they’ll give her</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bewildering strain;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But there’s one who will never</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Believe them again.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O were there an island,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though ever so wild,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where woman could smile, and</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No man be beguiled—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too tempting a snare</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To poor mortals were given,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the hope would fix there,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That should anchor on heaven!</span><br>
</p>
<p>“I see you are softened, my young friend,” said Halcro, when he had
finished his song; “so are most who hear that same ditty. Words and
music both mine own; and, without saying much of the wit of it, there is
a sort of eh—eh—simplicity and truth about it, which gets its way to
most folk’s heart. Even your father cannot resist it—and he has a heart
as impenetrable to poetry and song as Apollo himself could draw an arrow
against. But then he has had some ill luck in his time with the
women-folk, as is plain from his owing them such a grudge—Ay, ay, there
the charm lies—none of us but has felt the same sore in our day. But
come, my dear boy, they are mustering in the hall, men and women
both—plagues as they are, we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> get on ill without them—but
before we go, only mark the last turn—</p>
<p class="center">‘And the hope would fix there,’—</p>
<p class="noidt">that is, in the supposed island—a place which neither was nor will be—</p>
<p class="center">‘That should anchor on heaven.’</p>
<p class="noidt">Now you see, my good young man, there are here none of your heathenish
rants, which Rochester, Etheridge, and these wild fellows, used to
string together. A parson might sing the song, and his clerk bear the
burden—but there is the confounded bell—we must go now—but never
mind—we’ll get into a quiet corner at night, and I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full in the midst the polish’d table shines,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bright goblets, rich with generous wines;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Portions the food, and each the portion shares;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor till the rage of thirst and hunger ceased,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the high host approach’d the sagacious guest.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Odyssey.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The hospitable profusion of Magnus Troil’s board, the number of guests
who feasted in the hall, the much greater number of retainers,
attendants, humble friends, and domestics of every possible description,
who revelled without, with the multitude of the still poorer, and less
honoured assistants, who came from every hamlet or township within
twenty miles round, to share the bounty of the munificent Udaller, were
such as altogether astonished Triptolemus Yellowley, and made him
internally doubt whether it would be prudent in him at this time, and
amid the full glow of his hospitality, to propose to the host who
presided over such a splendid banquet, a radical change in the whole
customs and usages of his country.</p>
<p>True, the sagacious Triptolemus felt conscious that he possessed in his
own person wisdom far superior to that of all the assembled feasters, to
say nothing of the landlord, against whose prudence the very extent of
his hospitality formed, in Yellowley’s opinion, sufficient evidence. But
yet the Amphi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tryon with whom one dines, holds, for the time at least,
an influence over the minds of his most distinguished guests; and if the
dinner be in good style and the wines of the right quality, it is
humbling to see that neither art nor wisdom, scarce external rank
itself, can assume their natural and wonted superiority over the
distributor of these good things, until coffee has been brought in.
Triptolemus felt the full weight of this temporary superiority, yet he
was desirous to do something that might vindicate the vaunts he had made
to his sister and his fellow-traveller, and he stole a look at them from
time to time, to mark whether he was not sinking in their esteem from
postponing his promised lecture on the enormities of Zetland.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Barbara was busily engaged in noting and registering the waste
incurred in such an entertainment as she had probably never before
looked upon, and in admiring the host’s indifference to, and the guests’
absolute negligence of, those rules of civility in which her youth had
been brought up. The feasters desired to be helped from a dish which was
unbroken, and might have figured at supper, with as much freedom as if
it had undergone the ravages of half-a-dozen guests; and no one seemed
to care—the landlord himself least of all—whether those dishes only
were consumed, which, from their nature, were incapable of
re-appearance, or whether the assault was extended to the substantial
rounds of beef, pasties, and so forth, which, by the rules of good
housewifery, were destined to stand two attacks, and which, therefore,
according to Mrs. Barbara’s ideas of politeness, ought not to have been
annihilated by the guests upon the first onset, but spared, like Outis
in the cave of Polyphemus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> to be devoured the last. Lost in the
meditations to which these breaches of convivial discipline gave rise,
and in the contemplation of an ideal larder of cold meat which she could
have saved out of the wreck of roast, boiled, and baked, sufficient to
have supplied her cupboard for at least a twelvemonth, Mrs. Barbara
cared very little whether or not her brother supported in its extent the
character which he had calculated upon assuming.</p>
<p>Mordaunt Mertoun also was conversant with far other thoughts, than those
which regarded the proposed reformer of Zetland enormities. His seat was
betwixt two blithe maidens of Thule, who, not taking scorn that he had
upon other occasions given preference to the daughters of the Udaller,
were glad of the chance which assigned to them the attentions of so
distinguished a gallant, who, as being their squire at the feast, might
in all probability become their partner in the subsequent dance. But,
whilst rendering to his fair neighbours all the usual attentions which
society required, Mordaunt kept up a covert, but accurate and close
observation, upon his estranged friends, Minna and Brenda. The Udaller
himself had a share of his attention; but in him he could remark
nothing, except the usual tone of hearty and somewhat boisterous
hospitality, with which he was accustomed to animate the banquet upon
all such occasions of general festivity. But in the differing mien of
the two maidens there was much more room for painful remark.</p>
<p>Captain Cleveland sat betwixt the sisters, was sedulous in his
attentions to both, and Mordaunt was so placed, that he could observe
all, and hear a great deal, of what passed between them. But Cleveland’s
peculiar regard seemed devoted to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> elder sister. Of this the younger
was perhaps conscious, for more than once her eye glanced towards
Mordaunt, and, as he thought, with something in it which resembled
regret for the interruption of their intercourse, and a sad remembrance
of former and more friendly times; while Minna was exclusively engrossed
by the attentions of her neighbour; and that it should be so, filled
Mordaunt with surprise and resentment.</p>
<p>Minna, the serious, the prudent, the reserved, whose countenance and
manners indicated so much elevation of character—Minna, the lover of
solitude, and of those paths of knowledge in which men walk best without
company—the enemy of light mirth, the friend of musing melancholy, and
the frequenter of fountain-heads and pathless glens—she whose character
seemed, in short, the very reverse of that which might be captivated by
the bold, coarse, and daring gallantry of such a man as this Captain
Cleveland, gave, nevertheless, her eye and ear to him, as he sat beside
her at table, with an interest and a graciousness of attention, which,
to Mordaunt, who well knew how to judge of her feelings by her manner,
intimated a degree of the highest favour. He observed this, and his
heart rose against the favourite by whom he had been thus superseded, as
well as against Minna’s indiscreet departure from her own character.</p>
<p>“What is there about the man,” he said within himself, “more than the
bold and daring assumption of importance which is derived from success
in petty enterprises, and the exercise of petty despotism over a ship’s
crew?—His very language is more professional than is used by the
superior officers of the British navy; and the wit which has excited so
many smiles, seems to me such as Minna would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> not formerly have endured
for an instant. Even Brenda seems less taken with his gallantry than
Minna, whom it should have suited so little.”</p>
<p>Mordaunt was doubly mistaken in these his angry speculations. In the
first place, with an eye which was, in some respects, that of a rival,
he criticised far too severely the manners and behaviour of Captain
Cleveland. They were unpolished, certainly; which was of the less
consequence in a country inhabited by so plain and simple a race as the
ancient Zetlanders. On the other hand, there was an open, naval
frankness in Cleveland’s bearing—much natural shrewdness—some
appropriate humour—an undoubting confidence in himself—and that
enterprising hardihood of disposition, which, without any other
recommendable quality, very often leads to success with the fair sex.
But Mordaunt was farther mistaken, in supposing that Cleveland was
likely to be disagreeable to Minna Troil, on account of the opposition
of their characters in so many material particulars. Had his knowledge
of the world been a little more extensive, he might have observed, that
as unions are often formed betwixt couples differing in complexion and
stature, they take place still more frequently betwixt persons totally
differing in feelings, in taste, in pursuits, and in understanding; and
it would not be saying, perhaps, too much, to aver, that two-thirds of
the marriages around us have been contracted betwixt persons, who,
judging <i>a priori</i>, we should have thought had scarce any charms for
each other.</p>
<p>A moral and primary cause might be easily assigned for these anomalies,
in the wise dispensations of Providence, that the general balance of
wit, wisdom, and amiable qualities of all kinds, should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> kept up
through society at large. For, what a world were it, if the wise were to
intermarry only with the wise, the learned with the learned, the amiable
with the amiable, nay, even the handsome with the handsome? and, is it
not evident, that the degraded castes of the foolish, the ignorant, the
brutal, and the deformed, (comprehending, by the way, far the greater
portion of mankind,) must, when condemned to exclusive intercourse with
each other, become gradually as much brutalized in person and
disposition as so many ourang-outangs? When, therefore, we see the
“gentle joined to the rude,” we may lament the fate of the suffering
individual, but we must not the less admire the mysterious disposition
of that wise Providence which thus balances the moral good and evil of
life;—which secures for a family, unhappy in the dispositions of one
parent, a share of better and sweeter blood, transmitted from the other,
and preserves to the offspring the affectionate care and protection of
at least one of those from whom it is naturally due. Without the
frequent occurrence of such alliances and unions—mis-sorted as they
seem at first sight—the world could not be that for which Eternal
Wisdom has designed it—a place of mixed good and evil—a place of trial
at once, and of suffering, where even the worst ills are checkered with
something that renders them tolerable to humble and patient minds, and
where the best blessings carry with them a necessary alloy of
embittering depreciation.</p>
<p>When, indeed, we look a little closer on the causes of those unexpected
and ill-suited attachments, we have occasion to acknowledge, that the
means by which they are produced do not infer that complete departure
from, or inconsistency with, the character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> of the parties, which we
might expect when the result alone is contemplated. The wise purposes
which Providence appears to have had in view, by permitting such
intermixture of dispositions, tempers, and understandings, in the
married state, are not accomplished by any mysterious impulse by which,
in contradiction to the ordinary laws of nature, men or women are urged
to an union with those whom the world see to be unsuitable to them. The
freedom of will is permitted to us in the occurrences of ordinary life,
as in our moral conduct; and in the former as well as the latter case,
is often the means of misguiding those who possess it. Thus it usually
happens, more especially to the enthusiastic and imaginative, that,
having formed a picture of admiration in their own mind, they too often
deceive themselves by some faint resemblance in some existing being,
whom their fancy, as speedily as gratuitously, invests with all the
attributes necessary to complete the <i>beau ideal</i> of mental perfection.
No one, perhaps, even in the happiest marriage, with an object really
beloved, ever discovered by experience all the qualities he expected to
possess; but in far too many cases, he finds he has practised a much
higher degree of mental deception, and has erected his airy castle of
felicity upon some rainbow, which owed its very existence only to the
peculiar state of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Thus, Mordaunt, if better acquainted with life, and with the course of
human things, would have been little surprised that such a man as
Cleveland, handsome, bold, and animated,—a man who had obviously lived
in danger, and who spoke of it as sport, should have been invested, by a
girl of Minna’s fanciful disposition, with an extensive share of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
qualities, which, in her active imagination, were held to fill up the
accomplishments of a heroic character. The plain bluntness of his
manner, if remote from courtesy, appeared at least as widely different
from deceit; and, unfashioned as he seemed by forms, he had enough both
of natural sense, and natural good-breeding, to support the delusion he
had created, at least as far as externals were concerned. It is scarce
necessary to add, that these observations apply exclusively to what are
called love-matches; for when either party fix their attachment upon the
substantial comforts of a rental, or a jointure, they cannot be
disappointed in the acquisition, although they may be cruelly so in
their over-estimation of the happiness it was to afford, or in having
too slightly anticipated the disadvantages with which it was to be
attended.</p>
<p>Having a certain partiality for the dark Beauty whom we have described,
we have willingly dedicated this digression, in order to account for a
line of conduct which we allow to seem absolutely unnatural in such a
narrative as the present, though the most common event in ordinary life;
namely, in Minna’s appearing to have over-estimated the taste, talent,
and ability of a handsome young man, who was dedicating to her his whole
time and attention, and whose homage rendered her the envy of almost all
the other young women of that numerous party. Perhaps, if our fair
readers will take the trouble to consult their own bosoms, they will be
disposed to allow, that the distinguished good taste exhibited by any
individual, who, when his attentions would be agreeable to a whole
circle of rivals, selects <i>one</i> as their individual object, entitles
him, on the footing of reciprocity, if on no other, to a large share of
that individual’s favourable, and even partial, esteem. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> any rate, if
the character shall, after all, be deemed inconsistent and unnatural, it
concerns not us, who record the facts as we find them, and pretend no
privilege for bringing closer to nature those incidents which may seem
to diverge from it; or for reducing to consistence that most
inconsistent of all created things—the heart of a beautiful and admired
female.</p>
<p>Necessity, which teaches all the liberal arts, can render us also adepts
in dissimulation; and Mordaunt, though a novice, failed not to profit in
her school. It was manifest, that, in order to observe the demeanour of
those on whom his attention was fixed, he must needs put constraint on
his own, and appear, at least, so much engaged with the damsels betwixt
whom he sat, that Minna and Brenda should suppose him indifferent to
what was passing around him. The ready cheerfulness of Maddie and Clara
Groatsettars, who were esteemed considerable fortunes in the island, and
were at this moment too happy in feeling themselves seated somewhat
beyond the sphere of vigilance influenced by their aunt, the good old
Lady Glowrowrum, met and requited the attempts which Mordaunt made to be
lively and entertaining; and they were soon engaged in a gay
conversation, to which, as usual on such occasions, the gentleman
contributed wit, or what passes for such, and the ladies their prompt
laughter and liberal applause. But, amidst this seeming mirth, Mordaunt
failed not, from time to time, as covertly as he might, to observe the
conduct of the two daughters of Magnus; and still it appeared as if the
elder, wrapt up in the conversation of Cleveland, did not cast away a
thought on the rest of the company; and as if Brenda, more openly as she
conceived his attention withdrawn from her, looked with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> expression
both anxious and melancholy towards the group of which he himself formed
a part. He was much moved by the diffidence, as well as the trouble,
which her looks seemed to convey, and tacitly formed the resolution of
seeking a more full explanation with her in the course of the evening.
Norna, he remembered, had stated that these two amiable young women were
in danger, the nature of which she left unexplained, but which he
suspected to arise out of their mistaking the character of this daring
and all-engrossing stranger; and he secretly resolved, that, if
possible, he would be the means of detecting Cleveland, and of saving
his early friends.</p>
<p>As he revolved these thoughts, his attention to the Miss Groatsettars
gradually diminished, and perhaps he might altogether have forgotten the
necessity of his appearing an uninterested spectator of what was
passing, had not the signal been given for the ladies retiring from
table. Minna, with a native grace, and somewhat of stateliness in her
manner, bent her head to the company in general, with a kinder and more
particular expression as her eye reached Cleveland. Brenda, with the
blush which attended her slightest personal exertion when exposed to the
eyes of others, hurried through the same departing salutation with an
embarrassment which almost amounted to awkwardness, but which her youth
and timidity rendered at once natural and interesting. Again Mordaunt
thought that her eye distinguished him amidst the numerous company. For
the first time he ventured to encounter and to return the glance; and
the consciousness that he had done so doubled the glow of Brenda’s
countenance, while something resembling displeasure was blended with her
emotion.</p>
<p>When the ladies had retired, the men betook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> themselves to the deep and
serious drinking, which, according to the fashion of the times, preceded
the evening exercise of the dance. Old Magnus himself, by precept and
example, exhorted them “to make the best use of their time, since the
ladies would soon summon them to shake their feet.” At the same time
giving the signal to a grey-headed domestic, who stood behind him in the
dress of a Dantzic skipper, and who added to many other occupations that
of butler, “Eric Scambester,” he said, “has the good ship the Jolly
Mariner of Canton, got her cargo on board?”</p>
<p>“Chokeful loaded,” answered the Ganymede of Burgh-Westra, “with good
Nantz, Jamaica sugar, Portugal lemons, not to mention nutmeg and toast,
and water taken in from the Shellicoat spring.”</p>
<p>Loud and long laughed the guests at this stated and regular jest betwixt
the Udaller and his butler, which always served as a preface to the
introduction of a punch-bowl of enormous size, the gift of the captain
of one of the Honourable East India Company’s vessels, which, bound from
China homeward, had been driven north-about by stress of weather into
Lerwick-bay, and had there contrived to get rid of part of the cargo,
without very scrupulously reckoning for the King’s duties.</p>
<p>Magnus Troil, having been a large customer, besides otherwise obliging
Captain Coolie, had been remunerated, on the departure of the ship, with
this splendid vehicle of conviviality, at the very sight of which, as
old Eric Scambester bent under its weight, a murmur of applause ran
through the company. The good old toasts dedicated to the prosperity of
Zetland, were then honoured with flowing bumpers. “Death to the head
that never wears hair!” was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> sentiment quaffed to the success of the
fishing, as proposed by the sonorous voice of the Udaller. Claud Halcro
proposed with general applause, “The health of their worthy landmaster,
the sweet sister meat-mistresses; health to man, death to fish, and
growth to the produce of the ground.” The same recurring sentiment was
proposed more concisely by a whiteheaded compeer of Magnus Troil, in the
words, “God open the mouth of the grey fish, and keep his hand about the
corn!”<a id="FNanchor_40_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_48">[40]</a></p>
<p>Full opportunity was afforded to all to honour these interesting toasts.
Those nearest the capacious Mediterranean of punch, were accommodated by
the Udaller with their portions, dispensed in huge rummer glasses by his
own hospitable hand, whilst they who sat at a greater distance
replenished their cups by means of a rich silver flagon, facetiously
called the Pinnace; which, filled occasionally at the bowl, served to
dispense its liquid treasures to the more remote parts of the table, and
occasioned many right merry jests on its frequent voyages. The commerce
of the Zetlanders with foreign vessels, and homeward-bound West
Indiamen, had early served to introduce among them the general use of
the generous beverage, with which the Jolly Mariner of Canton was
loaded; nor was there a man in the archipelago of Thule more skilled in
combining its rich ingredients, than old Eric Scambester, who indeed was
known far and wide through the isles by the name of the Punch-maker,
after the fashion of the ancient Norwegians, who conferred on Rollo the
Walker, and other heroes of their strain, epithets expressive of the
feats of strength or dexterity in which they excelled all other men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>The good liquor was not slow in performing its office of exhilaration,
and, as the revel advanced, some ancient Norse drinking-songs were sung
with great effect by the guests, tending to show, that if, from want of
exercise, the martial virtues of their ancestors had decayed among the
Zetlanders, they could still actively and intensely enjoy so much of the
pleasures of Valhalla as consisted in quaffing the oceans of mead and
brown ale, which were promised by Odin to those who should share his
Scandinavian paradise. At length, excited by the cup and song, the
diffident grew bold, and the modest loquacious—all became desirous of
talking, and none were willing to listen—each man mounted his own
special hobby-horse, and began eagerly to call on his neighbours to
witness his agility. Amongst others, the little bard, who had now got
next to our friend Mordaunt Mertoun, evinced a positive determination to
commence and conclude, in all its longitude and latitude, the story of
his introduction to glorious John Dryden; and Triptolemus Yellowley, as
his spirits arose, shaking off a feeling of involuntary awe, with which
he was impressed by the opulence indicated in all he saw around him, as
well as by the respect paid to Magnus Troil by the assembled guests,
began to broach, to the astonished and somewhat offended Udaller, some
of those projects for ameliorating the islands, which he had boasted of
to his fellow-travellers upon their journey of the morning.</p>
<p>But the innovations which he suggested, and the reception which they met
with at the hand of Magnus Troil, must be told in the next Chapter.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Old Play.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>We left the company of Magnus Troil engaged in high wassail and revelry.
Mordaunt, who, like his father, shunned the festive cup, did not partake
in the cheerfulness which the ship diffused among the guests as they
unloaded it, and the pinnace, as it circumnavigated the table. But, in
low spirits as he seemed, he was the more meet prey for the
story-telling Halcro, who had fixed upon him, as in a favourable state
to play the part of listener, with something of the same instinct that
directs the hooded crow to the sick sheep among the flock, which will
most patiently suffer itself to be made a prey of. Joyfully did the poet
avail himself of the advantages afforded by Mordaunt’s absence of mind,
and unwillingness to exert himself in measures of active defence. With
the unfailing dexterity peculiar to prosers, he contrived to dribble out
his tale to double its usual length, by the exercise of the privilege of
unlimited digressions; so that the story, like a horse on the <i>grand
pas</i>, seemed to be advancing with rapidity, while, in reality, it scarce
was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> progressive at the rate of a yard in the quarter of an hour. At
length, however, he had discussed, in all its various bearings and
relations, the history of his friendly landlord, the master fashioner in
Russel Street, including a short sketch of five of his relations, and
anecdotes of three of his principal rivals, together with some general
observations upon the dress and fashion of the period; and having
marched thus far through the environs and outworks of his story, he
arrived at the body of the place, for so the Wits’ Coffeehouse might be
termed. He paused on the threshold, however, to explain the nature of
his landlord’s right occasionally to intrude himself into this
well-known temple of the Muses.</p>
<p>“It consisted,” said Halcro, “in the two principal points, of bearing
and forbearing; for my friend Thimblethwaite was a person of wit
himself, and never quarrelled with any jest which the wags who
frequented that house were flinging about, like squibs and crackers on a
rejoicing night; and then, though some of the wits—ay, and I daresay
the greater number, might have had some dealings with him in the way of
trade, he never was the person to put any man of genius in unpleasant
remembrance of such trifles. And though, my dear young Master Mordaunt,
you may think this is but ordinary civility, because in this country it
happens seldom that there is either much borrowing or lending, and
because, praised be Heaven, there are neither bailiffs nor
sheriff-officers to take a poor fellow by the neck, and because there
are no prisons to put him into when they have done so, yet, let me tell
you, that such a lamblike forbearance as that of my poor, dear, deceased
landlord, Thimblethwaite, is truly uncommon within the London bills of
mortality. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> could tell you of such things that have happened even to
myself, as well as others, with these cursed London tradesmen, as would
make your hair stand on end.—But what the devil has put old Magnus into
such note? he shouts as if he were trying his voice against a north-west
gale of wind.”</p>
<p>Loud indeed was the roar of the old Udaller, as, worn out of patience by
the schemes of improvement which the factor was now undauntedly pressing
upon his consideration, he answered him, (to use an Ossianic phrase,)
like a wave upon a rock,</p>
<p>“Trees, Sir Factor—talk not to me of trees! I care not though there
never be one on the island, tall enough to hang a coxcomb upon. We will
have no trees but those that rise in our havens—the good trees that
have yards for boughs, and standing-rigging for leaves.”</p>
<p>“But touching the draining of the lake of Braebaster, whereof I spoke to
you, Master Magnus Troil,” said the persevering agriculturist, “whilk I
opine would be of so much consequence, there are two ways—down the
Linklater glen, or by the Scalmester burn. Now, having taken the level
of both”——</p>
<p>“There is a third way, Master Yellowley,” answered the landlord.</p>
<p>“I profess I can see none,” replied Triptolemus, with as much good faith
as a joker could desire in the subject of his wit, “in respect that the
hill called Braebaster on the south, and ane high bank on the north, of
whilk I cannot carry the name rightly in my head”——</p>
<p>“Do not tell us of hills and banks, Master Yellowley—there is a third
way of draining the loch, and it is the only way that shall be tried in
my day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> You say my Lord Chamberlain and I are the joint proprietors—so
be it—let each of us start an equal proportion of brandy, lime-juice,
and sugar, into the loch—a ship’s cargo or two will do the job—let us
assemble all the jolly Udallers of the country, and in twenty-four hours
you shall see dry ground where the loch of Braebaster now is.”</p>
<p>A loud laugh of applause, which for a time actually silenced
Triptolemus, attended a jest so very well suited to time and place—a
jolly toast was given—a merry song was sung—the ship unloaded her
sweets—the pinnace made its genial rounds—the duet betwixt Magnus and
Triptolemus, which had attracted the attention of the whole company from
its superior vehemence, now once more sunk, and merged into the general
hum of the convivial table, and the poet Halcro again resumed his
usurped possession of the ear of Mordaunt Mertoun.</p>
<p>“Whereabouts was I?” he said, with a tone which expressed to his weary
listener more plainly than words could, how much of his desultory tale
yet remained to be told. “O, I remember—we were just at the door of the
Wits’ Coffeehouse—it was set up by one”——</p>
<p>“Nay, but, my dear Master Halcro,” said his hearer, somewhat
impatiently, “I am desirous to hear of your meeting with Dryden.”</p>
<p>“What, with glorious John?—true—ay—where was I? At the Wits’
Coffeehouse—Well, in at the door we got—the waiters, and so forth,
staring at me; for as to Thimblethwaite, honest fellow, his was a
well-known face.—I can tell you a story about that”——</p>
<p>“Nay, but John Dryden?” said Mordaunt, in a tone which deprecated
further digression.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>“Ay, ay, glorious John—where was I?—Well, as we stood close by the
bar, where one fellow sat grinding of coffee, and another putting up
tobacco into penny parcels—a pipe and a dish cost just a penny—then
and there it was that I had the first peep of him. One Dennis sat near
him, who”——</p>
<p>“Nay, but John Dryden—what like was he?” demanded Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Like a little fat old man, with his own grey hair, and in a
full-trimmed black suit, that sat close as a glove. Honest
Thimblethwaite let no one but himself shape for glorious John, and he
had a slashing hand at a sleeve, I promise you—But there is no getting
a mouthful of common sense spoken here—d—n that Scotchman, he and old
Magnus are at it again!”</p>
<p>It was very true; and although the interruption did not resemble a
thunder-clap, to which the former stentorian exclamation of the Udaller
might have been likened, it was a close and clamorous dispute,
maintained by question, answer, retort, and repartee, as closely huddled
upon each other as the sounds which announce from a distance a close and
sustained fire of musketry.</p>
<p>“Hear reason, sir?” said the Udaller; “we will hear reason, and speak
reason too; and if reason fall short, you shall have rhyme to boot.—Ha,
my little friend Halcro!”</p>
<p>Though cut off in the middle of his best story, (if that could be said
to have a middle, which had neither beginning nor end,) the bard
bristled up at the summons, like a corps of light infantry when ordered
up to the support of the grenadiers, looked smart, slapped the table
with his hand, and denoted his becoming readiness to back his hospitable
land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>lord, as becomes a well-entertained guest. Triptolemus was a little
daunted at this reinforcement of his adversary; he paused, like a
cautious general, in the sweeping attack which he had commenced on the
peculiar usages of Zetland, and spoke not again until the Udaller poked
him with the insulting query, “Where is your reason now, Master
Yellowley, that you were deafening me with a moment since?”</p>
<p>“Be but patient, worthy sir,” replied the agriculturist; “what on earth
can you or any other man say in defence of that thing you call a plough,
in this blinded country? Why, even the savage Highlandmen, in Caithness
and Sutherland, can make more work, and better, with their gascromh, or
whatever they call it.”</p>
<p>“But what ails you at it, sir?” said the Udaller; “let me hear your
objections to it. It tills our land, and what would ye more?”</p>
<p>“It hath but one handle or stilt,” replied Triptolemus.</p>
<p>“And who the devil,” said the poet, aiming at something smart, “would
wish to need a pair of stilts, if he can manage to walk with a single
one?”</p>
<p>“Or tell me,” said Magnus Troil, “how it were possible for Neil of
Lupness, that lost one arm by his fall from the crag of Nekbreckan, to
manage a plough with two handles?”</p>
<p>“The harness is of raw seal-skin,” said Triptolemus.</p>
<p>“It will save dressed leather,” answered Magnus Troil.</p>
<p>“It is drawn by four wretched bullocks,” said the agriculturist, “that
are yoked breast-fashion; and two women must follow this unhappy
instru<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>ment, and complete the furrows with a couple of shovels.”</p>
<p>“Drink about, Master Yellowley,” said the Udaller; “and, as you say in
Scotland, ‘never fash your thumb.’ Our cattle are too high-spirited to
let one go before the other; our men are too gentle and well-nurtured to
take the working-field without the women’s company; our ploughs till our
land—our land bears us barley; we brew our ale, eat our bread, and make
strangers welcome to their share of it. Here’s to you, Master
Yellowley.”</p>
<p>This was said in a tone meant to be decisive of the question; and,
accordingly, Halcro whispered to Mordaunt, “That has settled the matter,
and now we will get on with glorious John.—There he sat in his suit of
full-trimmed black; two years due was the bill, as mine honest landlord
afterwards told me,—and such an eye in his head!—none of your burning,
blighting, falcon eyes, which we poets are apt to make a rout
about,—but a soft, full, thoughtful, yet penetrating glance—never saw
the like of it in my life, unless it were little Stephen Kleancogg’s,
the fiddler, at Papastow, who”——</p>
<p>“Nay, but John Dryden?” said Mordaunt, who, for want of better
amusement, had begun to take a sort of pleasure in keeping the old
gentleman to his narrative, as men herd in a restiff sheep, when they
wish to catch him. He returned to his theme, with his usual phrase of
“Ay, true—glorious John—Well, sir, he cast his eye, such as I have
described it, on mine landlord, and ‘Honest Tim,’ said he, ‘what hast
thou got here?’ and all the wits, and lords, and gentlemen, that used to
crowd round him, like the wenches round a pedlar at a fair, they made
way for us, and up we came to the fireside, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> he had his own
established chair,—I have heard it was carried to the balcony in
summer, but it was by the fireside when I saw it,—so up came Tim
Thimblethwaite, through the midst of them, as bold as a lion, and I
followed with a small parcel under my arm, which I had taken up partly
to oblige my landlord, as the shop porter was not in the way, and partly
that I might be thought to have something to do there, for you are to
think there was no admittance at the Wits’ for strangers who had no
business there.—I have heard that Sir Charles Sedley said a good thing
about that”——</p>
<p>“Nay, but you forget glorious John,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“Ay, glorious you may well call him. They talk of their Blackmore, and
Shadwell, and such like,—not fit to tie the latchets of John’s
shoes—‘Well,’ he said to my landlord, ‘what have you got there?’ and
he, bowing, I warrant, lower than he would to a duke, said he had made
bold to come and show him the stuff which Lady Elizabeth had chose for
her nightgown.—‘And which of your geese is that, Tim, who has got it
tucked under his wing?’—‘He is an Orkney goose, if it please you, Mr.
Dryden,’ said Tim, who had wit at will, ‘and he hath brought you a copy
of verses for your honour to look at.’—‘Is he amphibious?’ said
glorious John, taking the paper,—and methought I could rather have
faced a battery of cannon than the crackle it gave as it opened, though
he did not speak in a way to dash one neither;—and then he looked at
the verses, and he was pleased to say, in a very encouraging way indeed,
with a sort of good-humoured smile on his face, and certainly for a fat
elderly gentleman,—for I would not compare it to Minna’s smile, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Brenda’s,—he had the pleasantest smile I ever saw,—‘Why, Tim,’ he
said, ‘this goose of yours will prove a swan on your hands.’ With that
he smiled a little, and they all laughed, and none louder than those who
stood too far off to hear the jest; for every one knew when he smiled
there was something worth laughing at, and so took it upon trust; and
the word passed through among the young Templars, and the wits, and the
smarts, and there was nothing but question on question who we were; and
one French fellow was trying to tell them it was only Monsieur Tim
Thimblethwaite; but he made such work with his Dumbletate and
Timbletate, that I thought his explanation would have lasted”——</p>
<p>“As long as your own story,” thought Mordaunt; but the narrative was at
length finally cut short, by the strong and decided voice of the
Udaller.</p>
<p>“I will hear no more on it, Mr. Factor!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“At least let me say something about the breed of horses,” said
Yellowley, in rather a cry-mercy tone of voice. “Your horses, my dear
sir, resemble cats in size, and tigers in devilry!”</p>
<p>“For their size,” said Magnus, “they are the easier for us to get off
and on them—[as Triptolemus experienced this morning, thought Mordaunt
to himself]—and, as for their devilry, let no one mount them that
cannot manage them.”</p>
<p>A twinge of self-conviction, on the part of the agriculturist, prevented
him from reply. He darted a deprecatory glance at Mordaunt, as if for
the purpose of imploring secrecy respecting his tumble; and the Udaller,
who saw his advantage, although he was not aware of the cause, pursued
it with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> high and stern tone proper to one who had all his life been
unaccustomed to meet with, and unapt to endure, opposition.</p>
<p>“By the blood of Saint Magnus the Martyr,” he said, “but you are a fine
fellow, Master Factor Yellowley! You come to us from a strange land,
understanding neither our laws, nor our manners, nor our language, and
you propose to become governor of the country, and that we should all be
your slaves!”</p>
<p>“My pupils, worthy sir, my pupils!” said Yellowley, “and that only for
your own proper advantage.”</p>
<p>“We are too old to go to school,” said the Zetlander. “I tell you once
more, we will sow and reap our grain as our fathers did—we will eat
what God sends us, with our doors open to the stranger, even as theirs
were open. If there is aught imperfect in our practice, we will amend it
in time and season; but the blessed Baptist’s holyday was made for light
hearts and quick heels. He that speaks a word more of reason, as you
call it, or any thing that looks like it, shall swallow a pint of
sea-water—he shall, by this hand!—and so fill up the good ship, the
Jolly Mariner of Canton, once more, for the benefit of those that will
stick by her; and let the rest have a fling with the fiddlers, who have
been summoning us this hour. I will warrant every wench is on tiptoe by
this time. Come, Mr. Yellowley, no unkindness, man—why, man, thou
feelest the rolling of the Jolly Mariner still”—(for, in truth, honest
Triptolemus showed a little unsteadiness of motion, as he rose to attend
his host)—“but never mind, we shall have thee find thy land-legs to
reel it with yonder bonny belles. Come along, Triptole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>mus—let me
grapple thee fast, lest thou <i>trip</i>, old Triptolemus—ha, ha, ha!”</p>
<p>So saying, the portly though weatherbeaten hulk of the Udaller sailed
off like a man-of-war that had braved a hundred gales, having his guest
in tow like a recent prize. The greater part of the revellers followed
their leader with loud jubilee, although there were several stanch
topers, who, taking the option left them by the Udaller, remained behind
to relieve the Jolly Mariner of a fresh cargo, amidst many a pledge to
the health of their absent landlord, and to the prosperity of his
roof-tree, with whatsoever other wishes of kindness could be devised, as
an apology for another pint-bumper of noble punch.</p>
<p>The rest soon thronged the dancing-room, an apartment which partook of
the simplicity of the time and of the country. Drawing-rooms and saloons
were then unknown in Scotland, save in the houses of the nobility, and
of course absolutely so in Zetland; but a long, low, anomalous
store-room, sometimes used for the depositation of merchandise,
sometimes for putting aside lumber, and a thousand other purposes, was
well known to all the youth of Dunrossness, and of many a district
besides, as the scene of the merry dance, which was sustained with so
much glee when Magnus Troil gave his frequent feasts.</p>
<p>The first appearance of this ball-room might have shocked a fashionable
party, assembled for the quadrille or the waltz. Low as we have stated
the apartment to be, it was but imperfectly illuminated by lamps,
candles, ship-lanterns, and a variety of other <i>candelabra</i>, which
served to throw a dusky light upon the floor, and upon the heaps of
merchan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>dise and miscellaneous articles which were piled around; some of
them stores for the winter; some, goods destined for exportation; some,
the tribute of Neptune, paid at the expense of shipwrecked vessels,
whose owners were unknown; some, articles of barter received by the
proprietor, who, like most others at the period, was somewhat of a
merchant as well as a landholder, in exchange for the fish, and other
articles, the produce of his estate. All these, with the chests, boxes,
casks, &amp;c., which contained them, had been drawn aside, and piled one
above the other, in order to give room for the dancers, who, light and
lively as if they had occupied the most splendid saloon in the parish of
St. James’s, executed their national dances with equal grace and
activity.</p>
<p>The group of old men who looked on, bore no inconsiderable resemblance
to a party of aged tritons, engaged in beholding the sports of the
sea-nymphs; so hard a look had most of them acquired by contending with
the elements, and so much did the shaggy hair and beards, which many of
them cultivated after the ancient Norwegian fashion, give their heads
the character of these supposed natives of the deep. The young people,
on the other hand, were uncommonly handsome, tall, well-made, and
shapely; the men with long fair hair, and, until broken by the weather,
a fresh ruddy complexion, which, in the females, was softened into a
bloom of infinite delicacy. Their natural good ear for music qualified
them to second to the utmost the exertions of a band, whose strains were
by no means contemptible; while the elders, who stood around or sat
quiet upon the old sea-chests, which served for chairs, criticised the
dancers, as they compared their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> execution with their own exertions in
former days; or, warmed by the cup and flagon, which continued to
circulate among them, snapped their fingers, and beat time with their
feet to the music.</p>
<p>Mordaunt looked upon this scene of universal mirth with the painful
recollection, that he, thrust aside from his pre-eminence, no longer
exercised the important duties of chief of the dancers, or office of
leader of the revels, which had been assigned to the stranger Cleveland.
Anxious, however, to suppress the feelings of his own disappointment,
which he felt it was neither wise to entertain nor manly to display, he
approached his fair neighbours, to whom he had been so acceptable at
table, with the purpose of inviting one of them to become his partner in
the dance. But the awfully ancient old lady, even the Lady Glowrowrum,
who had only tolerated the exuberance of her nieces’ mirth during the
time of dinner, because her situation rendered it then impossible for
her to interfere, was not disposed to permit the apprehended renewal of
the intimacy implied in Mertoun’s invitation. She therefore took upon
herself, in the name of her two nieces, who sat pouting beside her in
displeased silence, to inform Mordaunt, after thanking him for his
civility, that the hands of her nieces were engaged for that evening;
and, as he continued to watch the party at a little distance, he had an
opportunity of being convinced that the alleged engagement was a mere
apology to get rid of him, when he saw the two good-humoured sisters
join the dance, under the auspices of the next young men who asked their
hands. Incensed at so marked a slight, and unwilling to expose himself
to another, Mordaunt Mertoun drew back from the circle of dancers,
shrouded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> himself amongst the mass of inferior persons who crowded into
the bottom of the room as spectators, and there, concealed from the
observation of others, digested his own mortification as well as he
could—that is to say, very ill—and with all the philosophy of his
age—that is to say, with none at all.</p>

<p>The youth, says the moralist Johnson, cares not for the boy’s

seem trifling to many of my readers, who would, nevertheless, think they
did well to be angry if deposed from their usual place in an assembly of
a different kind. There lacked not amusement, however, for those whom
the dance did not suit, or who were not happy enough to find partners to
their liking. Halcro, now completely in his element, had assembled round
him an audience, to whom he was declaiming his poetry with all the
enthusiasm of glorious John himself, and receiving in return the usual
degree of applause allowed to minstrels who recite their own rhymes—so
long at least as the author is within hearing of the criticism. Halcro’s
poetry might indeed have interested the antiquary as well as the admirer
of the Muses, for several of his pieces were translations or imitations
from the Scaldic sagas, which continued to be sung by the fishermen of
those islands even until a very late period; insomuch, that when Gray’s
poems first found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> their way to Orkney, the old people recognised at
once, in the ode of the “Fatal Sisters,” the Runic rhymes which had
amused or terrified their infancy under the title of the “Magicians,”
and which the fishers of North Ronaldshaw, and other remote isles, used
still to sing when asked for a Norse ditty.<a id="FNanchor_41_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41_49">[41]</a></p>
<p>Half listening, half lost in his own reflections, Mordaunt Mertoun stood
near the door of the apartment, and in the outer ring of the little
circle formed around old Halcro, while the bard chanted to a low, wild,
monotonous air, varied only by the efforts of the singer to give
interest and emphasis to particular passages, the following imitation of
a Northern war-song:</p>
<h3>THE SONG OF HAROLD HARFAGER.</h3>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun is rising dimly red,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind is wailing low and dread;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From his cliff the eagle sallies,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaves the wolf his darksome valleys;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the midst the ravens hover,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peep the wild-dogs from the cover,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Screaming, croaking, baying, yelling,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each in his wild accents telling,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Soon we feast on dead and dying,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair-hair’d Harold’s flag is flying.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many a crest in air is streaming,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many a helmet darkly gleaming,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many an arm the axe uprears,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doom’d to hew the wood of spears.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All along the crowded ranks,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Horses neigh and armour clanks;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chiefs are shouting, clarions ringing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Louder still the bard is singing,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Gather, footmen,—gather, horsemen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the field, ye valiant Norsemen!</span><br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Halt ye not for food or slumber,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">View not vantage, count not number;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jolly reapers, forward still;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grow the crop on vale or hill,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thick or scatter’d, stiff or lithe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shall down before the scythe.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forward with your sickles bright,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reap the harvest of the fight—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Onward, footmen,—onward, horsemen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the charge, ye gallant Norsemen!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Fatal Choosers of the Slaughter,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O’er you hovers Odin’s daughter;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hear the voice she spreads before ye,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Victory, and wealth, and glory;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or old Valhalla’s roaring hail,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her ever-circling mead and ale,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where for eternity unite</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The joys of wassail and of fight.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Headlong forward, foot and horsemen,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charge and fight, and die like Norsemen!”</span><br>
</p>
<p>“The poor unhappy blinded heathens!” said Triptolemus, with a sigh deep
enough for a groan; “they speak of their eternal cups of ale, and I
question if they kend how to manage a croft land of grain!”</p>
<p>“The cleverer fellows they, neighbour Yellowley,” answered the poet, “if
they made ale without barley.”</p>
<p>“Barley!—alack-a-day!” replied the more accurate agriculturist, “who
ever heard of barley in these parts? Bear, my dearest friend, bear is
all they have, and wonderment it is to me that they ever see an awn of
it. Ye scart the land with a bit thing ye ca’ a pleugh—ye might as weel
give it a ritt with the teeth of a redding-kame. O, to see the sock, and
the heel, and the sole-clout of a real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> steady Scottish pleugh, with a
chield like a Samson between the stilts, laying a weight on them would
keep down a mountain; twa stately owsen, and as many broad-breasted
horse in the traces, going through soil and till, and leaving a fur in
the ground would carry off water like a causeyed syver! They that have
seen a sight like that, have seen something to crack about in another
sort, than those unhappy auld-warld stories of war and slaughter, of
which the land has seen even but too mickle, for a’ your singing and
soughing awa in praise of such bloodthirsty doings, Master Claud
Halcro.”</p>
<p>“It is a heresy,” said the animated little poet, bridling and drawing
himself up, as if the whole defence of the Orcadian Archipelago rested
on his single arm—“It is a heresy so much as to name one’s native
country, if a man is not prepared when and how to defend himself—ay,
and to annoy another. The time has been, that if we made not good ale
and aquavitæ, we knew well enough where to find that which was ready
made to our hand; but now the descendants of Sea-kings, and Champions,
and Berserkars, are become as incapable of using their swords, as if
they were so many women. Ye may praise them for a strong pull on an oar,
or a sure foot on a skerry; but what else could glorious John himself
say of ye, my good Hialtlanders, that any man would listen to?”</p>
<p>“Spoken like an angel, most noble poet,” said Cleveland, who, during an
interval of the dance, stood near the party in which this conversation
was held. “The old champions you talked to us about yesternight, were
the men to make a harp ring—gallant fellows, that were friends to the
sea, and enemies to all that sailed on it. Their ships, I sup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>pose, were
clumsy enough; but if it is true that they went upon the account as far
as the Levant, I scarce believe that ever better fellows unloosed a
topsail.”</p>
<p>“Ay,” replied Halcro, “there you spoke them right. In those days none
could call their life and means of living their own, unless they dwelt
twenty miles out of sight of the blue sea. Why, they had public prayers
put up in every church in Europe, for deliverance from the ire of the
Northmen. In France and England, ay, and in Scotland too, for as high as
they hold their head now-a-days, there was not a bay or a haven, but it
was freer to our forefathers than to the poor devils of natives; and now
we cannot, forsooth, so much as grow our own barley without Scottish
help”—(here he darted a sarcastic glance at the factor)—“I would I saw
the time we were to measure arms with them again!”</p>
<p>“Spoken like a hero once more,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Ah!” continued the little bard, “I would it were possible to see our
barks, once the water-dragons of the world, swimming with the black
raven standard waving at the topmast, and their decks glimmering with
arms, instead of being heaped up with stockfish—winning with our
fearless hands what the niggard soil denies—paying back all old scorn
and modern injury—reaping where we never sowed, and felling what we
never planted—living and laughing through the world, and smiling when
we were summoned to quit it!”</p>
<p>So spoke Claud Halcro, in no serious, or at least most certainly in no
sober mood, his brain (never the most stable) whizzing under the
influence of fifty well-remembered sagas, besides five bumpers of
usquebaugh and brandy; and Cleveland, between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> jest and earnest, clapped
him on the shoulder, and again repeated, “Spoken like a hero!”</p>
<p>“Spoken like a fool, I think,” said Magnus Troil, whose attention had
been also attracted by the vehemence of the little bard—“where would
you cruize upon, or against whom?—we are all subjects of one realm, I
trow, and I would have you to remember, that your voyage may bring up at
Execution-dock.—I like not the Scots—no offence, Mr. Yellowley—that
is, I would like them well enough if they would stay quiet in their own
land, and leave us at peace with our own people, and manners, and
fashions; and if they would but abide there till I went to harry them
like a mad old Berserkar, I would leave them in peace till the day of
judgment. With what the sea sends us, and the land lends us, as the
proverb says, and a set of honest neighbourly folks to help us to
consume it, so help me, Saint Magnus, as I think we are even but too
happy!”</p>
<p>“I know what war is,” said an old man, “and I would as soon sail through
Sumburgh-roost in a cockle-shell, or in a worse loom, as I would venture
there again.”</p>
<p>“And, pray, what wars knew your valour?” said Halcro, who, though
forbearing to contradict his landlord from a sense of respect, was not a
whit inclined to abandon his argument to any meaner authority.</p>
<p>“I was pressed,” answered the old Triton, “to serve under Montrose, when
he came here about the sixteen hundred and fifty-one, and carried a sort
of us off, will ye nill ye, to get our throats cut in the wilds of
Strathnavern<a id="FNanchor_42_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_50">[42]</a><a id="FNanchor_K_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_K_51">(<i>k</i>)</a>—I shall never forget it—we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> had been hard put to
it for victuals—what would I have given for a luncheon of Burgh-Westra
beef—ay, or a mess of sour sillocks?—When our Highlandmen brought in a
dainty drove of kyloes, much ceremony there was not, for we shot and
felled, and flayed, and roasted, and broiled, as it came to every man’s
hand; till, just as our beards were at the greasiest, we heard—God
preserve us—a tramp of horse, then twa or three drapping shots,—then
came a full salvo,—and then, when the officers were crying on us to
stand, and maist of us looking which way we might run away, down they
broke, horse and foot, with old John Urry, or Hurry,<a id="FNanchor_43_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_52">[43]</a> or whatever
they called him—he hurried us that day, and worried us to boot—and we
began to fall as thick as the stots that we were felling five minutes
before.”</p>
<p>“And Montrose,” said the soft voice of the graceful Minna; “what became
of Montrose, or how looked he?”</p>
<p>“Like a lion with the hunters before him,” answered the old gentleman;
“but I looked not twice his way, for my own lay right over the hill.”</p>
<p>“And so you left him?” said Minna, in a tone of the deepest contempt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>“It was no fault of mine, Mistress Minna,” answered the old man,
somewhat out of countenance; “but I was there with no choice of my own;
and, besides, what good could I have done?—all the rest were running
like sheep, and why should I have staid?”</p>
<p>“You might have died with him,” said Minna.</p>
<p>“And lived with him to all eternity, in immortal verse!” added Claud
Halcro.</p>
<p>“I thank you, Mistress Minna,” replied the plain-dealing Zetlander; “and
I thank you, my old friend Claud;—but I would rather drink both your
healths in this good bicker of ale, like a living man as I am, than that
you should be making songs in my honour, for having died forty or fifty
years agone. But what signified it,—run or fight, ’twas all one;—they
took Montrose, poor fellow, for all his doughty deeds, and they took me
that did no doughty deeds at all; and they hanged him, poor man, and as
for me”——</p>
<p>“I trust in Heaven they flogged and pickled you,” said Cleveland, worn
out of patience with the dull narrative of the peaceful Zetlander’s
poltroonery, of which he seemed so wondrous little ashamed.</p>
<p>“Flog horses, and pickle beef,” said Magnus; “Why, you have not the
vanity to think, that, with all your quarterdeck airs, you will make
poor old neighbour Haagen ashamed that he was not killed some scores of
years since? You have looked on death yourself, my doughty young friend,
but it was with the eyes of a young man who wishes to be thought of; but
we are a peaceful people,—peaceful, that is, as long as any one should
be peaceful, and that is till some one has the impudence to wrong us, or
our neighbours; and then, perhaps, they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> not find our northern blood
much cooler in our veins than was that of the old Scandinavians that
gave us our names and lineage.—Get ye along, get ye along to the
sword-dance,<a id="FNanchor_44_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_53">[44]</a> that the strangers that are amongst us may see that our
hands and our weapons are not altogether unacquainted even yet.”</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<img alt="" src="images/i_267.jpg" title="" id="img_images_i_267.jpg" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>
<p>A dozen cutlasses, selected hastily from an old arm-chest, and whose
rusted hue bespoke how seldom they left the sheath, armed the same
number of young Zetlanders, with whom mingled six maidens, led by Minna
Troil; and the minstrelsy instantly commenced a tune appropriate to the
ancient Norwegian war-dance, the evolutions of which are perhaps still
practised in those remote islands.</p>
<p>The first movement was graceful and majestic, the youths holding their
swords erect, and without much gesture; but the tune, and the
corresponding motions of the dancers, became gradually more and more
rapid,—they clashed their swords together, in measured time, with a
spirit which gave the exercise a dangerous appearance in the eye of the
spectator, though the firmness, justice, and accuracy, with which the
dancers kept time with the stroke of their weapons, did, in truth,
ensure its safety. The most singular part of the exhibition was the
courage exhibited by the female performers, who now, surrounded by the
swordsmen, seemed like the Sabine maidens in the hands of their Roman
lovers; now, moving under the arch of steel which the young men had
formed, by crossing their weapons over the heads of their fair partners,
resembled the band of Amazons when they first joined in the Pyrrhic
dance with the followers of Theseus. But by far the most striking and
appropriate figure <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>was that of Minna Troil, whom Halcro had long
since entitled the Queen of Swords, and who, indeed, moved amidst the
swordsmen with an air, which seemed to hold all the drawn blades as the
proper accompaniments of her person, and the implements of her pleasure.
And when the mazes of the dance became more intricate, when the close
and continuous clash of the weapons made some of her companions shrink,
and show signs of fear, her cheek, her lip, and her eye, seemed rather
to announce, that, at the moment when the weapons flashed fastest, and
rung sharpest around her, she was most completely self-possessed, and in
her own element. Last of all, when the music had ceased, and she
remained for an instant upon the floor by herself, as the rule of the
dance required, the swordsmen and maidens, who departed from around her,
seemed the guards and the train of some princess, who, dismissed by her
signal, were leaving her for a time to solitude. Her own look and
attitude, wrapped, as she probably was, in some vision of the
imagination, corresponded admirably with the ideal dignity which the
spectators ascribed to her; but, almost immediately recollecting
herself, she blushed, as if conscious she had been, though but for an
instant, the object of undivided attention, and gave her hand gracefully
to Cleveland, who, though he had not joined in the dance, assumed the
duty of conducting her to her seat.</p>
<p>As they passed, Mordaunt Mertoun might observe that Cleveland whispered
into Minna’s ear, and that her brief reply was accompanied with even
more discomposure of countenance than she had manifested when
encountering the gaze of the whole assembly. Mordaunt’s suspicions were
strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> awakened by what he observed, for he knew Minna’s character
well, and with what equanimity and indifference she was in the custom of
receiving the usual compliments and gallantries with which her beauty
and her situation rendered her sufficiently familiar.</p>
<p>“Can it be possible she really loves this stranger?” was the unpleasant
thought that instantly shot across Mordaunt’s mind;—“And if she does,
what is my interest in the matter?” was the second; and which was
quickly followed by the reflection, that though he claimed no interest
at any time but as a friend, and though that interest was now withdrawn,
he was still, in consideration of their former intimacy, entitled both
to be sorry and angry at her for throwing away her affections on one he
judged unworthy of her. In this process of reasoning, it is probable
that a little mortified vanity, or some indescribable shade of selfish
regret, might be endeavouring to assume the disguise of disinterested
generosity; but there is so much of base alloy in our very best
(unassisted) thoughts, that it is melancholy work to criticise too
closely the motives of our most worthy actions; at least we would
recommend to every one to let those of his neighbours pass current,
however narrowly he may examine the purity of his own.</p>
<p>The sword-dance was succeeded by various other specimens of the same
exercise, and by songs, to which the singers lent their whole soul,
while the audience were sure, as occasion offered, to unite in some
favourite chorus. It is upon such occasions that music, though of a
simple and even rude character, finds its natural empire over the
generous bosom, and produces that strong excitement which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> cannot be
attained by the most learned compositions of the first masters, which
are caviare to the common ear, although, doubtless, they afford a
delight, exquisite in its kind, to those whose natural capacity and
education have enabled them to comprehend and relish those difficult and
complicated combinations of harmony.</p>
<p>It was about midnight when a knocking at the door of the mansion, with
the sound of the <i>Gue</i> and the <i>Langspiel</i>, announced, by their tinkling
chime, the arrival of fresh revellers, to whom, according to the
hospitable custom of the country, the apartments were instantly thrown
open.</p>

augmented his small army of Danes and Scottish Royalists,

</p>
<p>The new-comers were, according to the frequent custom of such frolickers
all over the world, disguised in a sort of masquing habits, and designed
to represent the Tritons and Mermaids, with whom ancient tradition and
popular belief have peopled the northern seas. The former, called by
Zetlanders of that time, Shoupeltins, were represented by young men
grotesquely habited, with false hair, and beards made of flax, and
chaplets composed of sea-ware interwoven with shells, and other marine
productions, with which also were decorated their light-blue or greenish
mantles of wadmaal, repeatedly before-mentioned. They had fish-spears,
and other emblems of their assumed quality, amongst which the classical
taste of Claud Halcro, by whom the masque was arranged, had not
forgotten the conch-shells, which were stoutly and hoarsely winded, from
time to time, by one or two of the aquatic deities, to the great
annoyance of all who stood near them.</p>
<p>The Nereids and Water-nymphs who attended on this occasion, displayed,
as usual, a little more taste and ornament than was to be seen amongst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
their male attendants. Fantastic garments of green silk, and other
materials of superior cost and fashion, had been contrived, so as to
imitate their idea of the inhabitants of the waters, and, at the same
time, to show the shape and features of the fair wearers to the best
advantage. The bracelets and shells, which adorned the neck, arms, and
ankles of the pretty Mermaidens, were, in some cases, intermixed with
real pearls; and the appearance, upon the whole, was such as might have
done no discredit to the court of Amphitrite, especially when the long
bright locks, blue eyes, fair complexions, and pleasing features of the
maidens of Thule, were taken into consideration. We do not indeed
pretend to aver, that any of these seeming Mermaids had so accurately
imitated the real siren, as commentators have supposed those attendant
on Cleopatra did, who, adopting the fish’s train of their original, were
able, nevertheless, to make their “bends,” or “ends,” (said commentators
cannot tell which,) “adornings.”<a id="FNanchor_45_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_55">[45]</a> Indeed, had they not left their
extremities in their natural state, it would have been impossible for
the Zetland sirens to have executed the very pretty dance, with which
they rewarded the company for the ready admission which had been granted
to them.</p>
<p>It was soon discovered that these masquers were no strangers, but a part
of the guests, who, stealing out a little time before, had thus
disguised themselves, in order to give variety to the mirth of the
evening. The muse of Claud Halcro, always active on such occasions, had
supplied them with an appropriate song, of which we may give the
follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ing specimen. The song was alternate betwixt a Nereid or Mermaid,
and a Merman or Triton—the males and females on either part forming a
semi-chorus, which accompanied and bore burden to the principal singer.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We heard you in our twilight caves,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For notes of joy can pierce the waves,</span><br>

<p>The final chorus was borne by the whole voices, excepting those carrying
the conch-shells, who had been trained to blow them in a sort of rude
accompaniment, which had a good effect. The poetry, as well as the
performance of the masquers, received great applause from all who
pretended to be judges of such matters; but above all, from Triptolemus
Yellowley, who, his ear having caught the agricultural sounds of plough
and furrow, and his brain being so well drenched that it could only
construe the words in their most literal acceptation, declared roundly,
and called Mordaunt to bear witness, that, though it was a shame to
waste so much good lint as went to form the Tritons’ beards and
periwigs, the song contained the only words of common sense which he had
heard all that long day.</p>
<p>But Mordaunt had no time to answer the appeal, being engaged in
attending with the utmost vigilance to the motions of one of the female
masquers, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>who had given him a private signal as they entered, which
induced him, though uncertain who she might prove to be, to expect some
communication from her of importance. The siren who had so boldly
touched his arm, and had accompanied the gesture with an expression of
eye which bespoke his attention, was disguised with a good deal more
care than her sister-masquers, her mantle being loose, and wide enough
to conceal her shape completely, and her face hidden beneath a silk
mask. He observed that she gradually detached herself from the rest of
the masquers, and at length placed herself, as if for the advantage of
the air, near the door of a chamber which remained open, looked
earnestly at him again, and then taking an opportunity, when the
attention of the company was fixed upon the rest of her party, she left
the apartment.</p>
<p>Mordaunt did not hesitate instantly to follow his mysterious guide, for
such we may term the masquer, as she paused to let him see the direction
she was about to take, and then walked swiftly towards the shore of the
voe, or salt-water lake, now lying full before them, its small
summer-waves glistening and rippling under the influence of a broad
moonlight, which, added to the strong twilight of those regions during
the summer solstice, left no reason to regret the absence of the sun,
the path of whose setting was still visible on the waves of the west,
while the horizon on the east side was already beginning to glimmer with
the lights of dawn.</p>
<p>Mordaunt had therefore no difficulty in keeping sight of his disguised
guide, as she tripped it over height and hollow to the sea-side, and,
winding among the rocks, led the way to the spot where his own labours,
during the time of his former intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> at Burgh-Westra, had constructed
a sheltered and solitary seat, where the daughters of Magnus were
accustomed to spend, when the weather was suitable, a good deal of their
time. Here, then, was to be the place of explanation; for the masquer
stopped, and, after a moment’s hesitation, sat down on the rustic
settle. But, from the lips of whom was he to receive it? Norna had first
occurred to him; but her tall figure and slow majestic step were
entirely different from the size and gait of the more fairy-formed
siren, who had preceded him with as light a trip as if she had been a
real Nereid, who, having remained too late upon the shore, was, under
the dread of Amphitrite’s displeasure, hastening to regain her native
element. Since it was not Norna, it could be only, he thought, Brenda,
who thus singled him out; and when she had seated herself upon the
bench, and taken the mask from her face, Brenda it accordingly proved to
be. Mordaunt had certainly done nothing to make him dread her presence;
and yet, such is the influence of bashfulness over the ingenuous youth
of both sexes, that he experienced all the embarrassment of one who
finds himself unexpectedly placed before a person who is justly offended
with him. Brenda felt no less embarrassment; but as she had sought this
interview, and was sensible it must be a brief one, she was compelled,
in spite of herself, to begin the conversation.</p>
<p>“Mordaunt,” she said, with a hesitating voice; then correcting herself,
she proceeded—“You must be surprised, Mr. Mertoun, that I should have
taken this uncommon freedom.”</p>
<p>“It was not till this morning, Brenda,” replied Mordaunt, “that any mark
of friendship or inti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>macy from you or from your sister could have
surprised me. I am far more astonished that you should shun me without
reason for so many hours, than that you should now allow me an
interview. In the name of Heaven, Brenda, in what have I offended you?
or why are we on these unusual terms?”</p>
<p>“May it not be enough to say,” replied Brenda, looking downward, “that
it is my father’s pleasure?”</p>
<p>“No, it is not enough,” returned Mertoun. “Your father cannot have so
suddenly altered his whole thoughts of me, and his whole actions towards
me, without acting under the influence of some strong delusion. I ask
you but to explain of what nature it is; for I will be contented to be
lower in your esteem than the meanest hind in these islands, if I cannot
show that his change of opinion is only grounded upon some infamous
deception, or some extraordinary mistake.”</p>
<p>“It may be so,” said Brenda—“I hope it is so—that I do hope it is so,
my desire to see you thus in private may well prove to you. But it is
difficult—in short, it is impossible for me to explain to you the cause
of my father’s resentment. Norna has spoken with him concerning it
boldly, and I fear they parted in displeasure; and you well know no
light matter could cause that.”</p>
<p>“I have observed,” said Mordaunt, “that your father is most attentive to
Norna’s counsel, and more complaisant to her peculiarities than to those
of others—this I have observed, though he is no willing believer in the
supernatural qualities to which she lays claim.”</p>
<p>“They are related distantly,” answered Brenda, “and were friends in
youth—nay, as I have heard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> it was once supposed they would have been
married; but Norna’s peculiarities showed themselves immediately on her
father’s death, and there was an end of that matter, if ever there was
any thing in it. But it is certain my father regards her with much
interest; and it is, I fear, a sign how deeply his prejudices respecting
you must be rooted, since they have in some degree quarrelled on your
account.”</p>
<p>“Now, blessings upon you, Brenda, that you have called them prejudices,”
said Mertoun, warmly and hastily—“a thousand blessings on you! You were
ever gentle-hearted—you could not have maintained even the show of
unkindness long.”</p>
<p>“It was indeed but a show,” said Brenda, softening gradually into the
familiar tone in which they had conversed from infancy; “I could never
think, Mordaunt,—never, that is, seriously believe, that you could say
aught unkind of Minna or of me.”</p>
<p>“And who dares to say I have?” said Mordaunt, giving way to the natural
impetuosity of his disposition—“Who dares to say that I have, and
ventures at the same time to hope that I will suffer his tongue to
remain in safety betwixt his jaws? By Saint Magnus the Martyr, I will
feed the hawks with it!”</p>
<p>“Nay, now,” said Brenda, “your anger only terrifies me, and will force
me to leave you.”</p>
<p>“Leave me,” said he, “without telling me either the calumny, or the name
of the villainous calumniator!”</p>
<p>“O, there are more than one,” answered Brenda, “that have possessed my
father with an opinion—which I cannot myself tell you—but there are
more than one who say”—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>—</p>
<p>“Were they hundreds, Brenda, I will do no less to them than I have
said—Sacred Martyr!—to accuse me of speaking unkindly of those whom I
most respected and valued under Heaven—I will back to the apartment
this instant, and your father shall do me right before all the world.”</p>
<p>“Do not go, for the love of Heaven!” said Brenda; “do not go, as you
would not render me the most unhappy wretch in existence!”</p>
<p>“Tell me then, at least, if I guess aright,” said Mordaunt, “when I name
this Cleveland for one of those who have slandered me?”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Brenda, vehemently, “you run from one error into another
more dangerous. You say you are my friend:—I am willing to be
yours:—be but still for a moment, and hear what I have to say;—our
interview has lasted but too long already, and every additional moment
brings additional danger with it.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, then,” said Mertoun, much softened by the poor girl’s extreme
apprehension and distress, “what it is that you require of me; and
believe me, it is impossible for you to ask aught that I will not do my
very uttermost to comply with.”</p>
<p>“Well, then—this Captain,” said Brenda, “this Cleveland”——</p>
<p>“I knew it, by Heaven!” said Mordaunt; “my mind assured me that that
fellow was, in one way or other, at the bottom of all this mischief and
misunderstanding!”</p>
<p>“If you cannot be silent, and patient, for an instant,” replied Brenda,
“I must instantly quit you: what I meant to say had no relation to you,
but to another,—in one word, to my sister Minna. I have nothing to say
concerning her dislike to you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> but an anxious tale to tell concerning
his attention to her.”</p>
<p>“It is obvious, striking, and marked,” said Mordaunt; “and, unless my
eyes deceive me, it is received as welcome, if, indeed, it is not
returned.”</p>
<p>“That is the very cause of my fear,” said Brenda. “I, too, was struck
with the external appearance, frank manners, and romantic conversation
of this man.”</p>
<p>“His appearance!” said Mordaunt; “he is stout and well-featured enough,
to be sure; but, as old Sinclair of Quendale said to the Spanish
admiral, ‘Farcie on his face! I have seen many a fairer hang on the
Borough-moor.’—From his manners, he might be captain of a privateer;
and by his conversation, the trumpeter to his own puppetshow; for he
speaks of little else than his own exploits.”</p>
<p>“You are mistaken,” answered Brenda; “he speaks but too well on all that
he has seen and learned; besides, he has really been in many distant
countries, and in many gallant actions, and he can tell them with as
much spirit as modesty. You would think you saw the flash and heard the
report of the guns. And he has other tones of talking too—about the
delightful trees and fruits of distant climates; and how the people wear
no dress, through the whole year, half so warm as our summer gowns, and,
indeed, put on little except cambric and muslin.”</p>
<p>“Upon my word, Brenda, he does seem to understand the business of
amusing young ladies,” replied Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“He does, indeed,” said Brenda, with great simplicity. “I assure you
that, at first, I liked him better than Minna did; and yet, though she
is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> much cleverer than I am, I know more of the world than she does;
for I have seen more of cities, having been once at Kirkwall; besides
that I was thrice at Lerwick, when the Dutch ships were there, and so I
should not be very easily deceived in people.”</p>
<p>“And pray, Brenda,” said Mertoun, “what was it that made you think less
favourably of this young fellow, who seems to be so captivating?”</p>
<p>“Why,” said Brenda, after a moment’s reflection, “at first he was much
livelier; and the stories he told were not quite so melancholy, or so
terrible; and he laughed and danced more.”</p>
<p>“And, perhaps, at that time, danced oftener with Brenda than with her
sister?” added Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“No—I am not sure of that,” said Brenda; “and yet, to speak plain, I
could have no suspicion of him at all while he was attending quite
equally to us both; for you know that then he could have been no more to
us than yourself, Mordaunt Mertoun, or young Swaraster, or any other
young man in the islands.”</p>
<p>“But, why then,” said Mordaunt, “should you not see him, with patience,
become acquainted with your sister?—He is wealthy, or seems to be so at
least. You say he is accomplished and pleasant;—what else would you
desire in a lover for Minna?”</p>
<p>“Mordaunt, you forget who we are,” said the maiden, assuming an air of
consequence, which sat as gracefully upon her simplicity, as did the
different tone in which she had spoken hitherto. “This is a little world
of ours, this Zetland, inferior, perhaps, in soil and climate to other
parts of the earth, at least so strangers say; but it is our own little
world, and we, the daughters of Magnus Troil, hold a first rank in it.
It would I think, little become us, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> are descended from Sea-kings
and Jarls, to throw ourselves away upon a stranger, who comes to our
coast, like the eider-duck in spring, from we know not whence, and may
leave it in autumn, to go we know not where.”</p>
<p>“And who may yet entice a Zetland golden-eye to accompany his
migration,” said Mertoun.</p>
<p>“I will hear nothing light on such a subject,” replied Brenda,
indignantly; “Minna, like myself, is the daughter of Magnus Troil, the
friend of strangers, but the Father of Hialtland. He gives them the
hospitality they need; but let not the proudest of them think that they
can, at their pleasure, ally with his house.”</p>
<p>She said this in a tone of considerable warmth, which she instantly
softened, as she added, “No, Mordaunt, do not suppose that Minna Troil
is capable of so far forgetting what she owes to her father and her
father’s blood, as to think of marrying this Cleveland; but she may lend
an ear to him so long as to destroy her future happiness. She has that
sort of mind, into which some feelings sink deeply;—you remember how
Ulla Storlson used to go, day by day, to the top of Vossdale-head, to
look for her lover’s ship that was never to return? When I think of her
slow step, her pale cheek, her eye, that grew dimmer and dimmer, like
the lamp that is half extinguished for lack of oil,—when I remember the
fluttered look, of something like hope, with which she ascended the
cliff at morning, and the deep dead despair which sat on her forehead
when she returned,—when I think on all this, can you wonder that I fear
for Minna, whose heart is formed to entertain, with such deep-rooted
fidelity, any affection that may be implanted in it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I do not wonder,” said Mordaunt, eagerly sympathizing with the poor
girl; for, besides the tremulous expression of her voice, the light
could almost show him the tear which trembled in her eye, as she drew
the picture to which her fancy had assimilated her sister,—“I do not
wonder that you should feel and fear whatever the purest affection can
dictate; and if you can but point out to me in what I can serve your
sisterly love, you shall find me as ready to venture my life, if
necessary, as I have been to go out on the crag to get you the eggs of
the guillemot; and, believe me, that whatever has been told to your
father or yourself, of my entertaining the slightest thoughts of
disrespect or unkindness, is as false as a fiend could devise.”</p>
<p>“I believe it,” said Brenda, giving him her hand; “I believe it, and my
bosom is lighter, now I have renewed my confidence in so old a friend.
How you can aid us, I know not; but it was by the advice, I may say by
the commands, of Norna, that I have ventured to make this communication;
and I almost wonder,” she added, as she looked around her, “that I have
had courage to carry me through it. At present you know all that I can
tell you of the risk in which my sister stands. Look after this
Cleveland—beware how you quarrel with him, since you must so surely
come by the worst with an experienced soldier.”</p>
<p>“I do not exactly understand,” said the youth, “how that should so
surely be. This I know, that with the good limbs and good heart that God
hath given me, ay, and with a good cause to boot—I am little afraid of
any quarrel which Cleveland can fix upon me.”</p>
<p>“Then, if not for your own sake, for Minna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>’s sake,” said Brenda—“for
my father’s—for mine—for all our sakes, avoid any strife with him, but
be contented to watch him, and, if possible, to discover who he is, and
what are his intentions towards us. He has talked of going to Orkney, to
enquire after the consort with whom he sailed; but day after day, and
week after week passes, and he goes not; and while he keeps my father
company over the bottle, and tells Minna romantic stories of foreign
people, and distant wars, in wild and unknown regions, the time glides
on, and the stranger, of whom we know nothing except that he is one,
becomes gradually closer and more inseparably intimate in our
society.—And now, farewell. Norna hopes to make your peace with my
father, and entreats you not to leave Burgh-Westra to-morrow, however
cold he and my sister may appear towards you. I too,” she said,
stretching her hand towards him, “must wear a face of cold friendship as
towards an unwelcome visitor, but at heart we are still Brenda and
Mordaunt. And now separate quickly, for we must not be seen together.”</p>
<p>She stretched her hand to him, but withdrew it in some slight confusion,
laughing and blushing, when, by a natural impulse, he was about to press
it to his lips. He endeavoured for a moment to detain her, for the
interview had for him a degree of fascination, which, as often as he had
before been alone with Brenda, he had never experienced. But she
extricated herself from him, and again signing an adieu, and pointing
out to him a path different from that which she was herself about to
take, tripped towards the house, and was soon hidden from his view by
the acclivity.</p>
<p>Mordaunt stood gazing after her in a state of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> to which, as yet,
he had been a stranger. The dubious neutral ground between love and
friendship may be long and safely trodden, until he who stands upon it
is suddenly called upon to recognise the authority of the one or the
other power; and then it most frequently happens, that the party who for
years supposed himself only a friend, finds himself at once transformed
into a lover. That such a change in Mordaunt’s feelings should take
place from this date, although he himself was unable exactly to
distinguish its nature, was to be expected. He found himself at once
received, with the most unsuspicious frankness, into the confidence of a
beautiful and fascinating young woman, by whom he had, so short a time
before, imagined himself despised and disliked; and, if any thing could
make a change, in itself so surprising and so pleasing, yet more
intoxicating, it was the guileless and open-hearted simplicity of
Brenda, that cast an enchantment over every thing which she did or said.
The scene, too, might have had its effect, though there was little
occasion for its aid. But a fair face looks yet fairer under the light
of the moon, and a sweet voice sounds yet sweeter among the whispering
sounds of a summer night. Mordaunt, therefore, who had by this time
returned to the house, was disposed to listen with unusual patience and
complacency to the enthusiastic declamation pronounced upon moonlight by
Claud Halcro, whose ecstasies had been awakened on the subject by a
short turn in the open air, undertaken to qualify the vapours of the
good liquor, which he had not spared during the festival.</p>
<p>“The sun, my boy,” he said, “is every wretched labourer’s
day-lantern—it comes glaring yonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> out of the east, to summon up a
whole world to labour and to misery; whereas the merry moon lights all
of us to mirth and to love.”</p>
<p>“And to madness, or she is much belied,” said Mordaunt, by way of saying
something.</p>
<p>“Let it be so,” answered Halcro, “so she does not turn us
melancholy-mad.—My dear young friend, the folks of this painstaking
world are far too anxious about possessing all their wits, or having
them, as they say, about them. At least I know I have been often called
half-witted, and I am sure I have gone through the world as well as if I
had double the quantity. But stop—where was I? O, touching and
concerning the moon—why, man, she is the very soul of love and poetry.
I question if there was ever a true lover in existence who had not got
at least as far as ‘O thou,’ in a sonnet in her praise.”</p>
<p>“The moon,” said the factor, who was now beginning to speak very thick,
“ripens corn, at least the old folk said so—and she fills nuts also,
whilk is of less matter—<i>sparge nuces, pueri</i>.”</p>
<p>“A fine, a fine,” said the Udaller, who was now in his altitudes; “the
factor speaks Greek—by the bones of my holy namesake, Saint Magnus, he
shall drink off the yawl full of punch, unless he gives us a song on the
spot!”</p>
<p>“Too much water drowned the miller,” answered Triptolemus. “My brain has
more need of draining than of being drenched with more liquor.”</p>
<p>“Sing, then,” said the despotic landlord, “for no one shall speak any
other language here, save honest Norse, jolly Dutch, or Danske, or broad
Scots, at the least of it. So, Eric Scambester, produce the yawl, and
fill it to the brim, as a charge for demurrage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Ere the vessel could reach the agriculturist, he, seeing it under way,
and steering towards him by short tacks, (for Scambester himself was by
this time not over steady in his course,) made a desperate effort, and
began to sing, or rather to croak forth, a Yorkshire harvest-home
ballad, which his father used to sing when he was a little mellow, and
which went to the tune of “Hey Dobbin, away with the waggon.” The rueful
aspect of the singer, and the desperately discordant tones of his voice,
formed so delightful a contrast with the jollity of the words and tune,
that honest Triptolemus afforded the same sort of amusement which a
reveller might give, by appearing on a festival-day in the holyday-coat
of his grandfather. The jest concluded the evening, for even the mighty
and strong-headed Magnus himself had confessed the influence of the
sleepy god. The guests went off as they best might, each to his separate
crib and resting place, and in a short time the mansion, which was of
late so noisy, was hushed into perfect silence.</p>

</p>
<p>The morning which succeeds such a feast as that of Magnus Troil, usually
lacks a little of the zest which seasoned the revels of the preceding
day, as the fashionable reader may have observed at a public breakfast
during the race-week in a country town; for, in what is called the best
society, these lingering moments are usually spent by the company, each
apart in their own dressing-rooms. At Burgh-Westra, it will readily be
believed, no such space for retirement was afforded; and the lasses,
with their paler cheeks, the elder dames, with many a wink and yawn,
were compelled to meet with their male companions (headaches and all)
just three hours after they had parted from each other.</p>
<p>Eric Scambester had done all that man could do to supply the full means
of diverting the ennui of the morning meal. The board groaned with
rounds of hung beef, made after the fashion of Zetland—with
pasties—with baked meats—with fish, dressed and cured in every
possible manner; nay, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> foreign delicacies of tea, coffee, and
chocolate; for, as we have already had occasion to remark, the situation
of these islands made them early acquainted with various articles of
foreign luxury, which were, as yet, but little known in Scotland, where,
at a much later period than that we write of, one pound of green tea was
dressed like cabbage, and another converted into a vegetable sauce for
salt beef, by the ignorance of the good housewives to whom they had been
sent as rare presents.</p>
<p>Besides these preparations, the table exhibited whatever mighty potions
are resorted to by <i>bons vivans</i>, under the facetious name of a “hair of
the dog that bit you.” There was the potent Irish Usquebaugh—right
Nantz—genuine Schiedamm—Aquavitæ from Caithness—and Golden Wasser
from Hamburgh; there was rum of formidable antiquity, and cordials from
the Leeward Islands. After these details, it were needless to mention
the stout home-brewed ale—the German mum, and Schwartz beer—and still
more would it be beneath our dignity to dwell upon the innumerable sorts
of pottage and flummery, together with the bland, and various
preparations of milk, for those who preferred thinner potations.</p>
<p>No wonder that the sight of so much good cheer awakened the appetite and
raised the spirits of the fatigued revellers. The young men began
immediately to seek out their partners of the preceding evening, and to
renew the small talk which had driven the night so merrily away; while
Magnus, with his stout old Norse kindred, encouraged, by precept and
example, those of elder days and graver mood, to a substantial
flirtation with the good things before them. Still, however, there was
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> long period to be filled up before dinner; for the most protracted
breakfast cannot well last above an hour; and it was to be feared that
Claud Halcro meditated the occupation of this vacant morning with a
formidable recitation of his own verses, besides telling, at its full
length, the whole history of his introduction to glorious John Dryden.
But fortune relieved the guests of Burgh-Westra from this threatened
infliction, by sending them means of amusement peculiarly suited to
their taste and habits.</p>
<p>Most of the guests were using their toothpicks, some were beginning to
talk of what was to be done next, when, with haste in his step, fire in
his eye, and a harpoon in his hand, Eric Scambester came to announce to
the company, that there was a whale on shore, or nearly so, at the
throat of the voe! Then you might have seen such a joyous, boisterous,
and universal bustle, as only the love of sport, so deeply implanted in
our nature, can possibly inspire. A set of country squires, about to
beat for the first woodcocks of the season, were a comparison as petty,
in respect to the glee, as in regard to the importance of the object;
the battue, upon a strong cover in Ettrick Forest, for the destruction
of the foxes;<a id="FNanchor_M_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_M_56">(<i>m</i>)</a> the insurrection of the sportsmen of the Lennox, when
one of the Duke’s deer gets out from Inch-Mirran; nay, the joyous rally
of the fox-chase itself, with all its blithe accompaniments of hound and
horn, fall infinitely short of the animation with which the gallant sons
of Thule set off to encounter the monster, whom the sea had sent for
their amusement at so opportune a conjuncture.</p>
<p>The multifarious stores of Burgh-Westra were rummaged hastily for all
sorts of arms, which could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> be used on such an occasion. Harpoons,
swords, pikes, and halberds, fell to the lot of some; others contented
themselves with hay-forks, spits, and whatever else could be found, that
was at once long and sharp. Thus hastily equipped, one division, under
the command of Captain Cleveland, hastened to man the boats which lay in
the little haven, while the rest of the party hurried by land to the
scene of action.</p>
<p>Poor Triptolemus was interrupted in a plan, which he, too, had formed
against the patience of the Zetlanders, and which was to have consisted
in a lecture upon the agriculture, and the capabilities of the country,
by this sudden hubbub, which put an end at once to Halcro’s poetry, and
to his no less formidable prose. It may be easily imagined, that he took
very little interest in the sport which was so suddenly substituted for
his lucubrations, and he would not even have deigned to have looked upon
the active scene which was about to take place, had he not been
stimulated thereunto by the exhortations of Mistress Baby. “Pit yoursell
forward, man,” said that provident person, “pit yoursell forward—wha
kens whare a blessing may light?—they say that a’ men share and share
equals-aquals in the creature’s ulzie, and a pint o’t wad be worth
siller, to light the cruise in the lang dark nights that they speak of.
Pit yoursell forward, man—there’s a graip to ye—faint heart never wan
fair lady—wha kens but what, when it’s fresh, it may eat weel eneugh,
and spare butter?”</p>
<p>What zeal was added to Triptolemus’s motions, by the prospect of eating
fresh train-oil, instead of butter, we know not; but, as better might
not be, he brandished the rural implement (a stable-fork)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> with which he
was armed, and went down to wage battle with the whale.</p>
<p>The situation in which the enemy’s ill fate had placed him, was
particularly favourable to the enterprise of the islanders. A tide of
unusual height had carried the animal over a large bar of sand, into the
voe or creek in which he was now lying. So soon as he found the water
ebbing, he became sensible of his danger, and had made desperate efforts
to get over the shallow water, where the waves broke on the bar; but
hitherto he had rather injured than mended his condition, having got
himself partly aground, and lying therefore particularly exposed to the
meditated attack. At this moment the enemy came down upon him. The front
ranks consisted of the young and hardy, armed in the miscellaneous
manner we have described; while, to witness and animate their efforts,
the young women, and the elderly persons of both sexes, took their place
among the rocks, which overhung the scene of action.</p>
<p>As the boats had to double a little headland, ere they opened the mouth
of the voe, those who came by land to the shores of the inlet, had time
to make the necessary reconnoissances upon the force and situation of
the enemy, on whom they were about to commence a simultaneous attack by
land and sea.</p>
<p>This duty, the stout-hearted and experienced general, for so the Udaller
might be termed, would intrust to no eyes but his own; and, indeed, his
external appearance, and his sage conduct, rendered him alike qualified
for the command which he enjoyed. His gold-laced hat was exchanged for a
bearskin cap, his suit of blue broadcloth, with its scarlet lining, and
loops, and frogs of bullion, had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> place to a red flannel jacket,
with buttons of black horn, over which he wore a seal-skin shirt
curiously seamed and plaited on the bosom, such as are used by the
Esquimaux, and sometimes by the Greenland whale-fishers. Sea-boots of a
formidable size completed his dress, and in his hand he held a large
whaling-knife, which he brandished, as if impatient to employ it in the
operation of <i>flinching</i> the huge animal which lay before them,—that
is, the act of separating its flesh from its bones. Upon closer
examination, however, he was obliged to confess, that the sport to which
he had conducted his friends, however much it corresponded with the
magnificent scale of his hospitality, was likely to be attended with its
own peculiar dangers and difficulties.</p>
<p>The animal, upwards of sixty feet in length, was lying perfectly still,
in a deep part of the voe into which it had weltered, and where it
seemed to await the return of tide, of which it was probably assured by
instinct. A council of experienced harpooners was instantly called, and
it was agreed that an effort should be made to noose the tail of this
torpid leviathan, by casting a cable around it, to be made fast by
anchors to the shore, and thus to secure against his escape, in case the
tide should make before they were able to dispatch him. Three boats were
destined to this delicate piece of service, one of which the Udaller
himself proposed to command, while Cleveland and Mertoun were to direct
the two others. This being decided, they sat down on the strand, waiting
with impatience until the naval part of the force should arrive in the
voe. It was during this interval, that Triptolemus Yellowley, after
measuring with his eyes the extraordinary size of the whale, observed,
that in his poor mind, “A wain with six owsen, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> with sixty owsen
either, if they were the owsen of the country, could not drag siccan a
huge creature from the water, where it was now lying, to the sea-beach.”</p>
<p>Trifling as this remark may seem to the reader, it was connected with a
subject which always fired the blood of the old Udaller, who, glancing
upon Triptolemus a quick and stern look, asked him what the devil it
signified, supposing a hundred oxen could not drag the whale upon the
beach? Mr. Yellowley, though not much liking the tone with which the
question was put, felt that his dignity and his profit compelled him to
answer as follows:—“Nay, sir—you know yoursell, Master Magnus Troil,
and every one knows that knows any thing, that whales of siccan size as
may not be masterfully dragged on shore by the instrumentality of one
wain with six owsen, are the right and property of the Admiral, who is
at this time the same noble lord who is, moreover, Chamberlain of these
isles.”</p>
<p>“And I tell you, Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley,” said the Udaller, “as I
would tell your master if he were here, that every man who risks his
life to bring that fish ashore, shall have an equal share and partition,
according to our ancient and loveable Norse custom and wont; nay, if
there is so much as a woman looking on, that will but touch the cable,
she will be partner with us; ay, and more than all that, if she will but
say there is a reason for it, we will assign a portion to the babe that
is unborn.”<a id="FNanchor_N_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_N_57">(<i>n</i>)</a></p>
<p>The strict principle of equity, which dictated this last arrangement,
occasioned laughter among the men, and some slight confusion among the
women. The factor, however, thought it shame to be so easily daunted.
“<i>Suum cuique tribuito</i>,” said he; “I will stand for my lord’s right and
my own.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Will you?” replied Magnus; “then, by the Martyr’s bones, you shall have
no law of partition but that of God and Saint Olave, which we had before
either factor, or treasurer, or chamberlain were heard of!—All shall
share that lend a hand, and never a one else. So you, Master Factor,
shall be busy as well as other folk, and think yourself lucky to share
like other folk. Jump into that boat,” (for the boats had by this time
pulled round the headland,) “and you, my lads, make way for the factor
in the stern-sheets—he shall be the first man this blessed day that
shall strike the fish.”</p>
<p>The loud authoritative voice, and the habit of absolute command inferred
in the Udaller’s whole manner, together with the conscious want of
favourers and backers amongst the rest of the company, rendered it
difficult for Triptolemus to evade compliance, although he was thus
about to be placed in a situation equally novel and perilous. He was
still, however, hesitating, and attempting an explanation, with a voice
in which anger was qualified by fear, and both thinly disguised under an
attempt to be jocular, and to represent the whole as a jest, when he
heard the voice of Baby maundering in his ear,—“Wad he lose his share
of the ulzie, and the lang Zetland winter coming on, when the lightest
day in December is not so clear as a moonless night in the Mearns?”</p>
<p>This domestic instigation, in addition to those of fear of the Udaller,
and shame to seem less courageous than others, so inflamed the
agriculturist’s spirits, that he shook his <i>graip</i> aloft, and entered
the boat with the air of Neptune himself, carrying on high his trident.</p>
<p>The three boats destined for this perilous service,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> now approached the
dark mass, which lay like an islet in the deepest part of the voe, and
suffered them to approach without showing any sign of animation.
Silently, and with such precaution as the extreme delicacy of the
operation required, the intrepid adventurers, after the failure of their
first attempt, and the expenditure of considerable time, succeeded in
casting a cable around the body of the torpid monster, and in carrying
the ends of it ashore, when an hundred hands were instantly employed in
securing them. But ere this was accomplished, the tide began to make
fast, and the Udaller informed his assistants, that either the fish must
be killed, or at least greatly wounded, ere the depth of water on the
bar was sufficient to float him; or that he was not unlikely to escape
from their joint prowess.</p>
<p>“Wherefore,” said he, “we must set to work, and the factor shall have
the honour to make the first throw.”</p>
<p>The valiant Triptolemus caught the word; and it is necessary to say that
the patience of the whale, in suffering himself to be noosed without
resistance, had abated his terrors, and very much lowered the creature
in his opinion. He protested the fish had no more wit, and scarcely more
activity, than a black snail; and, influenced by this undue contempt of
the adversary, he waited neither for a further signal, nor a better
weapon, nor a more suitable position, but, rising in his energy, hurled
his graip with all his force against the unfortunate monster. The boats
had not yet retreated from him to the distance necessary to ensure
safety, when this injudicious commencement of the war took place.</p>
<p>Magnus Troil, who had only jested with the factor, and had reserved the
launching the first spear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> against the whale to some much more skilful
hand, had just time to exclaim, “Mind yourselves, lads, or we are all
swamped!” when the monster, roused at once from inactivity by the blow
of the factor’s missile, blew, with a noise resembling the explosion of
a steam-engine, a huge shower of water into the air, and at the same
time began to lash the waves with his tail in every direction. The boat
in which Magnus presided received the shower of brine which the animal
spouted aloft; and the adventurous Triptolemus, who had a full share of
the immersion, was so much astonished and terrified by the consequences
of his own valorous deed, that he tumbled backwards amongst the feet of
the people, who, too busy to attend to him, were actively engaged in
getting the boat into shoal water, out of the whale’s reach. Here he lay
for some minutes, trampled on by the feet of the boatmen, until they lay
on their oars to bale, when the Udaller ordered them to pull to shore,
and land this spare hand, who had commenced the fishing so
inauspiciously.</p>
<p>While this was doing, the other boats had also pulled off to safer
distance, and now, from these as well as from the shore, the unfortunate
native of the deep was overwhelmed by all kinds of missiles,—harpoons
and spears flew against him on all sides—guns were fired, and each
various means of annoyance plied which could excite him to exhaust his
strength in useless rage. When the animal found that he was locked in by
shallows on all sides, and became sensible, at the same time, of the
strain of the cable on his body, the convulsive efforts which he made to
escape, accompanied with sounds resembling deep and loud groans, would
have moved the compassion of all but a practised whale-fisher. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
repeated showers which he spouted into the air began now to be mingled
with blood, and the waves which surrounded him assumed the same crimson
appearance. Meantime the attempts of the assailants were redoubled; but
Mordaunt Mertoun and Cleveland, in particular, exerted themselves to the
uttermost, contending who should display most courage in approaching the
monster, so tremendous in its agonies, and should inflict the most deep
and deadly wounds upon its huge bulk.</p>
<p>The contest seemed at last pretty well over; for although the animal
continued from time to time to make frantic exertions for liberty, yet
its strength appeared so much exhausted, that, even with the assistance
of the tide, which had now risen considerably, it was thought it could
scarcely extricate itself.</p>
<p>Magnus gave the signal to venture nearer to the whale, calling out at
the same time, “Close in, lads, he is not half so mad now—The Factor
may look for a winter’s oil for the two lamps at Harfra—Pull close in,
lads.”</p>
<p>Ere his orders could be obeyed, the other two boats had anticipated his
purpose; and Mordaunt Mertoun, eager to distinguish himself above
Cleveland, had, with the whole strength he possessed, plunged a
half-pike into the body of the animal. But the leviathan, like a nation
whose resources appear totally exhausted by previous losses and
calamities, collected his whole remaining force for an effort, which
proved at once desperate and successful. The wound, last received, had
probably reached through his external defences of blubber, and attained
some very sensitive part of the system; for he roared aloud, as he sent
to the sky a mingled sheet of brine and blood, and snapping the strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
cable like a twig, overset Mertoun’s boat with a blow of his tail, shot
himself, by a mighty effort, over the bar, upon which the tide had now
risen considerably, and made out to sea, carrying with him a whole grove
of the implements which had been planted in his body, and leaving behind
him, on the waters, a dark red trace of his course.</p>
<p>“There goes to sea your cruise of oil, Master Yellowley,” said Magnus,
“and you must consume mutton suet, or go to bed in the dark.”</p>
<p>“<i>Operam et oleum perdidi</i>,” muttered Triptolemus; “but if they catch me
whale-fishing again, I will consent that the fish shall swallow me as he
did Jonah.”</p>
<p>“But where is Mordaunt Mertoun all this while?” exclaimed Claud Halcro;
and it was instantly perceived that the youth, who had been stunned when
his boat was stove, was unable to swim to shore as the other sailors
did, and now floated senseless upon the waves.</p>
<p>We have noticed the strange and inhuman prejudice, which rendered the
Zetlanders of that period unwilling to assist those whom they saw in the
act of drowning, though that is the calamity to which the islanders are
most frequently exposed. Three men, however, soared above this
superstition. The first was Claud Halcro, who threw himself from a small
rock headlong into the waves, forgetting, as he himself afterwards
stated, that he could not swim, and, if possessed of the harp of Arion,
had no dolphins in attendance. The first plunge which the poet made in
deep water, reminding him of these deficiencies, he was fain to cling to
the rock from which he had dived, and was at length glad to regain the
shore, at the expense of a ducking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>Magnus Troil, whose honest heart forgot his late coolness towards
Mordaunt, when he saw the youth’s danger, would instantly have brought
him more effectual aid, but Eric Scambester held him fast.</p>
<p>“Hout, sir—hout,” exclaimed that faithful attendant—“Captain Cleveland
has a grip of Mr. Mordaunt—just let the twa strangers help ilk other,
and stand by the upshot. The light of the country is not to be quenched
for the like of them. Bide still, sir, I say—Bredness Voe is not a bowl
of punch, that a man can be fished out of like a toast with a long
spoon.”</p>
<p>This sage remonstrance would have been altogether lost upon Magnus, had
he not observed that Cleveland had in fact jumped out of the boat, and
swum to Mertoun’s assistance, and was keeping him afloat till the boat
came to the aid of both. As soon as the immediate danger which called so
loudly for assistance was thus ended, the honest Udaller’s desire to
render aid terminated also; and recollecting the cause of offence which
he had, or thought he had, against Mordaunt Mertoun, he shook off his
butler’s hold, and turning round scornfully from the beach, called Eric
an old fool for supposing that he cared whether the young fellow sank or
swam.</p>
<p>Still, however, amid his assumed indifference, Magnus could not help
peeping over the heads of the circle, which, surrounding Mordaunt as
soon as he was brought on shore, were charitably employed in
endeavouring to recall him to life; and he was not able to attain the
appearance of absolute unconcern, until the young man sat up on the
beach, and showed plainly that the accident had been attended with no
material consequences. It was then first that, cursing the assistants
for not giving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> lad a glass of brandy, he walked sullenly away, as
if totally unconcerned in his fate.</p>
<p>The women, always accurate in observing the telltale emotions of each
other, failed not to remark, that when the sisters of Burgh-Westra saw
Mordaunt immersed in the waves, Minna grew as pale as death, while
Brenda uttered successive shrieks of terror. But though there were some
nods, winks, and hints that auld acquaintance were not easily forgot, it
was, on the whole, candidly admitted, that less than such marks of
interest could scarce have been expected, when they saw the companion of
their early youth in the act of perishing before their eyes.</p>
<p>Whatever interest Mordaunt’s condition excited while it seemed perilous,
began to abate as he recovered himself; and when his senses were fully
restored, only Claud Halcro, with two or three others, were standing by
him. About ten paces off stood Cleveland—his hair and clothes dropping
water, and his features wearing so peculiar an expression, as
immediately to arrest the attention of Mordaunt. There was a suppressed
smile on his cheek, and a look of pride in his eye, that implied
liberation from a painful restraint, and something resembling gratified
scorn. Claud Halcro hastened to intimate to Mordaunt, that he owed his
life to Cleveland; and the youth, rising from the ground, and losing all
other feelings in those of gratitude, stepped forward with his hand
stretched out, to offer his warmest thanks to his preserver. But he
stopped short in surprise, as Cleveland, retreating a pace or two,
folded his arms on his breast, and declined to accept his proffered
hand. He drew back in turn, and gazed with astonishment at the
ungracious manner, and almost insulting look, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> which Cleveland, who
had formerly rather expressed a frank cordiality, or at least openness
of bearing, now, after having thus rendered him a most important
service, chose to receive his thanks.</p>
<p>“It is enough,” said Cleveland, observing his surprise, “and it is
unnecessary to say more about it. I have paid back my debt, and we are
now equal.”</p>
<p>“You are more than equal with me, Captain Cleveland,” answered Mertoun,
“because you endangered your life to do for me what I did for you
without the slightest risk;—besides,” he added, trying to give the
discourse a more pleasant turn, “I have your rifle-gun to boot.”</p>
<p>“Cowards only count danger for any point of the game,” said Cleveland.
“Danger has been my consort for life, and sailed with me on a thousand
worse voyages;—and for rifles, I have enough of my own, and you may
see, when you will, which can use them best.”</p>
<p>There was something in the tone with which this was said, that struck
Mordaunt strongly; it was miching malicho, as Hamlet says, and meant
mischief. Cleveland saw his surprise, came close up to him, and spoke in
a low tone of voice:—“Hark ye, my young brother. There is a custom
among us gentlemen of fortune, that when we follow the same chase, and
take the wind out of each other’s sails, we think sixty yards of the
sea-beach, and a brace of rifles, are no bad way of making our odds
even.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand you, Captain Cleveland,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“I do not suppose you do,—I did not suppose you would,” said the
Captain; and, turning on his heel, with a smile that resembled a sneer,
Mordaunt saw him mingle with the guests, and very soon beheld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> him at
the side of Minna, who was talking to him with animated features, that
seemed to thank him for his gallant and generous conduct.</p>
<p>“If it were not for Brenda,” thought Mordaunt, “I almost wish he had
left me in the voe, for no one seems to care whether I am alive or
dead.—Two rifles and sixty yards of sea-beach—is that what he points
at?—It may come,—but not on the day he has saved my life with risk of
his own.”</p>
<p>While he was thus musing, Eric Scambester was whispering to Halcro, “If
these two lads do not do each other a mischief, there is no faith in
freits. Master Mordaunt saves Cleveland,—well.—Cleveland, in requital,
has turned all the sunshine of Burgh-Westra to his own side of the
house; and think what it is to lose favour in such a house as this,
where the punch-kettle is never allowed to cool! Well, now that
Cleveland in his turn has been such a fool as to fish Mordaunt out of
the voe, see if he does not give him sour sillocks for stock-fish.”</p>
<p>“Pshaw, pshaw!” replied the poet, “that is all old women’s fancies, my
friend Eric; for what says glorious Dryden—sainted John,—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘The yellow gall that in your bosom floats,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Engenders all these melancholy thoughts.’”</span><br>
</p>
<p>“Saint John, or Saint James either, may be mistaken in the matter,” said
Eric; “for I think neither of them lived in Zetland. I only say, that if
there is faith in old saws, these two lads will do each other a
mischief; and if they do, I trust it will light on Mordaunt Mertoun.”</p>
<p>“And why, Eric Scambester,” said Halcro, hastily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> and angrily, “should
you wish ill to that poor young man, that is worth fifty of the other?”</p>
<p>“Let every one roose the ford as he finds it,” replied Eric; “Master
Mordaunt is all for wan water, like his old dog-fish of a father; now
Captain Cleveland, d’ye see, takes his glass, like an honest fellow and
a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“Rightly reasoned, and in thine own division,” said Halcro; and breaking
off their conversation, took his way back to Burgh-Westra, to which the
guests of Magnus were now returning, discussing as they went, with much
animation, the various incidents of their attack upon the whale, and not
a little scandalized that it should have baffled all their exertions.</p>
<p>“I hope Captain Donderdrecht of the Eintracht of Rotterdam will never
hear of it,” said Magnus; “he would swear, donner and blitzen, we were
only fit to fish flounders.”<a id="FNanchor_46_58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46_58">[46]</a></p>

</p>
<p>Fortune, who seems at times to bear a conscience, owed the hospitable
Udaller some amends, and accordingly repaid to Burgh-Westra the
disappointment occasioned by the unsuccessful whale-fishing, by sending
thither, on the evening of the day in which that incident happened, no
less a person than the jagger, or travelling merchant, as he styled
himself, Bryce Snailsfoot, who arrived in great pomp, himself on one
pony, and his pack of goods, swelled to nearly double its usual size,
forming the burden of another, which was led by a bare-headed
bare-legged boy.</p>
<p>As Bryce announced himself the bearer of important news, he was
introduced to the dining apartment, where (for that primitive age was no
respecter of persons) he was permitted to sit down at a side-table, and
amply supplied with provisions and good liquor; while the attentive
hospitality of Magnus permitted no questions to be put to him, until,
his hunger and thirst appeased, he announced, with the sense of
importance attached to distant travels, that he had just yesterday
arrived at Lerwick from Kirkwall, the capital of Orkney, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
been here yesterday, but it blew hard off the Fitful-head.</p>
<p>“We had no wind here,” said Magnus.</p>
<p>“There is somebody has not been sleeping, then,” said the pedlar, “and
her name begins with N; but Heaven is above all.”</p>
<p>“But the news from Orkney, Bryce, instead of croaking about a capful of
wind?”</p>
<p>“Such news,” replied Bryce, “as has not been heard this thirty
years—not since Cromwell’s time.”</p>
<p>“There is not another Revolution, is there?” said Halcro; “King James
has not come back, as blithe as King Charlie did, has he?”</p>
<p>“It’s news,” replied the pedlar, “that are worth twenty kings, and
kingdoms to boot of them; for what good did the evolutions ever do us?
and I dare say we have seen a dozen, great and sma’.”</p>
<p>“Are any Indiamen come north about?” said Magnus Troil.</p>
<p>“Ye are nearer the mark, Fowd,” said the jagger; “but it is nae
Indiaman, but a gallant armed vessel, chokeful of merchandise, that they
part with so easy that a decent man like my sell can afford to give the
country the best pennyworths you ever saw; and that you will say, when I
open that pack, for I count to carry it back another sort lighter than
when I brought it here.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay, Bryce,” said the Udaller, “you must have had good bargains if
you sell cheap; but what ship was it?”</p>
<p>“Cannot justly say—I spoke to nobody but the captain, who was a
discreet man; but she had been down on the Spanish Main, for she has
silks and satins, and tobacco, I warrant you, and wine, and no lack of
sugar, and bonny-wallies baith of silver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> and gowd, and a bonnie
dredging of gold dust into the bargain.”</p>
<p>“What like was she?” said Cleveland, who seemed to give much attention.</p>
<p>“A stout ship,” said the itinerant merchant, “schooner-rigged, sails
like a dolphin, they say, carries twelve guns, and is pierced for
twenty.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear the captain’s name?” said Cleveland, speaking rather lower
than his usual tone.</p>
<p>“I just ca’d him the Captain,” replied Bryce Snailsfoot; “for I make it
a rule never to ask questions of them I deal with in the way of trade;
for there is many an honest captain, begging your pardon, Captain
Cleveland, that does not care to have his name tacked to his title; and
as lang as we ken what bargains we are making, what signifies it wha we
are making them wi’, ye ken?”</p>
<p>“Bryce Snailsfoot is a cautious man,” said the Udaller, laughing; “he
knows a fool may ask more questions than a wise man cares to answer.”</p>
<p>“I have dealt with the fair traders in my day,” replied Snailsfoot, “and
I ken nae use in blurting braid out with a man’s name at every moment;
but I will uphold this gentleman to be a gallant commander—ay, and a
kind one too; for every one of his crew is as brave in apparel as
himself nearly—the very foremast-men have their silken scarfs; I have
seen many a lady wear a warse, and think hersell nae sma’ drink—and for
siller buttons, and buckles, and the lave of sic vanities, there is nae
end of them.”</p>
<p>“Idiots!” muttered Cleveland between his teeth; and then added, “I
suppose they are often ashore, to show all their bravery to the lasses
of Kirkwall?”</p>
<p>“Ne’er a bit of that are they. The Captain will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> scarce let them stir
ashore without the boatswain go in the boat—as rough a tarpaulin as
ever swabb’d a deck—and you may as weel catch a cat without her claws,
as him without his cutlass and his double brace of pistols about him;
every man stands as much in awe of him as of the commander himsell.”</p>
<p>“That must be Hawkins, or the devil,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Aweel, Captain,” replied the jagger, “be he the tane or the tither, or
a wee bit o’ baith, mind it is you that give him these names, and not
I.”</p>
<p>“Why, Captain Cleveland,” said the Udaller, “this may prove the very
consort you spoke of.”</p>
<p>“They must have had some good luck, then,” said Cleveland, “to put them
in better plight than when I left them.—Did they speak of having lost
their consort, pedlar?”</p>
<p>“In troth did they,” said Bryce; “that is, they said something about a
partner that had gone down to Davie Jones in these seas.”</p>
<p>“And did you tell them what you knew of her?” said the Udaller.</p>
<p>“And wha the deevil wad hae been the fule, then,” said the pedlar, “that
I suld say sae? When they kend what came of the ship, the next question
wad have been about the cargo,—and ye wad not have had me bring down an
armed vessel on the coast, to harrie the poor folk about a wheen rags of
duds that the sea flung upon their shores?”</p>
<p>“Besides, what might have been found in your own pack, you scoundrel!”
said Magnus Troil; an observation which produced a loud laugh. The
Udaller could not help joining in the hilarity which applauded his jest;
but instantly composing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> countenance, he said, in an unusually grave
tone, “You may laugh, my friends; but this is a matter which brings both
a curse and a shame on the country; and till we learn to regard the
rights of them that suffer by the winds and waves, we shall deserve to
be oppressed and hag-ridden, as we have been and are, by the superior
strength of the strangers who rule us.”</p>
<p>The company hung their heads at the rebuke of Magnus Troil. Perhaps
some, even of the better class, might be conscience-struck on their own
account; and all of them were sensible that the appetite for plunder, on
the part of the tenants and inferiors, was not at all times restrained
with sufficient strictness. But Cleveland made answer gaily, “If these
honest fellows be my comrades, I will answer for them that they will
never trouble the country about a parcel of chests, hammocks, and such
trumpery, that the Roost may have washed ashore out of my poor sloop.
What signifies to them whether the trash went to Bryce Snailsfoot, or to
the bottom, or to the devil? So unbuckle thy pack, Bryce, and show the
ladies thy cargo, and perhaps we may see something that will please
them.”</p>
<p>“It cannot be his consort,” said Brenda, in a whisper to her sister; “he
would have shown more joy at her appearance.”</p>
<p>“It must be the vessel,” answered Minna; “I saw his eye glisten at the
thought of being again united to the partner of his dangers.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it glistened,” said her sister, still apart, “at the thought of
leaving Zetland; it is difficult to guess the thought of the heart from
the glance of the eye.”</p>
<p>“Judge not, at least, unkindly of a friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>’s thought,” said Minna; “and
then, Brenda, if you are mistaken, the fault rests not with you.”</p>
<p>During this dialogue, Bryce Snailsfoot was busied in uncoiling the
carefully arranged cordage of his pack, which amounted to six good yards
of dressed seal-skin, curiously complicated and secured by all manner of
knots and buckles. He was considerably interrupted in the task by the
Udaller and others, who pressed him with questions respecting the
stranger vessel.</p>
<p>“Were the officers often ashore? and how were they received by the
people of Kirkwall?” said Magnus Troil.</p>
<p>“Excellently well,” answered Bryce Snailsfoot; “and the Captain and one
or two of his men had been at some of the vanities and dances which went
forward in the town; but there had been some word about customs, or
king’s duties, or the like, and some of the higher folk, that took upon
them as magistrates, or the like, had had words with the Captain, and he
refused to satisfy them; and then it is like he was more coldly looked
on, and he spoke of carrying the ship round to Stromness, or the
Langhope, for she lay under the guns of the battery at Kirkwall. But he”
(Bryce) “thought she wad bide at Kirkwall till the summer-fair was over,
for all that.”</p>
<p>“The Orkney gentry,” said Magnus Troil, “are always in a hurry to draw
the Scotch collar tighter round their own necks. Is it not enough that
we must pay <i>scat</i> and <i>wattle,</i> which were all the public dues under
our old Norse government; but must they come over us with king’s dues
and customs besides? It is the part of an honest man to resist these
things. I have done so all my life, and will do so to the end of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>”</p>
<p>There was a loud jubilee and shout of applause among the guests, who
were (some of them at least) better pleased with Magnus Troil’s
latitudinarian principles with respect to the public revenue, (which
were extremely natural to those living in so secluded a situation, and
subjected to many additional exactions,) than they had been with the
rigour of his judgment on the subject of wrecked goods. But Minna’s
inexperienced feelings carried her farther than her father, while she
whispered to Brenda, not unheard by Cleveland, that the tame spirit of
the Orcadians had missed every chance which late incidents had given
them to emancipate these islands from the Scottish yoke.</p>
<p>“Why,” she said, “should we not, under so many changes as late times
have introduced, have seized the opportunity to shake off an allegiance
which is not justly due from us, and to return to the protection of
Denmark, our parent country? Why should we yet hesitate to do this, but
that the gentry of Orkney have mixed families and friendship so much
with our invaders, that they have become dead to the throb of the heroic
Norse blood, which they derived from their ancestors?”</p>
<p>The latter part of this patriotic speech happened to reach the
astonished ears of our friend Triptolemus, who, having a sincere
devotion for the Protestant succession, and the Revolution as
established, was surprised into the ejaculation, “As the old cock crows
the young cock learns—hen I should say, mistress, and I crave your
pardon if I say any thing amiss in either gender. But it is a happy
country where the father declares against the king’s customs, and the
daughter against the king’s crown! and, in my judgment, it can end in
naething but trees and tows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Trees are scarce among us,” said Magnus; “and for ropes, we need them
for our rigging, and cannot spare them to be shirt-collars.”</p>
<p>“And whoever,” said the Captain, “takes umbrage at what this young lady
says, had better keep his ears and tongue for a safer employment than
such an adventure.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said Triptolemus, “it helps the matter much to speak truths,
whilk are as unwelcome to a proud stomach as wet clover to a cow’s, in a
land where lads are ready to draw the whittle if a lassie but looks
awry. But what manners are to be expected in a country where folk call a
pleugh-sock a markal?”</p>
<p>“Hark ye, Master Yellowley,” said the Captain, smiling, “I hope my
manners are not among those abuses which you come hither to reform; any
experiment on them may be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“As well as difficult,” said Triptolemus, dryly; “but fear nothing,
Captain Cleveland, from my remonstrances. My labours regard the men and
things of the earth, and not the men and things of the sea,—you are not
of my element.”</p>
<p>“Let us be friends, then, old clod-compeller,” said the Captain.</p>
<p>“Clod-compeller!” said the agriculturist, bethinking himself of the
lore of his earlier days; “Clod-compeller <i>pro</i> cloud-compeller,
Νεφεληγερέτα
Ζευς<a id="FNanchor_O_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_O_59">(<i>o</i>)</a>—<i>Græcum
est</i>,—in which voyage came you by that phrase?”</p>
<p>“I have travelled books as well as seas in my day,” said the Captain;
“but my last voyages have been of a sort to make me forget my early
cruizes through classic knowledge.—But come here, Bryce,—hast cast off
the lashing?—Come all hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> let us see if he has aught in his
cargo that is worth looking upon.”</p>
<p>With a proud, and, at the same time, a wily smile, did the crafty pedlar
display a collection of wares far superior to those which usually filled
his packages, and, in particular, some stuffs and embroideries, of such
beauty and curiosity, fringed, flowered, and worked, with such art and
magnificence, upon foreign and arabesque patterns, that the sight might
have dazzled a far more brilliant company than the simple race of Thule.
All beheld and admired, while Mistress Baby Yellowley, holding up her
hands, protested it was a sin even to look upon such extravagance, and
worse than murder so much as to ask the price of them.</p>
<p>Others, however, were more courageous; and the prices demanded by the
merchant, if they were not, as he himself declared, something just more
than nothing—short only of an absolute free gift of his wares, were
nevertheless so moderate, as to show that he himself must have made an
easy acquisition of the goods, judging by the rate at which he offered
to part with them. Accordingly, the cheapness of the articles created a
rapid sale; for in Zetland, as well as elsewhere, wise folk buy more
from the prudential desire to secure a good bargain, than from any real
occasion for the purchase. The Lady Glowrowrum bought seven petticoats
and twelve stomachers on this sole principle, and other matrons present
rivalled her in this sagacious species of economy. The Udaller was also
a considerable purchaser; but the principal customer for whatever could
please the eye of beauty, was the gallant Captain Cleveland, who
rummaged the jagger’s stores in selecting presents for the ladies of the
party,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> in which Minna and Brenda Troil were especially remembered.</p>
<p>“I fear,” said Magnus Troil, “that the young women are to consider these
pretty presents as keepsakes, and that all this liberality is only a
sure sign we are soon to lose you?”</p>
<p>This question seemed to embarrass him to whom it was put.</p>
<p>“I scarce know,” he said with some hesitation, “whether this vessel is
my consort or no—I must take a trip to Kirkwall to make sure of that
matter, and then I hope to return to Dunrossness to bid you all
farewell.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said the Udaller, after a moment’s pause, “I think I may
carry you thither. I should be at the Kirkwall fair, to settle with the
merchants I have consigned my fish to, and I have often promised Minna
and Brenda that they should see the fair. Perhaps also your consort, or
these strangers, whoever they be, may have some merchandise that will
suit me. I love to see my rigging-loft well stocked with goods, almost
as much as to see it full of dancers. We will go to Orkney in my own
brig, and I can offer you a hammock, if you will.”</p>
<p>The offer seemed so acceptable to Cleveland, that, after pouring himself
forth in thanks, he seemed determined to mark his joy by exhausting
Bryce Snailsfoot’s treasures in liberality to the company. The contents
of a purse of gold were transferred to the jagger, with a facility and
indifference on the part of its former owner which argued either the
greatest profusion, or consciousness of superior and inexhaustible
wealth; so that Baby whispered to her brother, that, “if he could afford
to fling away money at this rate, the lad had made a better voy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>age in a
broken ship, than all the skippers of Dundee had made in their haill
anes for a twelvemonth past.”</p>
<p>But the angry feeling in which she made this remark was much mollified,
when Cleveland, whose object it seemed that evening to be, to buy golden
opinions of all sorts of men, approached her with a garment somewhat
resembling in shape the Scottish plaid, but woven of a sort of wool so
soft, that it felt to the touch as if it were composed of eider-down.
“This,” he said, “was a part of a Spanish lady’s dress, called a
<i>mantilla</i>; as it would exactly fit the size of Mrs. Baby Yellowley, and
was very well suited for the fogs of the climate of Zetland, he
entreated her to wear it for his sake.” The lady, with as much
condescending sweetness as her countenance was able to express, not only
consented to receive this mark of gallantry, but permitted the donor to
arrange the mantilla upon her projecting and bony shoulder-blades,
where, said Claud Halcro, “it hung, for all the world, as if it had been
stretched betwixt a couple of cloak-pins.”</p>
<p>While the Captain was performing this piece of courtesy, much to the
entertainment of the company, which, it may be presumed, was his
principal object from the beginning, Mordaunt Mertoun made purchase of a
small golden chaplet, with the private intention of presenting it to
Brenda, when he should find an opportunity. The price was fixed, and the
article laid aside. Claud Halcro also showed some desire of possessing a
silver box of antique shape, for depositing tobacco, which he was in the
habit of using in considerable quantity. But the bard seldom had current
coin in promptitude, and, indeed, in his wandering way of life, had
little occasion for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> any; and Bryce, on the other hand, his having been
hitherto a ready-money trade, protested, that his very moderate profits
upon such rare and choice articles, would not allow of his affording
credit to the purchaser. Mordaunt gathered the import of this
conversation from the mode in which they whispered together, while the
bard seemed to advance a wishful finger towards the box in question, and
the cautious pedlar detained it with the weight of his whole hand, as if
he had been afraid it would literally make itself wings, and fly into
Claud Halcro’s pocket. Mordaunt Mertoun at this moment, desirous to
gratify an old acquaintance, laid the price of the box on the table, and
said he would not permit Master Halcro to purchase that box, as he had
settled in his own mind to make him a present of it.</p>
<p>“I cannot think of robbing you, my dear young friend,” said the poet;
“but the truth is, that that same box does remind me strangely of
glorious John’s, out of which I had the honour to take a pinch at the
Wits’ Coffeehouse, for which I think more highly of my right-hand finger
and thumb than any other part of my body; only you must allow me to pay
you back the price when my Urkaster stock-fish come to market.”</p>
<p>“Settle that as you like betwixt you,” said the jagger, taking up
Mordaunt’s money; “the box is bought and sold.”</p>
<p>“And how dare you sell over again,” said Captain Cleveland, suddenly
interfering, “what you already have sold to me?”</p>
<p>All were surprised at this interjection, which was hastily made, as
Cleveland, having turned from Mistress Baby, had become suddenly, and,
as it seemed, not without emotion, aware what articles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> Bryce Snailsfoot
was now disposing of. To this short and fierce question, the jagger,
afraid to contradict a customer of his description, answered only by
stammering, that the “Lord knew he meant nae offence.”</p>
<p>“How, sir! no offence!” said the seaman, “and dispose of my property?”
extending his hand at the same time to the box and chaplet; “restore the
young gentleman’s money, and learn to keep your course on the meridian
of honesty.”</p>
<p>The jagger, confused and reluctant, pulled out his leathern pouch to
repay to Mordaunt the money he had just deposited in it; but the youth
was not to be so satisfied.</p>
<p>“The articles,” he said, “were bought and sold—these were your own
words, Bryce Snailsfoot, in Master Halcro’s hearing; and I will suffer
neither you nor any other to deprive me of my property.”</p>
<p>“<i>Your</i> property, young man?” said Cleveland; “It is mine,—I spoke to
Bryce respecting them an instant before I turned from the table.”</p>
<p>“I—I—I had not just heard distinctly,” said Bryce, evidently unwilling
to offend either party.</p>
<p>“Come, come,” said the Udaller, “we will have no quarrelling about
baubles; we shall be summoned presently to the rigging-loft,”—so he
used to call the apartment used as a ball-room,—“and we must all go in
good-humour. The things shall remain with Bryce for to-night, and
to-morrow I will myself settle whom they shall belong to.”</p>
<p>The laws of the Udaller in his own house were absolute as those of the
Medes. The two young men, regarding each other with looks of sullen
displeasure, drew off in different directions.</p>
<p>It is seldom that the second day of a prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> festival equals the
first. The spirits, as well as the limbs, are jaded, and unequal to the
renewed expenditure of animation and exertion; and the dance at
Burgh-Westra was sustained with much less mirth than on the preceding
evening. It was yet an hour from midnight, when even the reluctant
Magnus Troil, after regretting the degeneracy of the times, and wishing
he could transfuse into the modern Hialtlanders some of the vigour which
still animated his own frame, found himself compelled to give the signal
for general retreat.</p>
<p>Just as this took place, Halcro, leading Mordaunt Mertoun a little
aside, said he had a message to him from Captain Cleveland.</p>
<p>“A message!” said Mordaunt, his heart beating somewhat thick as he
spoke—“A challenge, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“A challenge!” repeated Halcro; “who ever heard of a challenge in our
quiet islands? Do you think that I look like a carrier of challenges,
and to you of all men living?—I am none of those fighting fools, as
glorious John calls them; and it was not quite a message I had to
deliver—only thus far—this Captain Cleveland, I find, hath set his
heart upon having these articles you looked at.”</p>
<p>“He shall not have them, I swear to you,” replied Mordaunt Mertoun.</p>
<p>“Nay, but hear me,” said Halcro; “it seems that, by the marks or arms
that are upon them, he knows that they were formerly his property. Now,
were you to give me the box, as you promised, I fairly tell you, I
should give the man back his own.”</p>
<p>“And Brenda might do the like,” thought Mordaunt to himself, and
instantly replied aloud, “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> have thought better of it, my friend.
Captain Cleveland shall have the toys he sets such store by, but it is
on one sole condition.”</p>
<p>“Nay, you will spoil all with your conditions,” said Halcro; “for, as
glorious John says, conditions are but”——</p>
<p>“Hear me, I say, with patience.—My condition is, that he keeps the toys
in exchange for the rifle-gun I accepted from him, which will leave no
obligation between us on either side.”</p>
<p>“I see where you would be—this is Sebastian and Dorax all over. Well,
you may let the jagger know he is to deliver the things to Cleveland—I
think he is mad to have them—and I will let Cleveland know the
conditions annexed, otherwise honest Bryce might come by two payments
instead of one; and I believe his conscience would not choke upon it.”</p>
<p>With these words, Halcro went to seek out Cleveland, while Mordaunt,
observing Snailsfoot, who, as a sort of privileged person, had thrust
himself into the crowd at the bottom of the dancing-room, went up to
him, and gave him directions to deliver the disputed articles to
Cleveland as soon as he had an opportunity.</p>
<p>“Ye are in the right, Maister Mordaunt,” said the jagger; “ye are a
prudent and a sensible lad—a calm answer turneth away wrath—and
mysell, I sall be willing to please you in ony trifling matters in my
sma’ way; for, between the Udaller of Burgh-Westra and Captain
Cleveland, a man is, as it were, atween the deil and the deep sea; and
it was like that the Udaller, in the end, would have taken your part in
the dispute, for he is a man that loves justice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Which apparently you care very little about, Master Snailsfoot,” said
Mordaunt, “otherwise there could have been no dispute whatever, the
right being so clearly on my side, if you had pleased to bear witness
according to the dictates of truth.”</p>
<p>“Maister Mordaunt,” said the jagger, “I must own there was, as it were,
a colouring or shadow of justice on your side; but then, the justice
that I meddle with, is only justice in the way of trade, to have an
ellwand of due length, if it be not something worn out with leaning on
it in my lang and painful journeys, and to buy and sell by just weight
and measure, twenty-four merks to the lispund; but I have nothing to do,
to do justice betwixt man and man, like a Fowd or a Lawright-man at a
lawting lang syne.”</p>
<p>“No one asked you to do so, but only to give evidence according to your
conscience,” replied Mordaunt, not greatly pleased either with the part
the jagger had acted during the dispute, or the construction which he
seemed to put on his own motives for yielding up the point.</p>
<p>But Bryce Snailsfoot wanted not his answer; “My conscience,” he said,
“Maister Mordaunt, is as tender as ony man’s in my degree; but she is
something of a timorsome nature, cannot abide angry folk, and can never
speak above her breath, when there is aught of a fray going forward.
Indeed, she hath at all times a small and low voice.”</p>
<p>“Which you are not much in the habit of listening to,” said Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“There is that on your ain breast that proves the contrary,” said Bryce,
resolutely.</p>
<p>“In my breast?” said Mordaunt, somewhat angrily,—“what know I of you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I said <i>on</i> your breast, Maister Mordaunt, and not <i>in</i> it. I am sure
nae eye that looks on that waistcoat upon your own gallant brisket, but
will say, that the merchant who sold such a piece for four dollars had
justice and conscience, and a kind heart to a customer to the boot of a’
that; sae ye shouldna be sae thrawart wi’ me for having spared the
breath of my mouth in a fool’s quarrel.”</p>
<p>“I thrawart!” said Mordaunt; “pooh, you silly man! I have no quarrel
with you.”</p>
<p>“I am glad of it,” said the travelling merchant; “I will quarrel with no
man, with my will—least of all with an old customer; and if you will
walk by my advice, you will quarrel nane with Captain Cleveland. He is
like one of yon cutters and slashers that have come into Kirkwall, that
think as little of slicing a man, as we do of flinching a whale—it’s
their trade to fight, and they live by it; and they have the advantage
of the like of you, that only take it up at your own hand, and in the
way of pastime, when you hae nothing better to do.”</p>
<p>The company had now almost all dispersed; and Mordaunt, laughing at the
jagger’s caution, bade him good-night, and went to his own place of
repose, which had been assigned to him by Eric Scambester, (who acted
the part of chamberlain as well as butler,) in a small room, or rather
closet, in one of the outhouses, furnished for the occasion with the
hammock of a sailor.</p>

</p>
<p>The daughters of Magnus Troil shared the same bed, in a chamber which
had been that of their parents before the death of their mother. Magnus,
who suffered grievously under that dispensation of Providence, had
become disgusted with the apartment. The nuptial chamber was abandoned
to the pledges of his bereaved affection, of whom the eldest was at that
period only four years old, or thereabouts; and, having been their
nursery in infancy, continued, though now tricked and adorned according
to the best fashion of the islands, and the taste of the lovely sisters
themselves, to be their sleeping-room, or, in the old Norse dialect,
their bower.</p>
<p>It had been for many years the scene of the most intimate confidence, if
that could be called confidence, where, in truth, there was nothing to
be confided; where neither sister had a secret; and where every thought
that had birth in the bosom of the one, was, without either hesitation
or doubt, confided to the other as spontaneously as it had arisen. But,
since Cleveland abode in the mansion of Burgh-Westra, each of the lovely
sisters had entertained thoughts which are not lightly or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> easily
communicated, unless she who listens to them has previously assured
herself that the confidence will be kindly received. Minna had noticed
what other and less interested observers had been unable to perceive,
that Cleveland, namely, held a lower rank in Brenda’s opinion than in
her own; and Brenda, on her side, thought that Minna had hastily and
unjustly joined in the prejudices which had been excited against
Mordaunt Mertoun in the mind of their father. Each was sensible that she
was no longer the same to her sister; and this conviction was a painful
addition to other painful apprehensions which they supposed they had to
struggle with. Their manner towards each other was, in outward
appearances, and in all the little cares by which affection can be
expressed, even more assiduously kind than before, as if both, conscious
that their internal reserve was a breach of their sisterly union, strove
to atone for it by double assiduity in those external marks of
affection, which, at other times, when there was nothing to hide, might
be omitted without inferring any consequences.</p>
<p>On the night referred to in particular, the sisters felt more especially
the decay of the confidence which used to exist betwixt them. The
proposed voyage to Kirkwall, and that at the time of the fair, when
persons of every degree in these islands repair thither, either for
business or amusement, was likely to be an important incident in lives
usually so simple and uniform as theirs; and, a few months ago, Minna
and Brenda would have been awake half the night, anticipating, in their
talk with each other, all that was likely to happen on so momentous an
occasion. But now the subject was just mentioned, and suffered to drop,
as if the topic was likely to produce a dif<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ference betwixt them, or to
call forth a more open display of their several opinions than either was
willing to make to the other.</p>
<p>Yet such was their natural openness and gentleness of disposition, that
each sister imputed to herself the fault that there was aught like
estrangement existing between them; and when, having finished their
devotions, and betaken themselves to their common couch, they folded
each other in their arms, and exchanged a sisterly kiss, and a sisterly
good-night, they seemed mutually to ask pardon, and to exchange
forgiveness, although neither said a word of offence, either offered or
received; and both were soon plunged in that light and yet profound
repose, which is only enjoyed when sleep sinks down on the eyes of youth
and innocence.</p>
<p>On the night to which the story relates, both sisters were visited by
dreams, which, though varied by the moods and habits of the sleepers,
bore yet a strange general resemblance to each other.</p>
<p>Minna dreamed that she was in one of the most lonely recesses of the
beach, called Swartaster, where the incessant operation of the waves,
indenting a calcarious rock, has formed a deep <i>halier</i>, which, in the
language of the island, means a subterranean cavern, into which the tide
ebbs and flows. Many of these run to an extraordinary and unascertained
depth under ground, and are the secure retreat of cormorants and seals,
which it is neither easy nor safe to pursue to their extreme recesses.
Amongst these, this halier of Swartaster was accounted peculiarly
inaccessible, and shunned both by fowlers and by seamen, on account of
sharp angles and turnings in the cave itself, as well as the sunken
rocks which rendered it very dangerous for skiffs or boats to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> advance
far into it, especially if there was the usual swell of an island tide.
From the dark-browed mouth of this cavern, it seemed to Minna, in her
dream, that she beheld a mermaid issue, not in the classical dress of a
Nereid, as in Claud Halcro’s mask of the preceding evening, but with
comb and glass in hand, according to popular belief, and lashing the
waves with that long scaly train, which, in the traditions of the
country, forms so frightful a contrast with the fair face, long tresses,
and displayed bosom, of a human and earthly female, of surpassing
beauty. She seemed to beckon to Minna, while her wild notes rang sadly
in her ear, and denounced, in prophetic sounds, calamity and woe.</p>
<p>The vision of Brenda was of a different description, yet equally
melancholy. She sat, as she thought, in her favourite bower, surrounded
by her father and a party of his most beloved friends, amongst whom
Mordaunt Mertoun was not forgotten. She was required to sing; and she
strove to entertain them with a lively ditty, in which she was accounted
eminently successful, and which she sung with such simple, yet natural
humour, as seldom failed to produce shouts of laughter and applause,
while all who could, or who could not sing, were irresistibly compelled
to lend their voices to the chorus. But, on this occasion, it seemed as
if her own voice refused all its usual duty, and as if, while she felt
herself unable to express the words of the well-known air, it assumed,
in her own despite, the deep tones and wild and melancholy notes of
Norna of Fitful-head, for the purpose of chanting some wild Runic rhyme,
resembling those sung by the heathen priests of old, when the victim
(too often human) was bound to the fatal altar of Odin or of Thor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>At length the two sisters at once started from sleep, and, uttering a
low scream of fear, clasped themselves in each other’s arms. For their
fancy had not altogether played them false; the sounds, which had
suggested their dreams, were real, and sung within their apartment. They
knew the voice well, indeed, and yet, knowing to whom it belonged, their
surprise and fear were scarce the less, when they saw the well-known
Norna of Fitful-head, seated by the chimney of the apartment, which,
during the summer season, contained an iron lamp well trimmed, and, in
winter, a fire of wood or of turf.</p>
<p>She was wrapped in her long and ample garment of wadmaal, and moved her
body slowly to and fro over the pale flame of the lamp, as she sung
lines to the following purport, in a slow, sad, and almost an unearthly
accent:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“For leagues along the watery way,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through gulf and stream my course has been;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The billows know my Runic lay,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And smooth their crests to silent green.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“The billows know my Runic lay,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The gulf grows smooth, the stream is still;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But human hearts, more wild than they,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Know but the rule of wayward will.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“One hour is mine, in all the year,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To tell my woes,—and one alone;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When gleams this magic lamp, ’tis here,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When dies the mystic light, ’tis gone.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Daughters of northern Magnus, hail!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lamp is lit, the flame is clear,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To you I come to tell my tale,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Awake, arise, my tale to hear!”</span><br>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>
<p>Norna was well known to the daughters of Troil, but it was not without
emotion, although varied by their respective dispositions, that they
beheld her so unexpectedly, and at such an hour. Their opinions with
respect to the supernatural attributes to which she pretended, were
extremely different.</p>
<p>Minna, with an unusual intensity of imagination, although superior in
talent to her sister, was more apt to listen to, and delight in, every
tale of wonder, and was at all times more willing to admit impressions
which gave her fancy scope and exercise, without minutely examining
their reality. Brenda, on the other hand, had, in her gaiety, a slight
propensity to satire, and was often tempted to laugh at the very
circumstances upon which Minna founded her imaginative dreams; and, like
all who love the ludicrous, she did not readily suffer herself to be
imposed upon, or overawed, by pompous pretensions of any kind whatever.
But, as her nerves were weaker and more irritable than those of her
sister, she often paid involuntary homage, by her fears, to ideas which
her reason disowned; and hence, Claud Halcro used to say, in reference
to many of the traditionary superstitions around Burgh-Westra, that
Minna believed them without trembling, and that Brenda trembled without
believing them. In our own more enlightened days, there are few whose
undoubting mind and native courage have not felt Minna’s high wrought
tone of enthusiasm; and perhaps still fewer, who have not, at one time
or other, felt, like Brenda, their nerves confess the influence of
terrors which their reason disowned and despised.</p>
<p>Under the power of such different feelings, Minna, when the first moment
of surprise was over, pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>pared to spring from her bed, and go to greet
Norna, who, she doubted not, had come on some errand fraught with fate;
while Brenda, who only beheld in her a woman partially deranged in her
understanding, and who yet, from the extravagance of her claims,
regarded her as an undefined object of awe, or rather terror, detained
her sister by an eager and terrified grasp, while she whispered in her
ear an anxious entreaty that she would call for assistance. But the soul
of Minna was too highly wrought up by the crisis at which her fate
seemed to have arrived, to permit her to follow the dictates of her
sister’s fears; and, extricating herself from Brenda’s hold, she hastily
threw on a loose nightgown, and, stepping boldly across the apartment,
while her heart throbbed rather with high excitement than with fear, she
thus addressed her singular visitor:</p>
<p>“Norna, if your mission regards us, as your words seem to express, there
is one of us, at least, who will receive its import with reverence, but
without fear.”</p>
<p>“Norna, dear Norna,” said the tremulous voice of Brenda,—who, feeling
no safety in the bed after Minna quitted it, had followed her, as
fugitives crowd into the rear of an advancing army, because they dare
not remain behind, and who now stood half concealed by her sister, and
holding fast by the skirts of her gown,—“Norna, dear Norna,” said she,
“whatever you are to say, let it be to-morrow. I will call Euphane Fea,
the housekeeper, and she will find you a bed for the night.”</p>
<p>“No bed for me!” said their nocturnal visitor; “no closing of the eyes
for me! They have watched as shelf and stack appeared and disappeared
betwixt Burgh-Westra and Orkney—they have seen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> Man of Hoy sink
into the sea, and the Peak of Hengcliff arise from it, and yet they have
not tasted of slumber; nor must they slumber now till my task is ended.
Sit down, then, Minna, and thou, silly trembler, sit down, while I trim
my lamp—Don your clothes, for the tale is long, and ere ’tis done, ye
will shiver with worse than cold.”</p>
<p>“For Heaven’s sake, then, put it off till daylight, dear Norna!” said
Brenda; “the dawn cannot be far distant; and if you are to tell us of
any thing frightful, let it be by daylight, and not by the dim glimmer
of that blue lamp!”</p>
<p>“Patience, fool!” said their uninvited guest. “Not by daylight should
Norna tell a tale that might blot the sun out of heaven, and blight the
hopes of the hundred boats that will leave this shore ere noon, to
commence their deep-sea fishing,—ay, and of the hundred families that
will await their return. The demon, whom the sounds will not fail to
awaken, must shake his dark wings over a shipless and a boatless sea, as
he rushes from his mountain to drink the accents of horror he loves so
well to listen to.”</p>
<p>“Have pity on Brenda’s fears, good Norna,” said the elder sister, “and
at least postpone this frightful communication to another place and
hour.”</p>
<p>“Maiden, no!” replied Norna, sternly; “it must be told while that lamp
yet burns. Mine is no daylight tale—by that lamp it must be told, which
is framed out of the gibbet-irons of the cruel Lord of Wodensvoe, who
murdered his brother; and has for its nourishment—but be that
nameless—enough that its food never came either from the fish or from
the fruit!—See, it waxes dim and dimmer, nor must my tale last longer
than its flame endureth. Sit ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> down there, while I sit here opposite
to you, and place the lamp betwixt us; for within the sphere of its
light the demon dares not venture.”</p>
<p>The sisters obeyed, Minna casting a slow awestruck, yet determined look
all around, as if to see the Being, who, according to the doubtful words
of Norna, hovered in their neighbourhood; while Brenda’s fears were
mingled with some share both of anger and of impatience. Norna paid no
attention to either, but began her story in the following words:—</p>
<p>“Ye know, my daughters, that your blood is allied to mine, but in what
degree ye know not; for there was early hostility betwixt your grandsire
and him who had the misfortune to call me daughter.—Let me term him by
his Christian name of Erland, for that which marks our relation I dare
not bestow. Your grandsire Olave, was the brother of Erland. But when
the wide Udal possessions of their father Rolfe Troil, the most rich and
well estated of any who descended from the old Norse stock, were divided
betwixt the brothers, the Fowd gave to Erland his father’s lands in
Orkney, and reserved for Olave those of Hialtland. Discord arose between
the brethren; for Erland held that he was wronged; and when the
Lawting,<a id="FNanchor_47_60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_60">[47]</a> with the Raddmen and Lawright-men, confirmed the
division, he went in wrath to Orkney, cursing Hialtland and its
inhabitants—cursing his brother and his blood.</p>
<p>“But the love of the rock and of the mountain still wrought on Erland’s
mind, and he fixed his dwelling not on the soft hills of Ophir, or the
green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> plains of Gramesey, but in the wild and mountainous Isle of Hoy,
whose summit rises to the sky like the cliffs of Foulah and of
Feroe.<a id="FNanchor_48_61"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_61">[48]</a> He knew,—that unhappy Erland,—whatever of legendary lore
Scald and Bard had left behind them; and to teach me that knowledge,
which was to cost us both so dear, was the chief occupation of his old
age. I learned to visit each lonely barrow—each lofty cairn—to tell
its appropriate tale, and to soothe with rhymes in his praise the spirit
of the stern warrior who dwelt within. I knew where the sacrifices were
made of yore to Thor and to Odin, on what stones the blood of the
victims flowed—where stood the dark-browed priest—where the crested
chiefs, who consulted the will of the idol—where the more distant crowd
of inferior worshippers, who looked on in awe or in terror. The places
most shunned by the timid peasants had no terrors for me; I dared walk
in the fairy circle, and sleep by the magic spring.</p>
<p>“But, for my misfortune, I was chiefly fond to linger about the Dwarfie
Stone, as it is called, a relic of antiquity, which strangers look on
with curiosity, and the natives with awe. It is a huge fragment of rock,
which lies in a broken and rude valley, full of stones and precipices,
in the recesses of the Ward-hill of Hoy. The inside of the rock has two
couches, hewn by no earthly hand, and having a small passage between
them. The doorway is now open to the weather; but beside it lies a
large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> stone, which, adapted to grooves still visible in the entrance,
once had served to open and to close this extraordinary dwelling, which
Trolld, a dwarf famous in the northern Sagas, is said to have framed for
his own favourite residence. The lonely shepherd avoids the place; for
at sunrise, high noon, or sunset, the misshapen form of the necromantic
owner may sometimes still be seen sitting by the Dwarfie Stone.<a id="FNanchor_49_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_62">[49]</a> I
feared not the apparition, for, Minna, my heart was as bold, and my hand
was as innocent, as yours. In my childish courage, I was even but too
presumptuous, and the thirst after things unattainable led me, like our
primitive mother, to desire increase of knowledge, even by prohibited
means. I longed to possess the power of the Voluspæ and divining women
of our ancient race; to wield, like them, command over the elements; and
to summon the ghosts of deceased heroes from their caverns, that they
might recite their daring deeds, and impart to me their hidden
treasures. Often when watching by the Dwarfie Stone, with mine eyes
fixed on the Ward-hill, which rises above that gloomy valley, I have
distinguished, among the dark rocks, that wonderful carbuncle,<a id="FNanchor_50_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_63">[50]</a><a id="FNanchor_P_64"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_P_64">(<i>p</i>)</a>
which gleams ruddy as a furnace to them who view it from beneath, but
has ever become invisible to him whose daring foot has scaled the
precipices from which it darts its splendour. My vain and youthful bosom
burned to investigate these and an hundred other mysteries, which the
Sagas that I perused, or learned from Erland, rather indicated than
explained; and in my daring mood, I called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> on the Lord of the Dwarfie
Stone to aid me in attaining knowledge inaccessible to mere mortals.”</p>
<p>“And the evil spirit heard your summons?” said Minna, her blood curdling
as she listened.</p>
<p>“Hush,” said Norna, lowering her voice, “vex him not with reproach—he
is with us—he hears us even now.”</p>
<p>Brenda started from her seat.—“I will to Euphane Fea’s chamber,” she
said, “and leave you, Minna and Norna, to finish your stories of
hobgoblins and of dwarfs at your own leisure; I care not for them at any
time, but I will not endure them at midnight, and by this pale
lamplight.”</p>
<p>She was accordingly in the act of leaving the room, when her sister
detained her.</p>
<p>“Is this the courage,” she said, “of her, that disbelieves whatever the
history of our fathers tells us of supernatural prodigy? What Norna has
to tell concerns the fate, perhaps, of our father and his house;—if I
can listen to it, trusting that God and my innocence will protect me
from all that is malignant, you, Brenda, who believe not in such
influence, have surely no cause to tremble. Credit me, that for the
guiltless there is no fear.”</p>
<p>“There may be no danger,” said Brenda, unable to suppress her natural
turn for humour, “but, as the old jest book says, there is much fear.
However, Minna, I will stay with you;—the rather,” she added, in a
whisper, “that I am loath to leave you alone with this frightful woman,
and that I have a dark staircase and long passage betwixt and Euphane
Fea, else I would have her here ere I were five minutes older.”</p>
<p>“Call no one hither, maiden, upon peril of thy life,” said Norna, “and
interrupt not my tale again;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> for it cannot and must not be told after
that charmed light has ceased to burn.”</p>
<p>“And I thank heaven,” said Brenda to herself, “that the oil burns low in
the cruize! I am sorely tempted to lend it a puff, but then Norna would
be alone with us in the dark, and that would be worse.”</p>
<p>So saying, she submitted to her fate, and sat down, determined to listen
with all the equanimity which she could command to the remaining part of
Norna’s tale, which went on as follows:—</p>
<p>“It happened on a hot summer day, and just about the hour of noon,”
continued Norna, “as I sat by the Dwarfie Stone, with my eyes fixed on
the Ward-hill, whence the mysterious and ever-burning carbuncle shed its
rays more brightly than usual, and repined in my heart at the restricted
bounds of human knowledge, that at length I could not help exclaiming,
in the words of an ancient Saga,</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">‘Dwellers of the mountain, rise,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trolld the powerful, Haims the wise!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye who taught weak woman’s tongue</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Words that sway the wise and strong,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye who taught weak woman’s hand</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How to wield the magic wand,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wake the gales on Foulah’s steep,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or lull wild Sumburgh’s waves to sleep!—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still are ye yet?—Not yours the power</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye knew in Odin’s mightier hour.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What are ye now but empty names,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Powerful Trolld, sagacious Haims,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That, lightly spoken, lightly heard,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Float on the air like thistle’s beard?’</span><br>
</p>
<p>“I had scarce uttered these words,” proceeded Norna, “ere the sky, which
had been till then unusually clear, grew so suddenly dark around me,
that it seemed more like midnight than noon. A single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> flash of
lightning showed me at once the desolate landscape of heath, morass,
mountain, and precipice, which lay around; a single clap of thunder
wakened all the echoes of the Ward-hill, which continued so long to
repeat the sound, that it seemed some rock, rent by the thunderbolt from
the summit, was rolling over cliff and precipice into the valley.
Immediately after, fell a burst of rain so violent, that I was fain to
shun its pelting, by creeping into the interior of the mysterious stone.</p>
<p>“I seated myself on the larger stone couch, which is cut at the farther
end of the cavity, and, with my eyes fixed on the smaller bed, wearied
myself with conjectures respecting the origin and purpose of my singular
place of refuge. Had it been really the work of that powerful Trolld, to
whom the poetry of the Scalds referred it? Or was it the tomb of some
Scandinavian chief, interred with his arms and his wealth, perhaps also
with his immolated wife, that what he loved best in life might not in
death be divided from him? Or was it the abode of penance, chosen by
some devoted anchorite of later days? Or the idle work of some wandering
mechanic, whom chance, and whim, and leisure, had thrust upon such an
undertaking? I tell you the thoughts that then floated through my brain,
that ye may know that what ensued was not the vision of a prejudiced or
prepossessed imagination, but an apparition, as certain as it was awful.</p>
<p>“Sleep had gradually crept on me, amidst my lucubrations, when I was
startled from my slumbers by a second clap of thunder; and, when I
awoke, I saw, through the dim light which the upper aperture admitted,
the unshapely and indistinct form of Trolld the dwarf, seated opposite
to me on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> lesser couch, which his square and misshapen bulk seemed
absolutely to fill up. I was startled, but not affrighted; for the blood
of the ancient race of Lochlin was warm in my veins. He spoke; and his
words were of Norse, so old, that few, save my father, or I myself,
could have comprehended their import,—such language as was spoken in
these islands ere Olave planted the cross on the ruins of heathenism.
His meaning was dark also and obscure, like that which the Pagan priests
were wont to deliver, in the name of their idols, to the tribes that
assembled at the <i>Helgafels</i>.<a id="FNanchor_51_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_65">[51]</a> This was the import,—</p>

</p>
<p>“I answered him in nearly the same strain; for the spirit of the ancient
Scalds of our race was upon me, and, far from fearing the phantom, with
whom I sat cooped within so narrow a space, I felt the impulse of that
high courage which thrust the ancient Champions and Druidesses upon
contests with the invisible world, when they thought that the earth no

answer him thus:—</p>

<p>“The Demon scowled at me, as if at once incensed and overawed; and then
coiling himself up in a thick and sulphureous vapour, he disappeared
from his place. I did not, till that moment, feel the influence of
fright, but then it seized me. I rushed into the open air, where the
tempest had passed away, and all was pure and serene. After a moment’s
breathless pause, I hasted home, musing by the way on the words of the
phantom, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> I could not, as often happens, recall so distinctly to
memory at the time, as I have been able to do since.</p>
<p>“It may seem strange that such an apparition should, in time, have
glided from my mind, like a vision of the night—but so it was. I
brought myself to believe it the work of fancy—I thought I had lived
too much in solitude, and had given way too much to the feelings
inspired by my favourite studies. I abandoned them for a time, and I
mixed with the youth of my age. I was upon a visit at Kirkwall when I
learned to know your father, whom business had brought thither. He
easily found access to the relation with whom I lived, who was anxious
to compose, if possible, the feud which divided our families. Your
father, maidens, has been rather hardened than changed by years—he had
the same manly form, the same old Norse frankness of manner and of
heart, the same upright courage and honesty of disposition, with more of
the gentle ingenuousness of youth, an eager desire to please, a
willingness to be pleased, and a vivacity of spirits which survives not
our early years. But though he was thus worthy of love, and though
Erland wrote to me, authorizing his attachment, there was another—a
stranger, Minna, a fatal stranger—full of arts unknown to us, and
graces which to the plain manners of your father were unknown. Yes, he
walked, indeed, among us like a being of another and of a superior
race.—Ye look on me as if it were strange that I should have had
attractions for such a lover; but I present nothing that can remind you
that Norna of the Fitful-head was once admired and loved as Ulla
Troil—the change betwixt the animated body and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> the corpse after
disease, is scarce more awful and absolute than I have sustained, while
I yet linger on earth. Look on me, maidens—look on me by this
glimmering light—Can ye believe that these haggard and weather-wasted
features—these eyes, which have been almost converted to stone, by
looking upon sights of terror—these locks, that, mingled with grey, now
stream out, the shattered pennons of a sinking vessel—that these, and
she to whom they belong, could once be the objects of fond
affection?—But the waning lamp sinks fast, and let it sink while I tell
my infamy.—We loved in secret, we met in secret, till I gave the last
proof of fatal and of guilty passion!—And now beam out, thou magic
glimmer—shine out a little space, thou flame so powerful even in thy
feebleness—bid him who hovers near us, keep his dark pinions aloof from
the circle thou dost illuminate—live but a little till the worst be
told, and then sink when thou wilt into darkness, as black as my guilt
and sorrow!”</p>
<p>While she spoke thus, she drew together the remaining nutriment of the
lamp, and trimmed its decaying flame; then again, with a hollow voice,
and in broken sentences, pursued her narrative.</p>
<p>“I must waste little time in words. My love was discovered, but not my
guilt. Erland came to Pomona in anger, and transported me to our
solitary dwelling in Hoy. He commanded me to see my lover no more, and
to receive Magnus, in whom he was willing to forgive the offences of his
father, as my future husband. Alas, I no longer deserved his
attachment—my only wish was to escape from my father’s dwelling, to
conceal my shame in my lover’s arms. Let me do him justice—he was
faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>—too, too faithful—his perfidy would have bereft me of my
senses; but the fatal consequences of his fidelity have done me a
tenfold injury.”</p>
<p>She paused, and then resumed, with the wild tone of insanity, “It has
made me the powerful and the despairing Sovereign of the Seas and
Winds!”</p>
<p>She paused a second time after this wild exclamation, and resumed her
narrative in a more composed manner.</p>
<p>“My lover came in secret to Hoy, to concert measures for my flight, and
I agreed to meet him, that we might fix the time when his vessel should
come into the Sound. I left the house at midnight.”</p>
<p>Here she appeared to gasp with agony, and went on with her tale by
broken and interrupted sentences. “I left the house at midnight—I had
to pass my father’s door, and I perceived it was open—I thought he
watched us; and, that the sound of my steps might not break his
slumbers, I closed the fatal door—a light and trivial action—but, God
in Heaven! what were the consequences!—At morn, the room was full of
suffocating vapour—my father was dead—dead through my act—dead
through my disobedience—dead through my infamy! All that follows is
mist and darkness—a choking, suffocating, stifling mist envelopes all
that I said and did, all that was said and done, until I became assured
that my doom was accomplished, and walked forth the calm and terrible
being you now behold me—the Queen of the Elements—the sharer in the
power of those beings to whom man and his passions give such sport as
the tortures of the dog-fish afford the fisherman, when he pierces his
eyes with thorns, and turns him once more into his native element, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
traverse the waves in blindness and agony.<a id="FNanchor_60_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60_74">[60]</a> No, maidens, she whom you
see before you is impassive to the follies of which your minds are the
sport. I am she that have made the offering—I am she that bereaved the
giver of the gift of life which he gave me—the dark saying has been
interpreted by my deed, and I am taken from humanity, to be something
pre-eminently powerful, pre-eminently wretched!”</p>
<p>As she spoke thus, the light, which had been long quivering, leaped high
for an instant, and seemed about to expire, when Norna, interrupting
herself, said hastily, “No more now—he comes—he comes—Enough that ye
know me, and the right I have to advise and command you.—Approach now,
proud Spirit! if thou wilt.”</p>
<p>So saying, she extinguished the lamp, and passed out of the apartment
with her usual loftiness of step, as Minna could observe from its
measured cadence.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is all the counsel that we two have shared—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we have chid the hasty-footed time</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>Midsummer-Night’s Dream.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The attention of Minna was powerfully arrested by this tale of terror,
which accorded with and explained many broken hints respecting Norna,
which she had heard from her father and other near relations, and she
was for a time so lost in surprise, not unmingled with horror, that she
did not even attempt to speak to her sister Brenda. When, at length, she
called her by her name, she received no answer, and, on touching her
hand, she found it cold as ice. Alarmed to the uttermost, she threw open
the lattice and the window-shutters, and admitted at once the free air
and the pale glimmer of the hyperborean summer night. She then became
sensible that her sister was in a swoon. All thoughts concerning Norna,
her frightful tale, and her mysterious connexion with the invisible
world, at once vanished from Minna’s thoughts, and she hastily ran to
the apartment of the old housekeeper, to summon her aid, without
reflecting for a moment what sights she might encounter in the long dark
passages which she had to traverse.</p>
<p>The old woman hastened to Brenda’s assistance, and instantly applied
such remedies as her experi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>ence suggested; but the poor girl’s nervous
system had been so much agitated by the horrible tale she had just
heard, that, when recovered from her swoon, her utmost endeavours to
compose her mind could not prevent her falling into a hysterical fit of
some duration. This also was subdued by the experience of old Euphane
Fea, who was well versed in all the simple pharmacy used by the natives
of Zetland, and who, after administering a composing draught, distilled
from simples and wild flowers, at length saw her patient resigned to
sleep. Minna stretched herself beside her sister, kissed her cheek, and
courted slumber in her turn; but the more she invoked it, the farther it
seemed to fly from her eyelids; and if at times she was disposed to sink
into repose, the voice of the involuntary parricide seemed again to
sound in her ears, and startled her into consciousness.</p>
<p>The early morning hour at which they were accustomed to rise, found the
state of the sisters different from what might have been expected. A
sound sleep had restored the spirit of Brenda’s lightsome eye, and the
rose on her laughing cheek; the transient indisposition of the preceding
night having left as little trouble on her look, as the fantastic
terrors of Norna’s tale had been able to impress on her imagination. The
looks of Minna, on the contrary, were melancholy, downcast, and
apparently exhausted by watching and anxiety. They said at first little
to each other, as if afraid of touching a subject so fraught with
emotion as the scene of the preceding night. It was not until they had
performed together their devotions, as usual, that Brenda, while lacing
Minna’s boddice, (for they rendered the services of the toilet to each
other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> reciprocally,) became aware of the paleness of her sister’s
looks; and having ascertained, by a glance at the mirror, that her own
did not wear the same dejection, she kissed Minna’s cheek, and said
affectionately, “Claud Halcro was right, my dearest sister, when his
poetical folly gave us these names of Night and Day.”</p>
<p>“And wherefore should you say so now?” said Minna.</p>
<p>“Because we each are bravest in the season that we take our name from: I
was frightened wellnigh to death, by hearing those things last night,
which you endured with courageous firmness; and now, when it is broad
light, I can think of them with composure, while you look as pale as a
spirit who is surprised by sunrise.”</p>
<p>“You are lucky, Brenda,” said her sister, gravely, “who can so soon
forget such a tale of wonder and horror.”</p>
<p>“The horror,” said Brenda, “is never to be forgotten, unless one could
hope that the unfortunate woman’s excited imagination, which shows
itself so active in conjuring up apparitions, may have fixed on her an
imaginary crime.”</p>
<p>“You believe nothing, then,” said Minna, “of her interview at the
Dwarfie Stone, that wondrous place, of which so many tales are told, and
which, for so many centuries, has been reverenced as the work of a
demon, and as his abode?”</p>
<p>“I believe,” said Brenda, “that our unhappy relative is no
impostor,—and therefore I believe that she was at the Dwarfie Stone
during a thunderstorm, that she sought shelter in it, and that, during a
swoon, or during sleep perhaps, some dream visited her, concerned with
the popular traditions with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> she was so conversant; but I cannot
easily believe more.”</p>
<p>“And yet the event,” said Minna, “corresponded to the dark intimations
of the vision.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” said Brenda, “I rather think the dream would never have
been put into shape, or perhaps remembered at all, but for the event.
She told us herself she had nearly forgot the vision, till after her
father’s dreadful death,—and who shall warrant how much of what she
then supposed herself to remember was not the creation of her own fancy,
disordered as it naturally was by the horrid accident? Had she really
seen and conversed with a necromantic dwarf, she was likely to remember
the conversation long enough—at least I am sure I should.”</p>
<p>“Brenda,” replied Minna, “you have heard the good minister of the
Cross-Kirk say, that human wisdom was worse than folly, when it was
applied to mysteries beyond its comprehension; and that, if we believed
no more than we could understand, we should resist the evidence of our
senses, which presented us, at every turn, circumstances as certain as
they were unintelligible.”</p>
<p>“You are too learned yourself, sister,” answered Brenda, “to need the
assistance of the good minister of Cross-Kirk; but I think his doctrine
only related to the mysteries of our religion, which it is our duty to
receive without investigation or doubt—but in things occurring in
common life, as God has bestowed reason upon us, we cannot act wrong in
employing it. But you, my dear Minna, have a warmer fancy than mine, and
are willing to receive all those wonderful stories for truth, because
you love to think of sorcerers, and dwarfs, and water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>-spirits, and
would like much to have a little trow, or fairy, as the Scotch call
them, with a green coat, and a pair of wings as brilliant as the hues of
the starling’s neck, specially to attend on you.”</p>
<p>“It would spare you at least the trouble of lacing my boddice,” said
Minna, “and of lacing it wrong, too; for in the heat of your argument
you have missed two eyelet-holes.”</p>
<p>“That error shall be presently mended,” said Brenda; “and then, as one
of our friends might say, I will haul tight and belay—but you draw your
breath so deeply, that it will be a difficult matter.”</p>
<p>“I only sighed,” said Minna, in some confusion, “to think how soon you
can trifle with and ridicule the misfortunes of this extraordinary
woman.”</p>
<p>“I do not ridicule them, God knows!” replied Brenda, somewhat angrily;
“it is you, Minna, who turn all I say in truth and kindness, to
something harsh or wicked. I look on Norna as a woman of very
extraordinary abilities, which are very often united with a strong cast
of insanity; and I consider her as better skilled in the signs of the
weather than any woman in Zetland. But that she has any power over the
elements, I no more believe, than I do in the nursery stories of King
Erick, who could make the wind blow from the point he set his cap to.”</p>
<p>Minna, somewhat nettled with the obstinate incredulity of her sister,
replied sharply, “And yet, Brenda, this woman—half-mad woman, and the
veriest impostor—is the person by whom you choose to be advised in the
matter next your own heart at this moment!”</p>
<p>“I do not know what you mean,” said Brenda, colouring deeply, and
shifting to get away from her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> sister. But as she was now undergoing the
ceremony of being laced in her turn, her sister had the means of holding
her fast by the silken string with which she was fastening the boddice,
and, tapping her on the neck, which expressed, by its sudden writhe, and
sudden change to a scarlet hue, as much pettish confusion as she had
desired to provoke, she added, more mildly, “Is it not strange, Brenda,
that, used as we have been by the stranger Mordaunt Mertoun, whose
assurance has brought him uninvited to a house where his presence is so
unacceptable, you should still look or think of him with favour? Surely,
that you do so should be a proof to you, that there are such things as
spells in the country, and that you yourself labour under them. It is
not for nought that Mordaunt wears a chain of elfin gold—look to it,
Brenda, and be wise in time.”</p>
<p>“I have nothing to do with Mordaunt Mertoun,” answered Brenda, hastily,
“nor do I know or care what he or any other young man wears about his
neck. I could see all the gold chains of all the bailies of Edinburgh,
that Lady Glowrowrum speaks so much of, without falling in fancy with
one of the wearers.” And, having thus complied with the female rule of
pleading not guilty in general to such an indictment, she immediately
resumed, in a different tone, “But, to say the truth, Minna, I think
you, and all of you, have judged far too hastily about this young friend
of ours, who has been so long our most intimate companion. Mind,
Mordaunt Mertoun is no more to me than he is to you—who best know how
little difference he made betwixt us; and that, chain or no chain, he
lived with us like a brother with two sisters; and yet you can turn him
off at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> once, because a wandering seaman, of whom we know nothing, and a
peddling jagger, whom we do know to be a thief, a cheat, and a liar,
speak words and carry tales in his disfavour! I do not believe he ever
said he could have his choice of either of us, and only waited to see
which was to have Burgh-Westra and Bredness Voe—I do not believe he
ever spoke such a word, or harboured such a thought, as that of making a
choice between us.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Minna, coldly, “you may have had reason to know that his
choice was already determined.”</p>
<p>“I will not endure this!” said Brenda, giving way to her natural
vivacity, and springing from between her sister’s hands; then turning
round and facing her, while her glowing cheek was rivalled in the
deepness of its crimson, by as much of her neck and bosom as the upper
part of the half-laced boddice permitted to be visible,—“Even from you,
Minna,” she said, “I will not endure this! You know that all my life I
have spoken the truth, and that I love the truth; and I tell you, that
Mordaunt Mertoun never in his life made distinction betwixt you and me,
until”——</p>
<p>Here some feeling of consciousness stopped her short, and her sister
replied, with a smile, “Until <i>when</i>, Brenda? Methinks, your love of
truth seems choked with the sentence you were bringing out.”</p>
<p>“Until you ceased to do him the justice he deserves,” said Brenda,
firmly, “since I must speak out. I have little doubt that he will not
long throw away his friendship on you, who hold it so lightly.”</p>
<p>“Be it so,” said Minna; “you are secure from my rivalry, either in his
friendship or love. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> bethink you better, Brenda—this is no scandal
of Cleveland’s—Cleveland is incapable of slander—no falsehood of Bryce
Snailsfoot—not one of our friends or acquaintance but says it has been
the common talk of the island, that the daughters of Magnus Troil were
patiently awaiting the choice of the nameless and birthless stranger,
Mordaunt Mertoun. Is it fitting that this should be said of us, the
descendants of a Norwegian Jarl, and the daughters of the first Udaller
in Zetland? or, would it be modest or maidenly to submit to it
unresented, were we the meanest lasses that ever lifted a milk-pail?”</p>
<p>“The tongues of fools are no reproach,” replied Brenda, warmly; “I will
never quit my own thoughts of an innocent friend for the gossip of the
island, which can put the worst meaning on the most innocent actions.”</p>
<p>“Hear but what our friends say,” repeated Minna; “hear but the Lady
Glowrowrum; hear but Maddie and Clara Groatsettar.”</p>
<p>“If I were to hear Lady Glowrowrum,” said Brenda, steadily, “I should
listen to the worst tongue in Zetland; and as for Maddie and Clara
Groatsettar, they were both blithe enough to get Mordaunt to sit betwixt
them at dinner the day before yesterday, as you might have observed
yourself, but that your ear was better engaged.”</p>
<p>“Your eyes, at least, have been but indifferently engaged, Brenda,”
retorted the elder sister, “since they were fixed on a young man, whom
all the world but yourself believes to have talked of us with the most
insolent presumption; and even if he be innocently charged, Lady
Glowrowrum says it is unmaidenly and bold of you even to look in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
direction where he sits, knowing it must confirm such reports.”</p>
<p>“I will look which way I please,” said Brenda, growing still warmer;
“Lady Glowrowrum shall neither rule my thoughts, nor my words, nor my
eyes. I hold Mordaunt Mertoun to be innocent,—I will look at him as
such,—I will speak of him as such; and if I did not speak to him also,
and behave to him as usual, it is in obedience to my father, and not for
what Lady Glowrowrum, and all her nieces, had she twenty instead of two,
could think, wink, nod, or tattle, about the matter that concerns them
not.”</p>
<p>“Alas! Brenda,” answered Minna, with calmness, “this vivacity is more
than is required for the defence of the character of a mere
friend!—Beware—He who ruined Norna’s peace for ever, was a stranger,
admitted to her affections against the will of her family.”</p>
<p>“He was a stranger,” replied Brenda, with emphasis, “not only in birth,
but in manners. She had not been bred up with him from her youth,—she
had not known the gentleness, the frankness, of his disposition, by an
intimacy of many years. He was indeed a stranger, in character, temper,
birth, manners, and morals,—some wandering adventurer, perhaps, whom
chance or tempest had thrown upon the islands, and who knew how to mask
a false heart with a frank brow. My good sister, take home your own
warning. There are other strangers at Burgh-Westra besides this poor
Mordaunt Mertoun.”</p>
<p>Minna seemed for a moment overwhelmed with the rapidity with which her
sister retorted her suspicion and her caution. But her natural
loftiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> of disposition enabled her to reply with assumed composure.</p>
<p>“Were I to treat you, Brenda, with the want of confidence you show
towards me, I might reply that Cleveland is no more to me than Mordaunt
was; or than young Swartaster, or Lawrence Ericson, or any other
favourite guest of my father’s, now is. But I scorn to deceive you, or
to disguise my thoughts.—I love Clement Cleveland.”</p>
<p>“Do not say so, my dearest sister,” said Brenda, abandoning at once the
air of acrimony with which the conversation had been latterly conducted,
and throwing her arms round her sister’s neck, with looks, and with a
tone, of the most earnest affection,—“do not say so, I implore you! I
will renounce Mordaunt Mertoun,—I will swear never to speak to him
again; but do not repeat that you love this Cleveland!”</p>
<p>“And why should I not repeat,” said Minna, disengaging herself gently
from her sister’s grasp, “a sentiment in which I glory? The boldness,
the strength and energy, of his character, to which command is natural,
and fear unknown,—these very properties, which alarm you for my
happiness, are the qualities which ensure it. Remember, Brenda, that
when your foot loved the calm smooth sea-beach of the summer sea, mine
ever delighted in the summit of the precipice, when the waves are in
fury.”</p>
<p>“And it is even that which I dread,” said Brenda; “it is even that
adventurous disposition which now is urging you to the brink of a
precipice more dangerous than ever was washed by a spring-tide. This
man,—do not frown, I will say no slander of him,—but is he not, even
in your own partial judgment, stern and overbearing? accustomed, as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
say, to command; but, for that very reason, commanding where he has no
right to do so, and leading whom it would most become him to follow?
rushing on danger, rather for its own sake, than for any other object?
And can you think of being yoked with a spirit so unsettled and stormy,
whose life has hitherto been led in scenes of death and peril, and who,
even while sitting by your side, cannot disguise his impatience again to
engage in them? A lover, methinks, should love his mistress better than
his own life; but yours, my dear Minna, loves her less than the pleasure
of inflicting death on others.”</p>
<p>“And it is even for that I love him,” said Minna. “I am a daughter of
the old dames of Norway, who could send their lovers to battle with a
smile, and slay them, with their own hands, if they returned with
dishonour. My lover must scorn the mockeries by which our degraded race
strive for distinction, or must practise them only in sport, and in
earnest of nobler dangers. No whale-striking, bird-nesting favourite for
me; my lover must be a Sea-king, or what else modern times may give that
draws near to that lofty character.”</p>
<p>“Alas, my sister!” said Brenda, “it is now that I must in earnest begin
to believe the force of spells and of charms. You remember the Spanish
story which you took from me long since, because I said, in your
admiration of the chivalry of the olden times of Scandinavia, you
rivalled the extravagance of the hero.—Ah, Minna, your colour shows
that your conscience checks you, and reminds you of the book I mean;—is
it more wise, think you, to mistake a windmill for a giant, or the
commander of a paltry corsair for a Kiempe, or a Vi-king?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Minna did indeed colour with anger at this insinuation, of which,
perhaps, she felt in some degree the truth.</p>
<p>“You have a right,” she said, “to insult me, because you are possessed
of my secret.”</p>
<p>Brenda’s soft heart could not resist this charge of unkindness; she
adjured her sister to pardon her, and the natural gentleness of Minna’s
feelings could not resist her entreaties.</p>
<p>“We are unhappy,” she said, as she dried her sister’s tears, “that we
cannot see with the same eyes—let us not make each other more so by
mutual insult and unkindness. You have my secret—it will not, perhaps,
long be one, for my father shall have the confidence to which he is
entitled, so soon as certain circumstances will permit me to offer it.
Meantime, I repeat, you have my secret, and I more than suspect that I
have yours in exchange, though you refuse to own it.”</p>
<p>“How, Minna!” said Brenda; “would you have me acknowledge for any one
such feelings as you allude to, ere he has said the least word that
could justify such a confession?”</p>
<p>“Surely not; but a hidden fire may be distinguished by heat as well as
flame.”</p>
<p>“You understand these signs, Minna,” said Brenda, hanging down her head,
and in vain endeavouring to suppress the temptation to repartee which
her sister’s remark offered; “but I can only say, that, if ever I love
at all, it shall not be until I have been asked to do so once or twice
at least, which has not yet chanced to me. But do not let us renew our
quarrel, and rather let us think why Norna should have told us that
horrible tale, and to what she expects it should lead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“It must have been as a caution,” replied Minna—“a caution which our
situation, and, I will not deny it, which mine in particular, might seem
to her to call for;—but I am alike strong in my own innocence, and in
the honour of Cleveland.”</p>
<p>Brenda would fain have replied, that she did not confide so absolutely
in the latter security as in the first; but she was prudent, and,
forbearing to awaken the former painful discussion, only replied, “It is
strange that Norna should have said nothing more of her lover. Surely he
could not desert her in the extremity of misery to which he had reduced
her?”</p>
<p>“There may be agonies of distress,” said Minna, after a pause, “in which
the mind is so much jarred, that it ceases to be responsive even to the
feelings which have most engrossed it;—her sorrow for her lover may
have been swallowed up in horror and despair.”</p>
<p>“Or he might have fled from the islands, in fear of our father’s
vengeance,” replied Brenda.</p>
<p>“If for fear, or faintness of heart,” said Minna, looking upwards, “he
was capable of flying from the ruin which he had occasioned, I trust he
has long ere this sustained the punishment which Heaven reserves for the
most base and dastardly of traitors and of cowards.—Come, sister, we
are ere this expected at the breakfast board.”</p>
<p>And they went thither, arm in arm, with much more of confidence than had
lately subsisted between them; the little quarrel which had taken place
having served the purpose of a <i>bourasque</i>, or sudden squall, which
dispels mists and vapours, and leaves fair weather behind it.</p>
<p>On their way to the breakfast apartment, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> agreed that it was
unnecessary, and might be imprudent, to communicate to their father the
circumstance of the nocturnal visit, or to let him observe that they now
knew more than formerly of the melancholy history of Norna.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR’S NOTES.</h2>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_I"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_20" class="pginternal">Note I.</a>, p. 22.—<span class="smcap">Norse Fragments.</span></p>
<p>Near the conclusion of Chapter II, it is noticed that the old Norwegian
sagas were preserved and often repeated by the fishermen of Orkney and
Zetland, while that language was not yet quite forgotten. Mr. Baikie of
Tankerness, a most respectable inhabitant of Kirkwall, and an Orkney
proprietor, assured me of the following curious fact.</p>
<p>A clergyman, who was not long deceased, remembered well when some
remnants of the Norse were still spoken in the island called North
Ronaldshaw. When Gray’s Ode, entitled the “Fatal Sisters,” was first
published, or at least first reached that remote island, the reverend
gentleman had the well-judged curiosity to read it to some of the old
persons of the isle, as a poem which regarded the history of their own
country. They listened with great attention to the preliminary
stanzas:—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Now the storm begins to lour,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Haste the loom of hell prepare,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Iron sleet of arrowry shower</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hurtles in the darken’d air.”</span><br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">But when they had heard a verse or two more, they interrupted the
reader, telling him they knew the song well in the Norse language, and
had often sung it to him when he asked them for an old song. They called
it the Magicians, or the Enchantresses. It would have been singular news
to the elegant translator, when executing his version from the text of
Bartholine, to have learned that the Norse original was still preserved
by tradition in a remote corner of the British dominions. The
circumstances will probably justify what is said in the text concerning
the traditions of the inhabitants of those remote isles, at the
beginning of the eighteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<p>Even yet, though the Norse language is entirely disused, except in so
far as particular words and phrases are still retained, these fishers of
the Ultima Thule are a generation much attached to these ancient
legends. Of this the author learned a singular instance.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, a missionary clergyman had taken the resolution
of traversing those wild islands, where he supposed there might be a
lack of religious instruction, which he believed himself capable of
supplying. After being some days at sea in an open boat, he arrived at
North Ronaldshaw, where his appearance excited great speculation. He was
a very little man, dark-complexioned, and from the fatigue he had
sustained in removing from one island to another, appeared before them
ill-dressed and unshaved; so that the inhabitants set him down as one of
the Ancient Picts, or, as they call them with the usual strong guttural,
Peghts. How they might have received the poor preacher in this
character, was at least dubious; and the schoolmaster of the parish, who
had given quarters to the fatigued traveller, set off to consult with
Mr. S——, the able and ingenious engineer of the Scottish Light-House
Service, who chanced to be on the island. As his skill and knowledge
were in the highest repute, it was conceived that Mr. S—— could decide
at once whether the stranger was a Peght, or ought to be treated as
such. Mr. S—— was so good-natured as to attend the summons, with the
view of rendering the preacher some service. The poor missionary, who
had watched for three nights, was now fast asleep, little dreaming what
odious suspicions were current respecting him. The inhabitants were
assembled round the door. Mr. S——, understanding the traveller’s
condition, declined disturbing him, upon which the islanders produced a
pair of very little uncouth-looking boots, with prodigiously thick
soles, and appealed to him whether it was possible such articles of
raiment could belong to any one but a Peght. Mr. S——, finding the
prejudices of the natives so strong, was induced to enter the sleeping
apartment of the traveller, and was surprised to recognise in the
supposed Peght a person whom he had known in his worldly profession of
an Edinburgh shopkeeper, before he had assumed his present vocation. Of
course he was enabled to refute all suspicions of Peghtism.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_II"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_21" class="pginternal">Note II.</a>, p. 23.—<span class="smcap">Monsters of the Northern Seas.</span></p>
<p>I have said, in the text, that the wondrous tales told by Pontoppidan,
the Archbishop of Upsal, still find believers in the Northern
Archipelago. It is in vain they are cancelled even in the later editions
of Guthrie’s Grammar, of which instructive work they used to form the
chapter far most attractive to juvenile readers. But the same causes
which probably gave birth to the legends concerning mermaids,
sea-snakes, krakens, and other marvellous inhabitants of the Northern
Ocean, are still afloat in those climates where they took their rise.
They had their origin probably from the eagerness of curiosity
manifested by our elegant poetess, Mrs. Hemans:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“What hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou ever-sounding and mysterious Sea?”</span><br>
</p>
<p>The additional mystic gloom which rests on these northern billows for
half the year, joined to the imperfect glance obtained of occasional
objects, encourage the timid or the fanciful to give way to imagination,
and frequently to shape out a distinct story from some object half seen
and imperfectly examined. Thus, some years since, a large object was
observed in the beautiful Bay of Scalloway in Zetland, so much in vulgar
opinion resembling the kraken, that though it might be distinguished for
several days, if the exchange of darkness to twilight can be termed so,
yet the hardy boatmen shuddered to approach it, for fear of being drawn
down by the suction supposed to attend its sinking. It was probably the
hull of some vessel which had foundered at sea.</p>
<p>The belief in mermaids, so fanciful and pleasing in itself, is ever and
anon refreshed by a strange tale from the remote shores of some solitary
islet.</p>
<p>The author heard a mariner of some reputation in his class vouch for
having seen the celebrated sea-serpent. It appeared, so far as could be
guessed, to be about a hundred feet long, with the wild mane and fiery
eyes which old writers ascribe to the monster; but it is not unlikely
the spectator might, in the doubtful light, be deceived by the
appearance of a good Norway log floating on the waves. I have only to
add, that the remains of an animal, supposed to belong to this latter
species, were driven on shore in the Zetland Isles, within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
recollection of man. Part of the bones were sent to London, and
pronounced by Sir Joseph Banks to be those of a basking shark; yet it
would seem that an animal so well known, ought to have been immediately
distinguished by the northern fishermen.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_III"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_36" class="pginternal">Note III.</a>, p. 104.—<span class="smcap">Sale of Winds.</span></p>
<p>The King of Sweden, the same Eric quoted by Mordaunt, “was,” says Olaus
Magnus, “in his time held second to none in the magical art; and he was
so familiar with the evil spirits whom he worshipped, that what way
soever he turned his cap, the wind would presently blow that way. For
this he was called Windycap.” <i>Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus.
Romæ, 1555.</i> It is well known that the Laplanders derive a profitable
trade in selling <i>winds</i>, but it is perhaps less notorious, that within
these few years such a commodity might be purchased on British ground,
where it was likely to be in great request. At the village of Stromness,
on the Orkney main island, called Pomona, lived, in 1814, an aged dame,
called Bessie Millie, who helped out her subsistence by selling
favourable winds to mariners. He was a venturous master of a vessel who
left the roadstead of Stromness without paying his offering to
propitiate Bessie Millie; her fee was extremely moderate, being exactly
sixpence, for which, as she explained herself, she boiled her kettle and
gave the bark advantage of her prayers, for she disclaimed all unlawful
arts. The wind thus petitioned for was sure, she said, to arrive, though
occasionally the mariners had to wait some time for it. The woman’s
dwelling and appearance were not unbecoming her pretensions; her house,
which was on the brow of the steep hill on which Stromness is founded,
was only accessible by a series of dirty and precipitous lanes, and for
exposure might have been the abode of Eolus himself, in whose
commodities the inhabitant dealt. She herself was, as she told us,
nearly one hundred years old, withered and dried up like a mummy. A
clay-coloured kerchief, folded round her head, corresponded in colour to
her corpse-like complexion. Two light-blue eyes that gleamed with a
lustre like that of insanity, an utterance of astonishing rapidity, a
nose and chin that almost met together, and a ghastly expression of
cunning, gave her the effect of Hecaté. She remembered Gow the pirate,
who had been a native of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> these islands, in which he closed his career,
as mentioned in the preface. Such was Bessie Millie, to whom the
mariners paid a sort of tribute, with a feeling betwixt jest and
earnest.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_IV"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_37" class="pginternal">Note IV.</a>, p. 113.—<span class="smcap">Reluctance to Save a Drowning Man.</span></p>
<p>It is remarkable, that in an archipelago where so many persons must be
necessarily endangered by the waves, so strange and inhuman a maxim
should have ingrafted itself upon the minds of a people otherwise kind,
moral, and hospitable. But all with whom I have spoken agree, that it
was almost general in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was
with difficulty weeded out by the sedulous instructions of the clergy,
and the rigorous injunctions of the proprietors. There is little doubt
it had been originally introduced as an excuse for suffering those who
attempted to escape from the wreck to perish unassisted, so that, there
being no survivor, she might be considered as lawful plunder. A story
was told me, I hope an untrue one, that a vessel having got ashore among
the breakers on one of the remote Zetland islands, five or six men, the
whole or greater part of the unfortunate crew, endeavoured to land by
assistance of a hawser, which they had secured to a rock; the
inhabitants were assembled, and looked on with some uncertainty, till an
old man said, “Sirs, if these men come ashore, the additional mouths
will eat all the meal we have in store for winter; and how are we to get
more?” A young fellow, moved with this argument, struck the rope asunder
with his axe, and all the poor wretches were immersed among the
breakers, and perished.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_V"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_38" class="pginternal">Note V.</a>, p. 121.—<span class="smcap">Mair Wrecks ere Winter.</span></p>
<p>The ancient Zetlander looked upon the sea as the provider of his living,
not only by the plenty produced by the fishings, but by the spoil of
wrecks. Some particular islands have fallen off very considerably in
their rent, since the commissioners of the lighthouses have ordered
lights on the Isle of Sanda and the Pentland Skerries. A gentleman,
familiar with those seas, expressed surprise at seeing the farmer of one
of the isles in a boat with a very old pair of sails. “Had it been His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
will”—said the man, with an affected deference to Providence, very
inconsistent with the sentiment of his speech—“Had it been <i>His</i> will
that light had not been placed yonder, I would have had enough of new
sails last winter.”</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_VI"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_45" class="pginternal">Note VI.</a>, p. 172.—<span class="smcap">Zetland Corn-mills.</span></p>
<p>There is certainly something very extraordinary to a stranger in Zetland
corn-mills. They are of the smallest possible size; the wheel which
drives them is horizontal, and the cogs are turned diagonally to the
water. The beam itself stands upright, and is inserted in a stone quern
of the old-fashioned construction, which it turns round, and thus
performs its duty. Had Robinson Crusoe ever been in Zetland, he would
have had no difficulty in contriving a machine for grinding corn in his
desert island. These mills are thatched over in a little hovel, which
has much the air of a pig-sty. There may be five hundred such mills on
one island, not capable any one of them of grinding above a sackful of
corn at a time.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_VII"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_53" class="pginternal">Note VII.</a>, p. 234.—<span class="smcap">The Sword-Dance.</span></p>
<p>The Sword-Dance is celebrated in general terms by Olaus Magnus. He seems
to have considered it as peculiar to the Norwegians, from whom it may
have passed to the Orkneymen and Zetlanders, with other northern
customs.</p>
<p class="center1">“<span class="smcap">Of their Dancing in Arms.</span></p>
<p>“Moreover, the northern Goths and Swedes had another sport to exercise
youth withall, that they will dance and skip amongst naked swords and
dangerous weapons. And this they do after the manner of masters of
defence, as they are taught from their youth by skilful teachers, that
dance before them, and sing to it. And this play is showed especially
about Shrovetide, called in Italian <i>Macchararum</i>. For, before
carnivals, all the youth dance for eight days together, holding their
swords up, but within the scabbards, for three times turning about; and
then they do it with their naked swords lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> up. After this, turning
more moderately, taking the points and pummels one of the other, they
change ranks, and place themselves in an triagonal figure, and this they
call <i>Rosam</i>; and presently they dissolve it by drawing back their
swords and lifting them up, that upon every one’s head there may be made
a square Rosa, and then by a most nimbly whisking their swords about
collaterally, they quickly leap back, and end the sport, which they
guide with pipes or songs, or both together; first by a more heavy, then
by a more vehement, and lastly, by a most vehement dancing. But this
speculation is scarce to be understood but by those who look on, how
comely and decent it is, when at one word, or one commanding, the whole
armed multitude is directed to fall to fight, and clergymen may exercise
themselves, and mingle themselves amongst others at this sport, because
it is all guided by most wise reason.”</p>
<p>To the Primate’s account of the sword-dance, I am able to add the words
sung or chanted, on occasion of this dance, as it is still performed in
Papa Stour, a remote island of Zetland, where alone the custom keeps its
ground. It is, it will be observed by antiquaries, a species of play or
mystery, in which the Seven Champions of Christendom make their
appearance, as in the interlude presented in “All’s Well that Ends
Well.” This dramatic curiosity was most kindly procured for my use by
Dr. Scott of Hazlar Hospital, son of my friend Mr. Scott of Mewbie,
Zetland. Mr. Hibbert has, in his Description of the Zetland Islands,
given an account of the sword-dance, but somewhat less full than the
following:</p>
<p class="center1">“<span class="smcap">Words used as a prelude to the Sword-Dance, a Danish

<p>“The six stand in rank with their swords reclining on their shoulders.
The Master (St. George) dances, and then strikes the sword of James of
Spain, who follows George, then dances, strikes the sword of Dennis, who
follows behind James. In like manner the rest—the music playing—swords
as before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> After the six are brought out of rank, they and the master
form a circle, and hold the swords point and hilt. This circle is danced
round twice. The whole, headed by the master, pass under the swords held
in a vaulted manner. They jump over the swords. This naturally places
the swords across, which they disentangle by passing under their right
sword. They take up the seven swords, and form a circle, in which they
dance round.</p>
<p>“The master runs under the sword opposite, which he jumps over
backwards. The others do the same. He then passes under the right-hand
sword, which the others follow, in which position they dance, until
commanded by the master, when they form into a circle, and dance round
as before. They then jump over the right-hand sword, by which means
their backs are to the circle, and their hands across their backs. They
dance round in that form until the master calls ‘Loose,’ when they pass
under the right sword, and are in a perfect circle.</p>
<p>“The master lays down his sword, and lays hold of the point of James’s
sword. He then turns himself, James, and the others, into a clew. When
so formed, he passes under out of the midst of the circle; the others
follow; they vault as before. After several other evolutions, they throw
themselves into a circle, with their arms across the breast. They
afterwards form such figures as to form a shield of their swords, and
the shield is so compact that the master and his knights dance
alternately with this shield upon their heads. It is then laid down upon
the floor. Each knight lays hold of their former points and hilts with
their hands across, which disentangle by figuirs directly contrary to
those that formed the shield. This finishes the Ballet.</p>

<p>The manuscript from which the above was copied was transcribed from <i>a
very old one</i>, by Mr. William Henderson, Jun., of Papa Stour, in
Zetland. Mr. Henderson’s copy is not dated, but bears his own signature,
and, from various circumstances, it is known to have been written about
the year 1788.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note_VIII"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_62" class="pginternal">Note VIII.</a>, p. 299—<span class="smcap">The Dwarfie Stone.</span></p>
<p>This is one of the wonders of the Orkney Islands, though it has been
rather undervalued by their late historian, Mr. Barry. The island of Hoy
rises abruptly, starting as it were out of the sea, which is contrary to
the gentle and flat character of the other Isles of Orkney. It consists
of a mountain, having different eminences or peaks. It is very steep,
furrowed with ravines, and placed so as to catch the mists of the
Western Ocean, and has a noble and picturesque effect from all points of
view. The highest peak is divided from another eminence, called the
Ward-hill, by a long swampy valley full of peat-bogs. Upon the slope of
this last hill, and just where the principal mountain of Hoy opens in a
hollow swamp, or corrie, lies what is called the Dwarfie Stone. It is a
great fragment of sandstone, composing one solid mass, which has long
since been detached from a belt of the same materials, cresting the
eminence above the spot where it now lies, and which has slid down till
it reached its present situation. The rock is about seven feet high,
twenty-two feet long, and seventeen feet broad. The upper end of it is
hollowed by iron tools, of which the marks are evident, into a sort of
apartment, containing two beds of stone, with a passage between them.
The uppermost and largest bed is five feet eight inches long, by two
feet broad, which was supposed to be used by the dwarf himself; the
lower couch is shorter, and rounded off, instead of being squared at the
corners. There is an entrance of about three feet and a half square, and
a stone lies before it calculated to fit the opening. A sort of skylight
window gives light to the apartment. We can only guess at the purpose of
this monument, and different ideas have been suggested. Some have
supposed it the work of some travelling mason; but the <i>cui bono</i> would
remain to be accounted for. The Rev. Mr. Barry conjectures it to be a
hermit’s cell; but it displays no symbol of Christianity, and the door
opens to the westward. The Orcadian traditions allege the work to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> be
that of a dwarf, to whom they ascribe supernatural powers, and a
malevolent disposition, the attributes of that race in Norse mythology.
Whoever inhabited this singular den certainly enjoyed</p>
<p class="center">“Pillow cold, and sheets not warm.”</p>
<p class="noidt">I observed, that commencing just opposite to the Dwarfie Stone, and
extending in a line to the sea-beach, there are a number of small
barrows, or cairns, which seem to connect the stone with a very large
cairn where we landed. This curious monument may therefore have been
intended as a temple of some kind to the Northern Dii Manes, to which
the cairns might direct worshippers.</p>

<p>“At the west end of this stone, (<i>i. e.</i> the Dwarfie Stone,) stands an
exceeding high mountain of a steep ascent, called the Ward-hill of Hoy,
near the top of which, in the months of May, June, and July, about
midnight, is seen something that shines and sparkles admirably, and
which is often seen a great way off. It hath shined more brightly
before than it does now, and though many have climbed up the hill, and
attempted to search for it, yet they could find nothing. The vulgar
talk of it as some enchanted carbuncle, but I take it rather to be some
water sliding down the face of a smooth rock, which, when the sun,
at such a time, shines upon, the reflection causeth that admirable
splendour.”—<span class="smcap">Dr. Wallace’s</span> <i>Description of the Islands of Orkney</i>,

when these formidable persons were merely champion warriors,
a kind of professional soldiery. In the “Raven Song,”
an old Norse lay, the Valkyrie asks the Raven about Harold
Fair Hair’s Bearsarks. “Wolfcoats they call them, that bear
bloody targets in battle, that redden their spear heads when
they come into fight, when they are at work together. The
wise king, I trow, will only reward men of high renown among
them that smite on the shield.” Later, perhaps, the Bearsarks
won their evil reputation, as ravening maniacs of battle,
given to biting their shields and behaving in an hysterical
manner. In such sagas as that of Grettir they are violent
bullies, sometimes selling their services. (See Powell and
Vigfussen’s “Corpus Boreale,” i. 257.)</p>

But lost to me, for ever lost those joys,<br>

</p>
<p>The moral bard, from whom we borrow the motto
of this chapter, has touched a theme with which
most readers have some feelings that vibrate unconsciously.
Superstition, when not arrayed in her
full horrors, but laying a gentle hand only on her
suppliant’s head, had charms which we fail not to
regret, even in those stages of society from which
her influence is wellnigh banished by the light of
reason and general education. At least, in more
ignorant periods, her system of ideal terrors had
something in them interesting to minds which had
few means of excitement. This is more especially
true of those lighter modifications of superstitious
feelings and practices which mingle in the amusements
of the ruder ages, and are, like the auguries
of Hallow-e’en in Scotland, considered partly as
matter of merriment, partly as sad and prophetic
earnest. And, with similar feelings, people even of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>tolerable education have, in our times, sought the
cell of a fortune-teller, upon a frolic, as it is termed,
and yet not always in a disposition absolutely sceptical
towards the responses they receive.</p>
<p>When the sisters of Burgh-Westra arrived in the
apartment destined for a breakfast, as ample as that
which we have described on the preceding morning,
and had undergone a jocular rebuke from the Udaller
for their late attendance, they found the company,
most of whom had already breakfasted, engaged in an
ancient Norwegian custom, of the character which
we have just described.</p>
<p>It seems to have been borrowed from those poems
of the Scalds, in which champions and heroines are
so often represented as seeking to know their destiny
from some sorceress or prophetess, who, as in
the legend called by Gray the Descent of Odin,
awakens by the force of Runic rhyme the unwilling
revealer of the doom of fate, and compels from her
answers, often of dubious import, but which were
then believed to express some shadow of the events
of futurity.</p>
<p>An old sibyl, Euphane Fea, the housekeeper we
have already mentioned, was installed in the recess
of a large window, studiously darkened by bear-skins
and other miscellaneous drapery, so as to give
it something the appearance of a Laplander’s hut,
and accommodated, like a confessional chair, with
an aperture, which permitted the person within to
hear with ease whatever questions should be put,
though not to see the querist. Here seated, the
voluspa, or sibyl, was to listen to the rhythmical
enquiries which should be made to her, and return
an extemporaneous answer. The drapery was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>supposed to prevent her from seeing by what individuals
she was consulted, and the intended or accidental
reference which the answer given under such
circumstances bore to the situation of the person by
whom the question was asked, often furnished food
for laughter, and sometimes, as it happened, for more
serious reflection. The sibyl was usually chosen
from her possessing the talent of improvisation
in the Norse poetry; no unusual accomplishment,
where the minds of many were stored with old
verses, and where the rules of metrical composition
are uncommonly simple. The questions were also
put in verse; but as this power of extemporaneous
composition, though common, could not be supposed
universal, the medium of an interpreter might be
used by any querist, which interpreter, holding the
consulter of the oracle by the hand, and standing
by the place from which the oracles were issued,
had the task of rendering into verse the subject of
enquiry.</p>
<p>On the present occasion, Claud Halcro was summoned,
by the universal voice, to perform the part
of interpreter; and, after shaking his head, and
muttering some apology for decay of memory and
poetical powers, contradicted at once by his own
conscious smile of confidence and by the general
shout of the company, the lighthearted old man
came forward to play his part in the proposed
entertainment.</p>
<p>But just as it was about to commence, the arrangement
of parts was singularly altered. Norna of the
Fitful-head, whom every one excepting the two sisters
believed to be at the distance of many miles, suddenly,
and without greeting, entered the apartment,
walked majestically up to the bearskin tabernacle,
and signed to the female who was there seated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
abdicate her sanctuary. The old woman came forth,
shaking her head, and looking like one overwhelmed
with fear; nor, indeed, were there many in the company
who saw with absolute composure the sudden
appearance of a person, so well known and so
generally dreaded as Norna.</p>
<p>She paused a moment at the entrance of the tent;
and, as she raised the skin which formed the entrance,
she looked up to the north, as if imploring
from that quarter a strain of inspiration; then signing
to the surprised guests that they might approach
in succession the shrine in which she was about to install
herself, she entered the tent, and was shrouded
from their sight.</p>
<p>But this was a different sport from what the company
had meditated, and to most of them seemed to
present so much more of earnest than of game, that
there was no alacrity shown to consult the oracle.
The character and pretensions of Norna seemed, to
almost all present, too serious for the part which she
had assumed; the men whispered to each other, and
the women, according to Claud Halcro, realized the
description of glorious John Dryden,—</p>
<p class="center">“With horror shuddering, in a heap they ran.”</p>
<p>The pause was interrupted by the loud manly
voice of the Udaller. “Why does the game stand
still, my masters? Are you afraid because my kinswoman
is to play our voluspa? It is kindly done in
her, to do for us what none in the isles can do so
well; and we will not baulk our sport for it, but
rather go on the merrier.”</p>
<p>There was still a pause in the company, and Magnus
Troil added, “It shall never be said that my
kinswoman sat in her bower unhalsed, as if she were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
some of the old mountain-giantesses, and all from
faint heart. I will speak first myself; but the rhyme
comes worse from my tongue than when I was a
score of years younger.—Claud Halcro, you must
stand by me.”</p>
<p>Hand in hand they approached the shrine of the
supposed sibyl, and after a moment’s consultation
together, Halcro thus expressed the query of his
friend and patron. Now, the Udaller, like many
persons of consequence in Zetland, who, as Sir Robert
Sibbald has testified for them, had begun thus
early to apply both to commerce and navigation, was
concerned to some extent in the whale-fishery of the
season, and the bard had been directed to put into
his halting verse an enquiry concerning its success.</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Claud Halcro.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Mother darksome, Mother dread—<br>
Dweller on the Fitful-head,<br>
Thou canst see what deeds are done<br>
Under the never-setting sun.<br>
Look through sleet, and look through frost,<br>
Look to Greenland’s caves and coast,—<br>
By the iceberg is a sail<br>
Chasing of the swarthy whale;<br>
Mother doubtful, Mother dread,<br>
Tell us, has the good ship sped?”<br>
</p>
<p>The jest seemed to turn to earnest, as all, bending
their heads around, listened to the voice of Norna,
who, without a moment’s hesitation, answered from
the recesses of the tent in which she was enclosed:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“The thought of the aged is ever on gear,—<br>
On his fishing, his furrow, his flock, and his steer;<br>
But thrive may his fishing, flock, furrow, and herd,<br>
While the aged for anguish shall tear his grey beard.”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a momentary pause, during which Triptolemus
had time to whisper, “If ten witches and as
many warlocks were to swear it, I will never believe
that a decent man will either fash his beard or
himself about any thing, so long as stock and crop
goes as it should do.”</p>
<p>But the voice from within the tent resumed its
low monotonous tone of recitation, and, interrupting
farther commentary, proceeded as follows:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“The ship, well-laden as bark need be,<br>
Lies deep in the furrow of the Iceland sea;—<br>
The breeze for Zetland blows fair and soft,<br>
And gaily the garland<a id="FNanchor2_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_1_1">[1]</a> is fluttering aloft:<br>
Seven good fishes have spouted their last,<br>
And their jaw-bones are hanging to yard and mast;<a id="FNanchor2_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_2_2">[2]</a><br>
Two are for Lerwick, and two for Kirkwall,—<br>
And three for Burgh-Westra, the choicest of all.”<br>
</p>
<p>“Now the powers above look down and protect
us!” said Bryce Snailsfoot; “for it is mair than
woman’s wit that has spaed out that ferly. I saw
them at North Ronaldshaw, that had seen the good
bark, the Olave of Lerwick, that our worthy patron
has such a great share in that she may be called his
own in a manner, and they had broomed<a id="FNanchor2_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_3_3">[3]</a> the ship,
and, as sure as there are stars in heaven, she answered
them for seven fish, exact as Norna has telled
us in her rhyme!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Umph—seven fish exactly? and you heard it at
North Ronaldshaw?” said Captain Cleveland, “and
I suppose told it as a good piece of news when you
came hither?”</p>
<p>“It never crossed my tongue, Captain,” answered
the pedlar; “I have kend mony chapmen, travelling
merchants, and such like, neglect their goods to carry
clashes and clavers up and down, from one countryside
to another; but that is no traffic of mine. I
dinna believe I have mentioned the Olave’s having
made up her cargo to three folks since I crossed to
Dunrossness.”</p>
<p>“But if one of those three had spoken the news
over again, and it is two to one that such a thing
happened, the old lady prophesies upon velvet.”</p>
<p>Such was the speech of Cleveland, addressed to
Magnus Troil, and heard without any applause.
The Udaller’s respect for his country extended to
its superstitions, and so did the interest which he
took in his unfortunate kinswoman. If he never rendered
a precise assent to her high supernatural pretensions,
he was not at least desirous of hearing
them disputed by others.</p>
<p>“Norna,” he said, “his cousin,” (an emphasis on
the word,) “held no communication with Bryce
Snailsfoot, or his acquaintances. He did not pretend
to explain how she came by her information; but he
had always remarked that Scotsmen, and indeed
strangers in general, when they came to Zetland, were
ready to find reasons for things which remained sufficiently
obscure to those whose ancestors had dwelt
there for ages.”</p>
<p>Captain Cleveland took the hint, and bowed, without
attempting to defend his own scepticism.</p>
<p>“And now forward, my brave hearts,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Udaller; “and may all have as good tidings as I
have! Three whales cannot but yield—let me
think how many hogsheads”——</p>
<p>There was an obvious reluctance on the part of
the guests to be the next in consulting the oracle of
the tent.</p>
<p>“Gude news are welcome to some folks, if they
came frae the deil himsell,” said Mistress Baby
Yellowley, addressing the Lady Glowrowrum,—for
a similarity of disposition in some respects had
made a sort of intimacy betwixt them—“but I
think, my leddy, that this has ower mickle of rank
witchcraft in it to have the countenance of douce
Christian folks like you and me, my leddy.”</p>
<p>“There may be something in what you say, my
dame,” replied the good Lady Glowrowrum; “but
we Hialtlanders are no just like other folks; and
this woman, if she be a witch, being the Fowd’s
friend and near kinswoman, it will be ill taen if we
haena our fortunes spaed like a’ the rest of them;
and sae my nieces may e’en step forward in their
turn, and nae harm dune. They will hae time to
repent, ye ken, in the course of nature, if there be
ony thing wrang in it, Mistress Yellowley.”</p>
<p>While others remained under similar uncertainty
and apprehension, Halcro, who saw by the knitting
of the old Udaller’s brows, and by a certain
impatient shuffle of his right foot, like the motion
of a man who with difficulty refrains from stamping,
that his patience began to wax rather thin, gallantly
declared, that he himself would, in his own person,
and not as a procurator for others, put the next
query to the Pythoness. He paused a minute—collected
his rhymes, and thus addressed her:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Claud Halcro.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Mother doubtful, Mother dread,<br>
Dweller of the Fitful-head,<br>
Thou hast conn’d full many a rhyme,<br>
That lives upon the surge of time:<br>
Tell me, shall my lays be sung,<br>
Like Hacon’s of the golden tongue,<br>
Long after Halcro’s dead and gone?<br>
Or, shall Hialtland’s minstrel own<br>
One note to rival glorious John?”<br>
</p>
<p>The voice of the sibyl immediately replied, from
her sanctuary,</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“The infant loves the rattle’s noise;<br>
Age, double childhood, hath its toys;<br>
But different far the descant rings,<br>
As strikes a different hand the strings.<br>
The Eagle mounts the polar sky—<br>
The Imber-goose, unskill’d to fly,<br>
Must be content to glide along,<br>
Where seal and sea-dog list his song.”<br>
</p>
<p>Halcro bit his lip, shrugged his shoulders, and
then, instantly recovering his good-humour, and the
ready, though slovenly power of extemporaneous
composition, with which long habit had invested
him, he gallantly rejoined,</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Claud Halcro.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Be mine the Imber-goose to play,<br>
And haunt lone cave and silent bay:—<br>
The archer’s aim so shall I shun—<br>
So shall I ’scape the levell’d gun—<br>
Content my verse’s tuneless jingle,<br>
With Thule’s sounding tides to mingle,<br>
While, to the ear of wandering wight,<br>
Upon the distant headland’s height,<br>
Soften’d by murmur of the sea,<br>
The rude sounds seem like harmony!”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>As the little bard stepped back, with an alert
gait, and satisfied air, general applause followed
the spirited manner in which he had acquiesced in
the doom which levelled him with an Imber-goose.
But his resigned and courageous submission did
not even yet encourage any other person to consult
the redoubted Norna.</p>
<p>“The coward fools!” said the Udaller. “Are you
too afraid, Captain Cleveland, to speak to an old woman?—Ask
her any thing—ask her whether the
twelve-gun sloop at Kirkwall be your consort or no.”</p>
<p>Cleveland looked at Minna, and probably conceiving
that she watched with anxiety his answer
to her father’s question, he collected himself, after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>
<p>“I never was afraid of man or woman.—Master
Halcro, you have heard the question which our host
desires me to ask—put it in my name, and in your
own way—I pretend to as little skill in poetry as I
do in witchcraft.”</p>
<p>Halcro did not wait to be invited twice, but,
grasping Captain Cleveland’s hand in his, according
to the form which the game prescribed, he put
the query which the Udaller had dictated to the
stranger, in the following words:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Claud Halcro.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Mother doubtful, Mother dread,<br>
Dweller of the Fitful-head,<br>
A gallant bark from far abroad,<br>
Saint Magnus hath her in his road,<br>
With guns and firelocks not a few—<br>
A silken and a scarlet crew,<br>
Deep stored with precious merchandise,<br>
Of gold, and goods of rare device—<br>
What interest hath our comrade bold<br>
In bark and crew, in goods and gold?”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a pause of unusual duration ere the
oracle would return any answer; and when she replied,
it was in a lower, though an equally decided
tone, with that which she had hitherto employed:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Gold is ruddy, fair, and free,<br>
Blood is crimson, and dark to see;—<br>
I look’d out on Saint Magnus Bay,<br>
And I saw a falcon that struck her prey,—<br>
A gobbet of flesh in her beak she bore,<br>
And talons and singles are dripping with gore;<br>
Let him that asks after them look on his hand,<br>
And if there is blood on’t, he’s one of their band.”<br>
</p>
<p>Cleveland smiled scornfully, and held out his
hand,—“Few men have been on the Spanish main
as often as I have, without having had to do with
the <i>Guarda Costas</i> once and again; but there never
was aught like a stain on my hand that a wet towel
would not wipe away.”</p>
<p>The Udaller added his voice potential—“There
is never peace with Spaniards beyond the Line,—I
have heard Captain Tragendeck and honest old
Commodore Rummelaer say so an hundred times,
and they have both been down in the Bay of Honduras,
and all thereabouts.—I hate all Spaniards,
since they came here and reft the Fair Isle men of
their vivers in 1558.<a id="FNanchor2_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_4_4">[4]</a> I have heard my grandfather
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>speak of it; and there is an old Dutch history
somewhere about the house, that shows what
work they made in the Low Countries long since.
There is neither mercy nor faith in them.”</p>
<p>“True—true, my old friend,” said Cleveland;
“they are as jealous of their Indian possessions as
an old man of his young bride; and if they can
catch you at disadvantage, the mines for your life
is the word,—and so we fight them with our colours
nailed to the mast.”</p>
<p>“That is the way,” shouted the Udaller; “the
old British jack should never down! When I think
of the wooden walls, I almost think myself an Englishman,
only it would be becoming too like my
Scottish neighbours;—but come, no offence to any
here, gentlemen—all are friends, and all are welcome.—Come,
Brenda, go on with the play—do
you speak next, you have Norse rhymes enough, we
all know.”</p>
<p>“But none that suit the game we play at, father,”
said Brenda, drawing back.</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” said her father, pushing her onward,
while Halcro seized on her reluctant hand;
“never let mistimed modesty mar honest mirth—Speak
for Brenda, Halcro—it is your trade to interpret
maidens’ thoughts.”</p>
<p>The poet bowed to the beautiful young woman,
with the devotion of a poet and the gallantry of a
traveller, and having, in a whisper, reminded her
that she was in no way responsible for the nonsense
he was about to speak, he paused, looked upward,
simpered as if he had caught a sudden idea, and at
length set off in the following verses:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Claud Halcro.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Mother doubtful, Mother dread—<br>
Dweller of the Fitful-head,<br>
Well thou know’st it is thy task<br>
To tell what beauty will not ask;—<br>
Then steep thy words in wine and milk,<br>
And weave a doom of gold and silk,—<br>
For we would know, shall Brenda prove<br>
In love, and happy in her love?”<br>
</p>
<p>The prophetess replied almost immediately from
behind her curtain:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Untouched by love, the maiden’s breast<br>
Is like the snow on Rona’s crest,<br>
High seated in the middle sky,<br>
In bright and barren purity;<br>
But by the sunbeam gently kiss’d,<br>
Scarce by the gazing eye ’tis miss’d,<br>
Ere down the lonely valley stealing,<br>
Fresh grass and growth its course revealing,<br>
It cheers the flock, revives the flower,<br>
And decks some happy shepherd’s bower.”<br>
</p>
<p>“A comfortable doctrine, and most justly spoken,”
said the Udaller, seizing the blushing Brenda,
as she was endeavouring to escape—“Never think
shame for the matter, my girl. To be the mistress
of some honest man’s house, and the means of
maintaining some old Norse name, making neighbours
happy, the poor easy, and relieving strangers,
is the most creditable lot a young woman can look
to, and I heartily wish it to all here.—Come, who
speaks next?—good husbands are going—Maddie
Groatsettar—my pretty Clara, come and have your
share.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>”</p>
<p>The Lady Glowrowrum shook her head, and
“could not,” she said, “altogether approve”——</p>
<p>“Enough said—enough said,” replied Magnus;
“no compulsion; but the play shall go on till we
are tired of it. Here, Minna—I have got you at
command. Stand forth, my girl—there are plenty
of things to be ashamed of besides old-fashioned and
innocent pleasantry.—Come, I will speak for you
myself—though I am not sure I can remember
rhyme enough for it.”</p>
<p>There was a slight colour which passed rapidly
over Minna’s face, but she instantly regained her
composure, and stood erect by her father, as one superior
to any little jest to which her situation might
give rise.</p>
<p>Her father, after some rubbing of his brow, and
other mechanical efforts to assist his memory, at
length recovered verse sufficient to put the following
query, though in less gallant strains than those
of Halcro:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Magnus Troil.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Mother, speak, and do not tarry,<br>
Here’s a maiden fain would marry.<br>
Shall she marry, ay or not?<br>
If she marry, what’s her lot?”<br>
</p>
<p>A deep sigh was uttered within the tabernacle of
the soothsayer, as if she compassionated the subject
of the doom which she was obliged to pronounce.
She then, as usual, returned her response:—</p>
<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Norna.</span></p>
<p class="poem">
“Untouch’d by love, the maiden’s breast<br>
Is like the snow on Rona’s crest;<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>So pure, so free from earthly dye,<br>
It seems, whilst leaning on the sky,<br>
Part of the heaven to which ’tis nigh;<br>
But passion, like the wild March rain,<br>
May soil the wreath with many a stain.<br>
We gaze—the lovely vision’s gone—<br>
A torrent fills the bed of stone,<br>
That, hurrying to destruction’s shock,<br>
Leaps headlong from the lofty rock.”<br>
</p>
<p>The Udaller heard this reply with high resentment.
“By the bones of the Martyr,” he said, his
bold visage becoming suddenly ruddy, “this is an
abuse of courtesy! and, were it any but yourself
that had classed my daughter’s name and the word
destruction together, they had better have left the
word unspoken. But come forth of the tent, thou
old galdragon,”<a id="FNanchor2_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_5_5">[5]</a> he added, with a smile—“I should
have known that thou canst not long joy in any
thing that smacks of mirth, God help thee!” His
summons received no answer; and, after waiting a
moment, he again addressed her—“Nay, never be
sullen with me, kinswoman, though I did speak a
hasty word—thou knowest I bear malice to no one,
least of all to thee—so come forth, and let us shake
hands.—Thou mightst have foretold the wreck of
my ship and boats, or a bad herring-fishery, and I
should have said never a word; but Minna or
Brenda, you know, are things which touch me
nearer. But come out, shake hands, and there let
there be an end on’t.”</p>
<p>Norna returned no answer whatever to his repeated
invocations, and the company began to look
upon each other with some surprise, when the
Udaller, raising the skin which covered the entrance
of the tent, discovered that the interior was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
empty. The wonder was now general, and not unmixed
with fear; for it seemed impossible that Norna
could have, in any manner, escaped from the tabernacle
in which she was enclosed, without having
been discovered by the company. Gone, however,
she was, and the Udaller, after a moment’s consideration,
dropt the skin-curtain again over the entrance
of the tent.</p>
<p>“My friends,” he said, with a cheerful countenance,
“we have long known my kinswoman, and
that her ways are not like those of the ordinary
folks of this world. But she means well by Hialtland,
and hath the love of a sister for me, and for
my house; and no guest of mine needs either to
fear evil, or to take offence, at her hand. I have little
doubt she will be with us at dinner-time.”</p>
<p>“Now, Heaven forbid!” said Mrs. Baby Yellowley—“for,
my gude Leddy Glowrowrum, to tell
your leddyship the truth, I likena cummers that can
come and gae like a glance of the sun, or the whisk
of a whirlwind.”</p>
<p>“Speak lower, speak lower,” said the Lady Glowrowrum,
“and be thankful that yon carlin hasna
ta’en the house-side away wi’ her. The like of her
have played warse pranks, and so has she hersell,
unless she is the sairer lied on.”</p>
<p>Similar murmurs ran through the rest of the company,
until the Udaller uplifted his stentorian and
imperative voice to put them to silence, and invited,
or rather commanded, the attendance of his guests
to behold the boats set off for the <i>haaf</i> or deep-sea
fishing.</p>
<p>“The wind has been high since sunrise,” he said,
“and had kept the boats in the bay; but now it was
favourable, and they would sail immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>”</p>
<p>This sudden alteration of the weather occasioned
sundry nods and winks amongst the guests, who
were not indisposed to connect it with Norna’s sudden
disappearance; but without giving vent to observations
which could not but be disagreeable to
their host, they followed his stately step to the shore,
as the herd of deer follows the leading stag, with
all manner of respectful observance.<a id="FNanchor2_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_6_6">[6]</a><a id="FNanchor2_A_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_A_7">(<i>a</i>)</a><a id="FNanchor2_7_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_7_8">[7]</a></p>

<p class="poem">
There was a laughing devil in his sneer,<br>
That raised emotions both of rage and fear;<br>
And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,<br>
Hope withering fled—and Mercy sigh’d farewell.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>The Corsair, Canto I.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The ling or white fishery is the principal employment
of the natives of Zetland, and was formerly
that upon which the gentry chiefly depended for
their income, and the poor for their subsistence. The
fishing season is therefore, like the harvest of an
agricultural country, the busiest and most important,
as well as the most animating, period of the year.</p>
<p>The fishermen of each district assemble at particular
stations, with their boats and crews, and
erect upon the shore small huts, composed of shingle
and covered with turf, for their temporary lodging,
and skeos, or drying-houses, for the fish; so that
the lonely beach at once assumes the appearance
of an Indian town. The banks to which
they repair for the Haaf fishing, are often many
miles distant from the station where the fish is
dried; so that they are always twenty or thirty
hours absent, frequently longer; and under unfavourable
circumstances of wind and tide, they remain
at sea, with a very small stock of provisions,
and in a boat of a construction which seems extremely
slender, for two or three days, and are
sometimes heard of no more. The departure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the fishers, therefore, on this occupation, has in it
a character of danger and of suffering, which renders
it dignified, and the anxiety of the females
who remain on the beach, watching the departure
of the lessening boat, or anxiously looking out for
its return, gives pathos to the scene.<a id="FNanchor2_8_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_8_9">[8]</a></p>
<p>The scene, therefore, was in busy and anxious
animation, when the Udaller and his friends appeared
on the beach. The various crews of about
thirty boats, amounting each to from three to five
or six men, were taking leave of their wives and
female relatives, and jumping on board their long
Norway skiffs, where their lines and tackle lay ready
stowed. Magnus was not an idle spectator of the
scene; he went from one place to another, enquiring
into the state of their provisions for the voyage, and
their preparations for the fishing—now and then,
with a rough Dutch or Norse oath, abusing them
for blockheads, for going to sea with their boats
indifferently found, but always ending by ordering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
from his own stores a gallon of gin, a lispund of
meal, or some similar essential addition to their
sea-stores. The hardy sailors, on receiving such
favours, expressed their thanks in the brief gruff
manner which their landlord best approved; but the
women were more clamorous in their gratitude,
which Magnus was often obliged to silence by
cursing all female tongues from Eve’s downwards.</p>
<p>At length all were on board and ready, the sails
were hoisted, the signal for departure given, the
rowers began to pull, and all started from the shore,
in strong emulation to get first to the fishing ground,
and to have their lines set before the rest; an exploit
to which no little consequence was attached
by the boat’s crew who should be happy enough
to perform it.</p>
<p>While they were yet within hearing of the shore,
they chanted an ancient Norse ditty, appropriate
to the occasion, of which Claud Halcro had executed
the following literal translation:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Farewell, merry maidens, to song, and to laugh,<br>
For the brave lads of Westra are bound to the Haaf;<br>
And we must have labour, and hunger, and pain,<br>
Ere we dance with the maids of Dunrossness again.<br>
<br>
“For now, in our trim boats of Noroway deal,<br>
We must dance on the waves, with the porpoise and seal;<br>
The breeze it shall pipe, so it pipe not too high,<br>
And the gull be our songstress whene’er she flits by.<br>
<br>
“Sing on, my brave bird, while we follow, like thee,<br>
By bank, shoal, and quicksand, the swarms of the sea;<br>
And when twenty-score fishes are straining our line,<br>
Sing louder, brave bird, for their spoils shall be thine.<br>
<br>
“We’ll sing while we bait, and we’ll sing when we haul,<br>
For the deeps of the Haaf have enough for us all:<br>
There is torsk for the gentle, and skate for the carle,<br>
And there’s wealth for bold Magnus, the son of the earl.<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><br>
“Huzza! my brave comrades, give way for the Haaf,<br>
We shall sooner come back to the dance and the laugh;<br>
For life without mirth is a lamp without oil;<br>
Then, mirth and long life to the bold Magnus Troil!”<br>
</p>
<p>The rude words of the song were soon drowned
in the ripple of the waves, but the tune continued
long to mingle with the sound of wind and sea, and
the boats were like so many black specks on the
surface of the ocean, diminishing by degrees as they
bore far and farther seaward; while the ear could
distinguish touches of the human voice, almost
drowned amid that of the elements.</p>
<p>The fishermen’s wives looked their last after the
parting sails, and were now departing slowly, with
downcast and anxious looks, towards the huts in
which they were to make arrangements for preparing
and drying the fish, with which they hoped
to see their husbands and friends return deeply
laden. Here and there an old sibyl displayed the
superior importance of her experience, by predicting,
from the appearance of the atmosphere, that the
wind would be fair or foul, while others recommended
a vow to the Kirk of St. Ninian’s for the
safety of their men and boats, (an ancient Catholic
superstition, not yet wholly abolished,) and others,
but in a low and timorous tone, regretted to their
companions, that Norna of Fitful-head had been
suffered to depart in discontent that morning from
Burgh-Westra, “and, of all days in the year, that
they suld have contrived to give her displeasure on
the first day of the white fishing!”</p>
<p>The gentry, guests of Magnus Troil, having whiled
away as much time as could be so disposed of, in
viewing the little armament set sail, and in conversing
with the poor women who had seen their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
friends embark in it, began now to separate into
various groups and parties, which strolled in different
directions, as fancy led them, to enjoy what
may be called the clair-obscure of a Zetland summer
day, which, though without the brilliant sunshine
that cheers other countries during the fine
season, has a mild and pleasing character of its own,
that softens while it saddens landscapes, which, in
their own lonely, bare, and monotonous tone, have
something in them stern as well as barren.</p>
<p>In one of the loneliest recesses of the coast,
where a deep indenture of the rocks gave the tide
access to the cavern, or, as it is called, the <i>Helyer</i>,
of Swartaster, Minna Troil was walking with Captain
Cleveland. They had probably chosen that
walk, as being little liable to interruption from
others; for, as the force of the tide rendered the
place unfit either for fishing or sailing, so it was not
the ordinary resort of walkers, on account of its
being the supposed habitation of a Mermaid, a race
which Norwegian superstition invests with magical,
as well as mischievous qualities. Here, therefore,
Minna wandered with her lover.</p>
<p>A small spot of milk-white sand, that stretched
beneath one of the precipices which walled in the
creek on either side, afforded them space for a dry,
firm, and pleasant walk of about an hundred yards,
terminated at one extremity by a dark stretch of
the bay, which, scarce touched by the wind, seemed
almost as smooth as glass, and which was seen from
between two lofty rocks, the jaws of the creek, or
indenture, that approached each other above, as if
they wished to meet over the dark tide that separated
them. The other end of their promenade was
closed by a lofty and almost unscaleable precipice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the abode of hundreds of sea-fowl of different kinds,
in the bottom of which the huge helyer, or sea-cave,
itself yawned, as if for the purpose of swallowing
up the advancing tide, which it seemed to receive
into an abyss of immeasurable depth and extent.
The entrance to this dismal cavern consisted not in
a single arch, as usual, but was divided into two, by
a huge pillar of natural rock, which, rising out of
the sea, and extending to the top of the cavern,
seemed to lend its support to the roof, and thus
formed a double portal to the helyer, on which the
fishermen and peasants had bestowed the rude name
of the Devil’s Nostrils. In this wild scene, lonely
and undisturbed but by the clang of the sea-fowl,
Cleveland had already met with Minna Troil more
than once; for with her it was a favourite walk, as
the objects which it presented agreed peculiarly
with the love of the wild, the melancholy, and the
wonderful. But now the conversation in which she
was earnestly engaged, was such as entirely to
withdraw her attention, as well as that of her companion,
from the scenery around them.</p>
<p>“You cannot deny it,” she said; “you have given
way to feelings respecting this young man, which
indicate prejudice and violence,—the prejudice unmerited,
as far as you are concerned at least, and
the violence equally imprudent and unjustifiable.”</p>
<p>“I should have thought,” replied Cleveland, “that
the service I rendered him yesterday might have
freed me from such a charge. I do not talk of my
own risk, for I have lived in danger, and love it; it
is not every one, however, would have ventured so
near the furious animal to save one with whom they
had no connexion.”</p>
<p>“It is not every one, indeed, who could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
saved him,” answered Minna, gravely; “but every
one who has courage and generosity would have attempted
it. The giddy-brained Claud Halcro would
have done as much as you, had his strength been
equal to his courage,—my father would have done
as much, though having such just cause of resentment
against the young man, for his vain and braggart
abuse of our hospitality. Do not, therefore,
boast of your exploit too much, my good friend, lest
you should make me think that it required too great
an effort. I know you love not Mordaunt Mertoun,
though you exposed your own life to save his.”</p>
<p>“Will you allow nothing, then,” said Cleveland,
“for the long misery I was made to endure from
the common and prevailing report, that this beardless
bird-hunter stood betwixt me and what I on
earth coveted most—the affections of Minna Troil?”</p>
<p>He spoke in a tone at once impassioned and
insinuating, and his whole language and manner
seemed to express a grace and elegance, which
formed the most striking contrast with the speech
and gesture of the unpolished seaman, which he
usually affected or exhibited. But his apology was
unsatisfactory to Minna.</p>
<p>“You have known,” she said, “perhaps too soon,
and too well, how little you had to fear,—if you
indeed feared,—that Mertoun, or any other, had
interest with Minna Troil.—Nay, truce to thanks
and protestations; I would accept it as the best proof
of gratitude, that you would be reconciled with this
youth, or at least avoid every quarrel with him.”</p>
<p>“That we should be friends, Minna, is impossible,”
replied Cleveland; “even the love I bear you, the
most powerful emotion that my heart ever knew,
cannot work that miracle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“And why, I pray you?” said Minna; “there
have been no evil offences between you, but rather
an exchange of mutual services; why can you not
be friends?—I have many reasons to wish it.”</p>
<p>“And can you, then, forget the slights which he
has cast upon Brenda, and on yourself, and on your
father’s house?”</p>
<p>“I can forgive them all,” said Minna;—“can
you not say so much, who have in truth received
no offence?”</p>
<p>Cleveland looked down, and paused for an instant;
then raised his head, and replied, “I might easily
deceive you, Minna, and promise you what my
soul tells me is an impossibility; but I am forced
to use too much deceit with others, and with you
I will use none. I cannot be friend to this young
man;—there is a natural dislike—an instinctive
aversion—something like a principle of repulsion
in our mutual nature, which makes us odious to
each other. Ask himself—he will tell you he has
the same antipathy against me. The obligation he
conferred on me was a bridle to my resentment;
but I was so galled by the restraint, that I could
have gnawed the curb till my lips were bloody.”</p>
<p>“You have worn what you are wont to call your
iron mask so long, that your features,” replied
Minna, “retain the impression of its rigidity even
when it is removed.”</p>
<p>“You do me injustice, Minna,” replied her lover,
“and you are angry with me because I deal with
you plainly and honestly. Plainly and honestly,
however, will I say, that I cannot be Mertoun’s
friend, but it shall be his own fault, not mine, if I
am ever his enemy. I seek not to injure him; but
do not ask me to love him. And of this remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
satisfied, that it would be vain even if I could do so;
for as sure as I attempted any advances towards his
confidence, so sure would I be to awaken his disgust
and suspicion. Leave us to the exercise of our natural
feelings, which, as they will unquestionably
keep us as far separate as possible, are most likely
to prevent any possible interference with each other.—Does
this satisfy you?”</p>
<p>“It must,” said Minna, “since you tell me there
is no remedy.—And now tell me why you looked
so grave when you heard of your consort’s arrival,—for
that it is her I have no doubt,—in the port
of Kirkwall?”</p>
<p>“I fear,” replied Cleveland, “the consequences
of that vessel’s arrival with her crew, as comprehending
the ruin of my fondest hopes. I had made
some progress in your father’s favour, and, with
time, might have made more, when hither come
Hawkins and the rest to blight my prospects for
ever. I told you on what terms we parted. I then
commanded a vessel braver and better found than
their own, with a crew who, at my slightest nod,
would have faced fiends armed with their own fiery
element; but I now stand alone, a single man, destitute
of all means to overawe or to restrain them;
and they will soon show so plainly the ungovernable
license of their habits and dispositions, that
ruin to themselves and to me will in all probability
be the consequence.”</p>
<p>“Do not fear it,” said Minna; “my father can
never be so unjust as to hold you liable for the
offences of others.”</p>
<p>“But what will Magnus Troil say to my own
demerits, fair Minna?” said Cleveland, smiling.</p>
<p>“My father is a Zetlander, or rather a Norwegian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>”
said Minna, “one of an oppressed race, who will
not care whether you fought against the Spaniards,
who are the tyrants of the New World, or against
the Dutch and English, who have succeeded to
their usurped dominions. His own ancestors supported
and exercised the freedom of the seas in
those gallant barks, whose pennons were the dread
of all Europe.”</p>
<p>“I fear, nevertheless,” said Cleveland, “that the
descendant of an ancient Sea-King will scarce acknowledge
a fitting acquaintance in a modern rover.
I have not disguised from you that I have reason to
dread the English laws; and Magnus, though a great
enemy to taxes, imposts, scat, wattle, and so forth,
has no idea of latitude upon points of a more general
character;—he would willingly reeve a rope to the
yard-arm for the benefit of an unfortunate buccanier.”</p>
<p>“Do not suppose so,” said Minna; “he himself
suffers too much oppression from the tyrannical laws
of our proud neighbours of Scotland. I trust he
will soon be able to rise in resistance against them.
The enemy—such I will call them—are now
divided amongst themselves, and every vessel from
their coast brings intelligence of fresh commotions—the
Highlands against the Lowlands—the Williamites
against the Jacobites—the Whigs against
the Tories, and, to sum the whole, the kingdom of
England against that of Scotland. What is there,
as Claud Halcro well hinted, to prevent our availing
ourselves of the quarrels of these robbers, to assert
the independence of which we are deprived?”</p>
<p>“To hoist the raven standard on the Castle of
Scalloway,” said Cleveland, in imitation of her tone
and manner, “and proclaim your father Earl Magnus
the First!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Earl Magnus the Seventh, if it please you,”
answered Minna; “for six of his ancestors have
worn, or were entitled to wear, the coronet before
him.—You laugh at my ardour,—but what <i>is</i>
there to prevent all this?”</p>
<p>“Nothing <i>will</i> prevent it,” replied Cleveland,
“because it will never be attempted—Any thing
<i>might</i> prevent it, that is equal in strength to the
long-boat of a British man-of-war.”</p>
<p>“You treat us with scorn, sir,” said Minna;
“yet yourself should know what a few resolved
men may perform.”</p>
<p>“But they must be armed, Minna,” replied Cleveland,
“and willing to place their lives upon each
desperate adventure.—Think not of such visions.
Denmark has been cut down into a second-rate
kingdom, incapable of exchanging a single broadside
with England; Norway is a starving wilderness;
and, in these islands, the love of independence
has been suppressed by a long term of subjection,
or shows itself but in a few muttered growls over
the bowl and bottle. And, were your men as willing
warriors as their ancestors, what could the unarmed
crews of a few fishing-boats do against the
British navy?—Think no more of it, sweet Minna—it
is a dream, and I must term it so, though it
makes your eye so bright, and your step so noble.”</p>
<p>“It is indeed a dream!” said Minna, looking
down, “and it ill becomes a daughter of Hialtland
to look or to move like a freewoman—Our eye
should be on the ground, and our step slow and reluctant,
as that of one who obeys a taskmaster.”</p>
<p>“There are lands,” said Cleveland, “in which
the eye may look bright upon groves of the palm
and the cocoa, and where the foot may move light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
as a galley under sail, over fields carpeted with
flowers, and savannahs surrounded by aromatic
thickets, and where subjection is unknown, except
that of the brave to the bravest, and of all to the
most beautiful.”</p>
<p>Minna paused a moment ere she spoke, and then
answered, “No, Cleveland. My own rude country
has charms for me, even desolate as you think it,
and depressed as it surely is, which no other land
on earth can offer to me. I endeavour in vain to
represent to myself those visions of trees, and of
groves, which my eye never saw; but my imagination
can conceive no sight in nature more sublime
than these waves, when agitated by a storm, or more
beautiful, than when they come, as they now do,
rolling in calm tranquillity to the shore. Not the
fairest scene in a foreign land,—not the brightest
sunbeam that ever shone upon the richest landscape,
would win my thoughts for a moment from
that lofty rock, misty hill, and wide-rolling ocean.
Hialtland is the land of my deceased ancestors, and
of my living father; and in Hialtland will I live
and die.”</p>
<p>“Then in Hialtland,” answered Cleveland, “will
I too live and die. I will not go to Kirkwall,—I
will not make my existence known to my comrades,
from whom it were else hard for me to escape.
Your father loves me, Minna; who knows whether
long attention, anxious care, might not bring him
to receive me into his family? Who would regard
the length of a voyage that was certain to terminate
in happiness?”</p>
<p>“Dream not of such an issue,” said Minna; “it
is impossible. While you live in my father’s house,—while
you receive his assistance, and share his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
table, you will find him the generous friend, and
the hearty host; but touch him on what concerns
his name and family, and the frank-hearted Udaller
will start up before you the haughty and proud descendant
of a Norwegian Jarl. See you,—a moment’s
suspicion has fallen on Mordaunt Mertoun,
and he has banished from his favour the youth
whom he so lately loved as a son. No one must
ally with his house that is not of untainted northern
descent.”</p>
<p>“And mine may be so, for aught that is known
to me upon the subject,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“How!” said Minna; “have you any reason to
believe yourself of Norse descent?”</p>
<p>“I have told you before,” replied Cleveland, “that
my family is totally unknown to me. I spent my
earliest days upon a solitary plantation in the little
island of Tortuga, under the charge of my father,
then a different person from what he afterwards became.
We were plundered by the Spaniards, and
reduced to such extremity of poverty, that my
father, in desperation, and in thirst of revenge,
took up arms, and having become chief of a little
band, who were in the same circumstances, became
a buccanier, as it is called, and cruized against
Spain, with various vicissitudes of good and bad
fortune, until, while he interfered to check some
violence of his companions, he fell by their hands—no
uncommon fate among the captains of these
rovers. But whence my father came, or what was
the place of his birth, I know not, fair Minna, nor
have I ever had a curious thought on the subject.”</p>
<p>“He was a Briton, at least, your unfortunate
father?” said Minna.</p>
<p>“I have no doubt of it,” said Cleveland; “his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
name, which I have rendered too formidable to be
openly spoken, is an English one; and his acquaintance
with the English language, and even with English
literature, together with the pains which he
took, in better days, to teach me both, plainly spoke
him to be an Englishman. If the rude bearing
which I display towards others is not the genuine
character of my mind and manners, it is to my
father, Minna, that I owe any share of better
thoughts and principles, which may render me
worthy, in some small degree, of your notice and
approbation. And yet it sometimes seems to me,
that I have two different characters; for I cannot
bring myself to believe, that I, who now walk this
lone beach with the lovely Minna Troil, and am
permitted to speak to her of the passion which I
have cherished, have ever been the daring leader of
the bold band whose name was as terrible as a
tornado.”</p>
<p>“You had not been permitted,” said Minna, “to
use that bold language towards the daughter of
Magnus Troil, had you <i>not</i> been the brave and undaunted
leader, who, with so small means, has made
his name so formidable. My heart is like that of
a maiden of the ancient days, and is to be won, not
by fair words, but by gallant deeds.”</p>
<p>“Alas! that heart,” said Cleveland; “and what
is it that I may do—what is it that man can do, to
win in it the interest which I desire?”</p>
<p>“Rejoin your friends—pursue your fortunes—leave
the rest to destiny,” said Minna. “Should
you return, the leader of a gallant fleet, who can
tell what may befall?”</p>
<p>“And what shall assure me, that, when I return—if
return I ever shall—I may not find Minna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Troil a bride or a spouse?—No, Minna, I will not
trust to destiny the only object worth attaining,
which my stormy voyage in life has yet offered
me.”</p>
<p>“Hear me,” said Minna. “I will bind myself to
you, if you dare accept such an engagement, by the
promise of Odin,<a id="FNanchor2_9_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_9_10">[9]</a> the most sacred of our northern
rites which are yet practised among us, that I will
never favour another, until you resign the pretensions
which I have given to you.—Will that satisfy
you?—for more I cannot—more I will not give.”</p>
<p>“Then with that,” said Cleveland, after a moment’s
pause, “I must perforce be satisfied;—but
remember, it is yourself that throw me back upon
a mode of life which the laws of Britain denounce
as criminal, and which the violent passions of the
daring men by whom it is pursued, have rendered
infamous.”</p>
<p>“But I,” said Minna, “am superior to such prejudices.
In warring with England, I see their laws
in no other light than as if you were engaged with
an enemy, who, in fulness of pride and power, has
declared he will give his antagonist no quarter. A
brave man will not fight the worse for this;—and,
for the manners of your comrades, so that they do
not infect your own, why should their evil report
attach to you?”</p>
<p>Cleveland gazed at her as she spoke, with a degree
of wondering admiration, in which, at the same time,
there lurked a smile at her simplicity.</p>
<p>“I could not,” he said, “have believed, that such
high courage could have been found united with
such ignorance of the world, as the world is now
wielded. For my manners, they who best know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
me will readily allow, that I have done my best, at
the risk of my popularity, and of my life itself, to
mitigate the ferocity of my mates; but how can you
teach humanity to men burning with vengeance
against the world by whom they are proscribed, or
teach them temperance and moderation in enjoying
the pleasures which chance throws in their way, to
vary a life which would be otherwise one constant
scene of peril and hardship?—But this promise,
Minna—this promise, which is all I am to receive
in guerdon for my faithful attachment—let me at
least lose no time in claiming that.”</p>
<p>“It must not be rendered here, but in Kirkwall.—We
must invoke, to witness the engagement, the
Spirit which presides over the ancient Circle of Stennis.
But perhaps you fear to name the ancient Father of
the Slain too, the Severe, the Terrible?”</p>
<p>Cleveland smiled.</p>
<p>“Do me the justice to think, lovely Minna, that
I am little subject to fear real causes of terror; and
for those which are visionary, I have no sympathy
whatever.”</p>
<p>“You believe not in them, then?” said Minna,
“and are so far better suited to be Brenda’s lover
than mine.”</p>
<p>“I will believe,” replied Cleveland, “in whatever
you believe. The whole inhabitants of that Valhalla,
about which you converse so much with that
fiddling, rhyming fool, Claud Halcro—all these
shall become living and existing things to my credulity.
But, Minna, do not ask me to fear any of
them.”</p>
<p>“Fear! no—not to <i>fear</i> them, surely,” replied
the maiden; “for, not before Thor or Odin, when
they approached in the fulness of their terrors, did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the heroes of my dauntless race yield one foot in
retreat. Nor do I own them as Deities—a better
faith prevents so foul an error. But, in our own
conception, they are powerful spirits for good or
evil. And when you boast not to fear them, bethink
you that you defy an enemy of a kind you
have never yet encountered.”</p>
<p>“Not in these northern latitudes,” said the lover,
with a smile, “where hitherto I have seen but
angels; but I have faced, in my time, the demons
of the Equinoctial Line, which we rovers suppose
to be as powerful, and as malignant, as those of the
North.”</p>
<p>“Have you, then, witnessed those wonders that
are beyond the visible world?” said Minna, with
some degree of awe.</p>
<p>Cleveland composed his countenance, and replied,—“A
short while before my father’s death, I came,
though then very young, into the command of a
sloop, manned with thirty as desperate fellows as
ever handled a musket. We cruized for a long while
with bad success, taking nothing but wretched small-craft,
which were destined to catch turtle, or otherwise
loaded with coarse and worthless trumpery. I
had much ado to prevent my comrades from avenging
upon the crews of those baubling shallops the
disappointment which they had occasioned to us. At
length, we grew desperate, and made a descent on
a village, where we were told we should intercept
the mules of a certain Spanish governor, laden with
treasure. We succeeded in carrying the place; but
while I endeavoured to save the inhabitants from
the fury of my followers, the muleteers, with their
precious cargo, escaped into the neighbouring woods.
This filled up the measure of my unpopularity. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
people, who had been long discontented, became
openly mutinous. I was deposed from my command
in solemn council, and condemned, as having
too little luck and too much humanity for the profession
I had undertaken, to be marooned,<a id="FNanchor2_10_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_10_11">[10]</a> as the
phrase goes, on one of those little sandy, bushy
islets, which are called, in the West Indies, keys,
and which are frequented only by turtle and by sea-fowl.
Many of them are supposed to be haunted<a id="FNanchor2_B_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_B_12">(<i>b</i>)</a>—some
by the demons worshipped by the old inhabitants—some
by Caciques and others, whom the
Spaniards had put to death by torture, to compel
them to discover their hidden treasures, and others
by the various spectres in which sailors of all nations
have implicit faith.<a id="FNanchor2_11_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_11_13">[11]</a> My place of banishment, called
Coffin-key, about two leagues and a half to the south-east
of Bermudas, was so infamous as the resort of
these supernatural inhabitants, that I believe the
wealth of Mexico would not have persuaded the
bravest of the scoundrels who put me ashore there,
to have spent an hour on the islet alone, even in
broad daylight; and when they rowed off, they
pulled for the sloop like men that dared not cast
their eyes behind them. And there they left me, to
subsist as I might, on a speck of unproductive sand,
surrounded by the boundless Atlantic, and haunted,
as they supposed, by malignant demons.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“And what was the consequence?” said Minna,
eagerly.</p>
<p>“I supported life,” said the adventurer, “at the
expense of such sea-fowl, aptly called boobies, as
were silly enough to let me approach so near as to
knock them down with a stick; and by means of
turtle-eggs, when these complaisant birds became
better acquainted with the mischievous disposition
of the human species, and more shy of course of my
advances.”</p>
<p>“And the demons of whom you spoke?”—continued
Minna.</p>
<p>“I had my secret apprehensions upon their account,”
said Cleveland: “In open daylight, or in
absolute darkness, I did not greatly apprehend their
approach; but in the misty dawn of the morning,
or when evening was about to fall, I saw, for the
first week of my abode on the key, many a dim and
undefined spectre, now resembling a Spaniard, with
his capa wrapped around him, and his huge sombrero,
as large as an umbrella, upon his head,—now
a Dutch sailor, with his rough cap and trunk-hose,—and
now an Indian Cacique, with his feathery
crown and long lance of cane.”</p>
<p>“Did you not approach and address them?” said
Minna.</p>
<p>“I always approached them,” replied the seaman;
“but,—I grieve to disappoint your expectations,
my fair friend,—whenever I drew near them, the
phantom changed into a bush, or a piece of drift-wood,
or a wreath of mist, or some such cause of
deception, until at last I was taught by experience
to cheat myself no longer with such visions, and
continued a solitary inhabitant of Coffin-key, as
little alarmed by visionary terrors, as I ever was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in the great cabin of a stout vessel, with a score of
companions around me.”</p>
<p>“You have cheated me into listening to a tale
of nothing,” said Minna; “but how long did you
continue on the island?”</p>
<p>“Four weeks of wretched existence,” said Cleveland,
“when I was relieved by the crew of a vessel
which came thither a-turtling. Yet my miserable
seclusion was not entirely useless to me; for on
that spot of barren sand I found, or rather forged,
the iron mask, which has since been my chief
security against treason, or mutiny of my followers.
It was there I formed the resolution to seem no
softer hearted, nor better instructed—no more
humane, and no more scrupulous, than those with
whom fortune had leagued me. I thought over my
former story, and saw that seeming more brave,
skilful, and enterprising than others, had gained
me command and respect, and that seeming more
gently nurtured, and more civilized than they, had
made them envy and hate me as a being of another
species. I bargained with myself, then, that since
I could not lay aside my superiority of intellect and
education, I would do my best to disguise, and to
sink in the rude seaman, all appearance of better
feeling and better accomplishments. I foresaw then
what has since happened, that, under the appearance
of daring obduracy, I should acquire such a
habitual command over my followers, that I might
use it for the insurance of discipline, and for relieving
the distresses of the wretches who fell under
our power. I saw, in short, that to attain authority,
I must assume the external semblance, at least,
of those over whom it was to be exercised. The
tidings of my father’s fate, while it excited me to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
wrath and to revenge, confirmed the resolution I
had adopted. He also had fallen a victim to his
superiority of mind, morals, and manners, above
those whom he commanded. They were wont to
call him the Gentleman; and, unquestionably, they
thought he waited some favourable opportunity to
reconcile himself, perhaps at their expense, to those
existing forms of society his habits seemed best to
suit with, and, even therefore, they murdered him.
Nature and justice alike called on me for revenge.
I was soon at the head of a new body of the adventurers,
who are so numerous in those islands. I
sought not after those by whom I had been myself
marooned, but after the wretches who had betrayed
my father; and on them I took a revenge so severe,
that it was of itself sufficient to stamp me with
the character of that inexorable ferocity which I
was desirous to be thought to possess, and which,
perhaps, was gradually creeping on my natural disposition
in actual earnest. My manner, speech, and
conduct, seemed so totally changed, that those who
formerly knew me were disposed to ascribe the alteration
to my intercourse with the demons who
haunted the sands of Coffin-key; nay, there were
some superstitious enough to believe, that I had
actually formed a league with them.”</p>
<p>“I tremble to hear the rest!” said Minna; “did
you not become the monster of courage and cruelty
whose character you assumed?”</p>
<p>“If I have escaped being so, it is to you, Minna,”
replied Cleveland, “that the wonder must be ascribed.
It is true, I have always endeavoured to
distinguish myself rather by acts of adventurous
valour, than by schemes of revenge or of plunder,
and that at length I could save lives by a rude jest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and sometimes, by the excess of the measures which
I myself proposed, could induce those under me to
intercede in favour of prisoners; so that the seeming
severity of my character has better served the
cause of humanity, than had I appeared directly
devoted to it.”</p>
<p>He ceased, and, as Minna replied not a word,
both remained silent for a little space, when Cleveland
again resumed the discourse:—</p>
<p>“You are silent,” he said, “Miss Troil, and I have
injured myself in your opinion by the frankness
with which I have laid my character before you. I
may truly say that my natural disposition has been
controlled, but not altered, by the untoward circumstances
in which I am placed.”</p>
<p>“I am uncertain,” said Minna, after a moment’s
consideration, “whether you had been thus candid,
had you not known I should soon see your comrades,
and discover, from their conversation and
their manners, what you would otherwise gladly
have concealed.”</p>
<p>“You do me injustice, Minna, cruel injustice.
From the instant that you knew me to be a sailor
of fortune, an adventurer, a buccanier, or, if you
will have the broad word, a <small>PIRATE</small>, what had you
to expect less than what I have told you?”</p>
<p>“You speak too truly,” said Minna—“all this
I might have anticipated, and I know not how I
should have expected it otherwise. But it seemed
to me that a war on the cruel and superstitious
Spaniards had in it something ennobling—something
that refined the fierce employment to which
you have just now given its true and dreaded name.
I thought that the independent warriors of the
Western Ocean, raised up, as it were, to punish the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
wrongs of so many murdered and plundered tribes
must have had something of gallant elevation, like
that of the Sons of the North, whose long galleys
avenged on so many coasts the oppressions of degenerate
Rome. This I thought, and this I dreamed—I
grieve that I am awakened and undeceived. Yet
I blame you not for the erring of my own fancy.—Farewell;
we must now part.”</p>
<p>“Say at least,” said Cleveland, “that you do not
hold me in horror for having told you the truth.”</p>
<p>“I must have time for reflection,” said Minna,
“time to weigh what you have said, ere I can fully
understand my own feelings. Thus much, however,
I can say even now, that he who pursues the wicked
purpose of plunder, by means of blood and cruelty,
and who must veil his remains of natural remorse
under an affectation of superior profligacy, is not, and
cannot be, the lover whom Minna Troil expected to
find in Cleveland; and if she still love him, it must
be as a penitent, and not as a hero.”</p>
<p>So saying, she extricated herself from his grasp,
(for he still endeavoured to detain her,) making an
imperative sign to him to forbear from following
her.—“She is gone,” said Cleveland, looking after
her; “wild and fanciful as she is, I expected not
this.—She startled not at the name of my perilous
course of life, yet seems totally unprepared for the
evil which must necessarily attend it; and so all the
merit I have gained by my resemblance to a Norse
Champion, or King of the Sea, is to be lost at once,
because a gang of pirates do not prove to be a choir
of saints. I would that Rackam, Hawkins, and the
rest, had been at the bottom of the Race of Portland—I
would the Pentland Frith had swept them
to hell rather than to Orkney! I will not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
quit the chase of this angel for all that these fiends
can do. I will—I must to Orkney before the Udaller
makes his voyage thither—our meeting might
alarm even his blunt understanding, although, thank
Heaven, in this wild country, men know the nature
of our trade only by hearsay, through our honest
friends the Dutch, who take care never to speak
very ill of those they make money by.—Well, if
fortune would but stand my friend with this beautiful
enthusiast, I would pursue her wheel no farther
at sea, but set myself down amongst these
rocks, as happy as if they were so many groves of
bananas and palmettoes.”</p>
<p>With these, and such thoughts, half rolling in his
bosom, half expressed in indistinct hints and murmurs,
the pirate Cleveland returned to the mansion
of Burgh-Westra.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote2_8_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_8_9" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Dr. Edmonston, the ingenious author of a View of the Ancient
and Present State of the Zetland Islands, has placed this part of
the subject in an interesting light. “It is truly painful to witness
the anxiety and distress which the wives of these poor men
suffer on the approach of a storm. Regardless of fatigue, they
leave their homes, and fly to the spot where they expect their husbands
to land, or ascend the summit of a rock, to look out for them
on the bosom of the deep. Should they get the glimpse of a sail,
they watch, with trembling solicitude, its alternate rise and disappearance
on the waves; and though often tranquillized by the
safe arrival of the objects of their search, yet it sometimes is their lot
‘to hail the bark that never can return.’ Subject to the influence
of a variable climate, and engaged on a sea naturally tempestuous,
with rapid currents, scarcely a season passes over without the occurrence
of some fatal accident or hairbreadth escape.”—<i>View,
&amp;c. of the Zetland Islands</i>, vol. i. p. 238. Many interesting particulars
respecting the fisheries and agriculture of Zetland, as well
as its antiquities, may be found in the work we have quoted.</p></div>

<p>We do not dwell upon the festivities of the day,
which had nothing in them to interest the reader
particularly. The table groaned under the usual
plenty, which was disposed of by the guests with
the usual appetite—the bowl of punch was filled and
emptied with the same celerity as usual—the men
quaffed, and the women laughed—Claud Halcro
rhymed, punned, and praised John Dryden—the
Udaller bumpered and sung choruses—and the
evening concluded, as usual, in the Rigging-loft, as
it was Magnus Troil’s pleasure to term the dancing
apartment.</p>
<p>It was then and there that Cleveland, approaching
Magnus, where he sat betwixt his two daughters,
intimated his intention of going to Kirkwall
in a small brig, which Bryce Snailsfoot, who had
disposed of his goods with unprecedented celerity,
had freighted thither, to procure a supply.</p>
<p>Magnus heard the sudden proposal of his guest
with surprise, not unmingled with displeasure, and
demanded sharply of Cleveland, how long it was
since he had learned to prefer Bryce Snailsfoot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>’s
company to his own? Cleveland answered, with
his usual bluntness of manner, that time and tide
tarried for no one, and that he had his own particular
reasons for making his trip to Kirkwall sooner
than the Udaller proposed to set sail—that he
hoped to meet with him and his daughters at the
great fair which was now closely approaching, and
might perhaps find it possible to return to Zetland
along with them.</p>
<p>While he spoke this, Brenda kept her eye as
much upon her sister as it was possible to do, without
exciting general observation. She remarked,
that Minna’s pale cheek became yet paler while
Cleveland spoke, and that she seemed, by compressing
her lips, and slightly knitting her brows,
to be in the act of repressing the effects of strong
interior emotion. But she spoke not; and when
Cleveland, having bidden adieu to the Udaller, approached
to salute her, as was then the custom,
she received his farewell without trusting herself to
attempt a reply.</p>
<p>Brenda had her own trial approaching; for Mordaunt
Mertoun, once so much loved by her father,
was now in the act of making his cold parting from
him, without receiving a single look of friendly regard.
There was, indeed, sarcasm in the tone with
which Magnus wished the youth a good journey,
and recommended to him, if he met a bonny lass
by the way, not to dream that she was in love, because
she chanced to jest with him. Mertoun coloured
at what he felt as an insult, though it was
but half intelligible to him; but he remembered
Brenda, and suppressed every feeling of resentment.
He proceeded to take his leave of the sisters. Minna,
whose heart was considerably softened towards him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
received his farewell with some degree of interest;
but Brenda’s grief was so visible in the kindness
of her manner, and the moisture which gathered
in her eye, that it was noticed even by the Udaller,
who exclaimed, half angrily, “Why, ay, lass,
that may be right enough, for he was an old acquaintance;
but mind! I have no will that he
remain one.”</p>
<p>Mertoun, who was slowly leaving the apartment,
half overheard this disparaging observation, and half
turned round to resent it. But his purpose failed
him when he saw that Brenda had been obliged to
have recourse to her handkerchief to hide her emotion,
and the sense that it was excited by his departure,
obliterated every thought of her father’s
unkindness. He retired—the other guests followed
his example; and many of them, like Cleveland
and himself, took their leave over-night, with the
intention of commencing their homeward journey
on the succeeding morning.</p>
<p>That night, the mutual sorrow of Minna and
Brenda, if it could not wholly remove the reserve
which had estranged the sisters from each other, at
least melted all its frozen and unkindly symptoms.
They wept in each other’s arms; and though neither
spoke, yet each became dearer to the other; because
they felt that the grief which called forth these
drops, had a source common to them both.</p>
<p>It is probable, that though Brenda’s tears were
most abundant, the grief of Minna was most deeply
seated; for, long after the younger had sobbed
herself asleep, like a child, upon her sister’s bosom,
Minna lay awake, watching the dubious twilight,
while tear after tear slowly gathered in her eye,
and found a current down her cheek, as soon as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
became too heavy to be supported by her long black
silken eyelashes. As she lay, bewildered among
the sorrowful thoughts which supplied these tears,
she was surprised to distinguish, beneath the window,
the sounds of music. At first she supposed
it was some freak of Claud Halcro, whose fantastic
humour sometimes indulged itself in such serenades.
But it was not the <i>gue</i> of the old minstrel, but the
guitar, that she heard; an instrument which none
in the island knew how to touch except Cleveland,
who had learned, in his intercourse with the South-American
Spaniards, to play on it with superior
execution. Perhaps it was in those climates also
that he had learned the song, which, though he now
sung it under the window of a maiden of Thule,
had certainly never been composed for the native
of a climate so northerly and so severe, since it
spoke of productions of the earth and skies which
are there unknown.</p>

</p>
<p>The voice of Cleveland was deep, rich, and manly,
and accorded well with the Spanish air, to which
the words, probably a translation from the same
language, had been adapted. His invocation would
not probably have been fruitless, could Minna have
arisen without awaking her sister. But that was impossible;
for Brenda, who, as we have already mentioned,
had wept bitterly before she had sunk into
repose, now lay with her face on her sister’s neck,
and one arm stretched around her, in the attitude
of a child which has cried itself asleep in the arms
of its nurse. It was impossible for Minna to extricate
herself from her grasp without awaking her;
and she could not, therefore, execute her hasty purpose,
of donning her gown, and approaching the
window to speak with Cleveland, who, she had no
doubt, had resorted to this contrivance to procure
an interview. The restraint was sufficiently provoking,
for it was more than probable that her lover
came to take his last farewell; but that Brenda,
inimical as she seemed to be of late towards Cleveland,
should awake and witness it, was a thought
not to be endured.</p>
<p>There was a short pause, in which Minna endeavoured
more than once, with as much gentleness
as possible, to unclasp Brenda’s arm from her neck;
but whenever she attempted it, the slumberer
muttered some little pettish sound, like a child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
disturbed in its sleep, which sufficiently showed
that perseverance in the attempt would awaken
her fully.</p>
<p>To her great vexation, therefore, Minna was compelled
to remain still and silent; when her lover, as
if determined upon gaining her ear by music of
another strain, sung the following fragment of a
sea-ditty:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Farewell! Farewell! the voice you hear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has left its last soft tone with you,—</span><br>
Its next must join the seaward cheer,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shout among the shouting crew.</span><br>
<br>
“The accents which I scarce could form<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath your frown’s controlling check,</span><br>
Must give the word, above the storm,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cut the mast, and clear the wreck.</span><br>
<br>
“The timid eye I dared not raise,—<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hand that shook when press’d to thine,</span><br>
Must point the guns upon the chase,—<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must bid the deadly cutlass shine.</span><br>
<br>
“To all I love, or hope, or fear,—<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Honour, or own, a long adieu!</span><br>
To all that life has soft and dear,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewell! save memory of you!”<a id="FNanchor2_12_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_12_14">[12]</a><a id="FNanchor2_C_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_C_15">(<i>c</i>)</a></span><br>
</p>
<p>He was again silent; and again she, to whom the
serenade was addressed, strove in vain to arise without
rousing her sister. It was impossible; and she
had nothing before her but the unhappy thought
that Cleveland was taking leave in his desolation,
without a single glance, or a single word. He, too,
whose temper was so fiery, yet who subjected his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
violent mood with such sedulous attention to her
will—could she but have stolen a moment to say
adieu—to caution him against new quarrels with
Mertoun—to implore him to detach himself from
such comrades as he had described—could she but
have done this, who could say what effect such parting
admonitions might have had upon his character—nay,
upon the future events of his life?</p>
<p>Tantalized by such thoughts, Minna was about to
make another and decisive effort, when she heard
voices beneath the window, and thought she could
distinguish that they were those of Cleveland and
Mertoun, speaking in a sharp tone, which, at the same
time, seemed cautiously suppressed, as if the speakers
feared being overheard. Alarm now mingled
with her former desire to rise from bed, and she
accomplished at once the purpose which she had
so often attempted in vain. Brenda’s arm was unloosed
from her sister’s neck, without the sleeper
receiving more alarm than provoked two or three
unintelligible murmurs; while, with equal speed
and silence, Minna put on some part of her dress,
with the intention to steal to the window. But,
ere she could accomplish this, the sound of the
voices without was exchanged for that of blows
and struggling, which terminated suddenly by a
deep groan.</p>
<p>Terrified at this last signal of mischief, Minna
sprung to the window, and endeavoured to open it,
for the persons were so close under the walls of the
house that she could not see them, save by putting
her head out of the casement. The iron hasp was
stiff and rusted, and, as generally happens, the haste
with which she laboured to undo it only rendered
the task more difficult. When it was accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and Minna had eagerly thrust her body half out at
the casement, those who had created the sounds
which alarmed her were become invisible, excepting
that she saw a shadow cross the moonlight, the
substance of which must have been in the act of
turning a corner, which concealed it from her sight.
The shadow moved slowly, and seemed that of a
man who supported another upon his shoulders; an
indication which put the climax to Minna’s agony
of mind. The window was not above eight feet
from the ground, and she hesitated not to throw
herself from it hastily, and to pursue the object
which had excited her terror.</p>
<p>But when she came to the corner of the buildings
from which the shadow seemed to have been projected,
she discovered nothing which could point out
the way that the figure had gone; and, after a moment’s
consideration, became sensible that all attempts
at pursuit would be alike wild and fruitless.
Besides all the projections and recesses of the many-angled
mansion, and its numerous offices—besides
the various cellars, store-houses, stables, and so forth,
which defied her solitary search, there was a range
of low rocks, stretching down to the haven, and
which were, in fact, a continuation of the ridge
which formed its pier. These rocks had many indentures,
hollows, and caverns, into any one of
which the figure to which the shadow belonged
might have retired with his fatal burden; for fatal,
she feared, it was most likely to prove.</p>
<p>A moment’s reflection, as we have said, convinced
Minna of the folly of further pursuit. Her next
thought was to alarm the family; but what tale had
she to tell, and of whom was that tale to be told?—On
the other hand, the wounded man—if indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
he were wounded—alas, if indeed he were not
mortally wounded!—might not be past the reach
of assistance; and, with this idea, she was about
to raise her voice, when she was interrupted by that
of Claud Halcro, who was returning apparently from
the haven, and singing, in his manner, a scrap of an
old Norse ditty, which might run thus in English:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“And you shall deal the funeral dole;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ay, deal it, mother mine,</span><br>
To weary body, and to heavy soul,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white bread and the wine.</span><br>
<br>
“And you shall deal my horses of pride;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ay, deal them, mother mine;</span><br>
And you shall deal my lands so wide,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deal my castles nine.</span><br>
<br>
“But deal not vengeance for the deed,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deal not for the crime;</span><br>
The body to its place, and the soul to Heaven’s grace,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the rest in God’s own time.”</span><br>
</p>
<p>The singular adaptation of these rhymes to the
situation in which she found herself, seemed to
Minna like a warning from Heaven. We are speaking
of a land of omens and superstitions, and perhaps
will scarce be understood by those whose limited
imagination cannot conceive how strongly these
operate upon the human mind during a certain
progress of society. A line of Virgil, turned up
casually, was received in the seventeenth century,
and in the court of England,<a id="FNanchor2_13_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_13_16">[13]</a> as an intimation of
future events; and no wonder that a maiden of the
distant and wild isles of Zetland should have considered
as an injunction from Heaven, verses which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
happened to convey a sense analogous to her present
situation.</p>
<p>“I will be silent,” she muttered,—“I will seal
my lips—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘The body to its place, and the soul to Heaven’s grace,<br>
    And the rest in God’s own time.’”<br>
</p>
<p>“Who speaks there?” said Claud Halcro, in some
alarm; for he had not, in his travels in foreign parts,
been able by any means to rid himself of his native
superstitions. In the condition to which fear and
horror had reduced her, Minna was at first unable to
reply; and Halcro, fixing his eyes upon the female
white figure, which he saw indistinctly, (for she stood
in the shadow of the house, and the morning was
thick and misty,) began to conjure her in an ancient
rhyme which occurred to him as suited for the occasion,
and which had in its gibberish a wild and
unearthly sound, which may be lost in the ensuing
translation:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Saint Magnus control thee, that martyr of treason;<br>
Saint Ronan rebuke thee, with rhyme and with reason;<br>
By the mass of Saint Martin, the might of Saint Mary,<br>
Be thou gone, or thy weird shall be worse if thou tarry!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If of good, go hence and hallow thee,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If of ill, let the earth swallow thee,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thou’rt of air, let the grey mist fold thee,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If of earth, let the swart mine hold thee,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If a Pixie, seek thy ring,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If a Nixie, seek thy spring;—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If on middle earth thou’st been</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slave of sorrow, shame, and sin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hast eat the bread of toil and strife,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dree’d the lot which men call life,</span><br>
Begone to thy stone! for thy coffin is scant of thee,<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>The worm, thy playfellow, wails for the want of thee;—<br>
Hence, houseless ghost! let the earth hide thee,<br>
Till Michael shall blow the blast, see that there thou bide thee!—<br>
Phantom, fly hence! take the Cross for a token,<br>
Hence pass till Hallowmass!—my spell is spoken.”<br>
</p>
<p>“It is I, Halcro,” muttered Minna, in a tone so
thin and low, that it might have passed for the faint
reply of the conjured phantom.</p>
<p>“You!—you!” said Halcro, his tone of alarm
changing to one of extreme surprise; “by this
moonlight, which is waning, and so it is!—Who
could have thought to find you, my most lovely
Night, wandering abroad in your own element!—But
you saw them, I reckon, as well as I?—bold
enough in you to follow them, though.”</p>
<p>“Saw whom?—follow whom?” said Minna,
hoping to gain some information on the subject of
her fears and anxiety.</p>
<p>“The corpse-lights which danced at the haven,”
replied Halcro; “they bode no good, I promise
you—you wot well what the old rhyme says—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘Where corpse-light<br>
Dances bright,<br>
Be it day or night,<br>
Be it by light or dark,<br>
There shall corpse lie stiff and stark.’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">I went half as far as the haven to look after them,
but they had vanished. I think I saw a boat put
off, however,—some one bound for the Haaf, I suppose.—I
would we had good news of this fishing—there
was Norna left us in anger,—and then these
corpse-lights!—Well, God help the while! I am an
old man, and can but wish that all were well over.—But
how now, my pretty Minna? tears in your eyes!—And
now that I see you in the fair moonlight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
barefooted, too, by Saint Magnus!—Were there no
stockings of Zetland wool soft enough for these
pretty feet and ankles, that glance so white in the
moonbeam?—What, silent!—angry, perhaps,” he
added, in a more serious tone, “at my nonsense?
For shame, silly maiden!—Remember I am old
enough to be your father, and have always loved
you as my child.”</p>
<p>“I am not angry,” said Minna, constraining herself
to speak—“but heard you nothing?—saw you
nothing?—They must have passed you.”</p>
<p>“They?” said Claud Halcro; “what mean you
by they?—is it the corpse-lights?—No, they did
not pass by me, but I think they have passed by
you, and blighted you with their influence, for you
are as pale as a spectre.—Come, come, Minna,” he
added, opening a side-door of the dwelling, “these
moonlight walks are fitter for old poets than for
young maidens—And so lightly clad as you are!
Maiden, you should take care how you give yourself
to the breezes of a Zetland night, for they bring
more sleet than odours upon their wings.—But,
maiden, go in; for, as glorious John says—or, as he
does not say—for I cannot remember how his verse
chimes—but, as I say myself, in a pretty poem,
written when my muse was in her teens,—</p>
<p class="poem">
Menseful maiden ne’er should rise,<br>
Till the first beam tinge the skies;<br>
Silk-fringed eyelids still should close,<br>
Till the sun has kiss’d the rose;<br>
Maiden’s foot we should not view,<br>
Mark’d with tiny print on dew,<br>
Till the opening flowerets spread<br>
Carpet meet for beauty’s tread—<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">Stay, what comes next?—let me see.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>”</p>
<p>When the spirit of recitation seized on Claud
Halcro, he forgot time and place, and might have
kept his companion in the cold air for half an hour,
giving poetical reasons why she ought to have been
in bed. But she interrupted him by the question,
earnestly pronounced, yet in a voice which was
scarcely articulate, holding Halcro, at the same
time, with a trembling and convulsive grasp, as if
to support herself from falling,—“Saw you no one
in the boat which put to sea but now?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” replied Halcro; “how could I see
any one, when light and distance only enabled me
to know that it was a boat, and not a grampus?”</p>
<p>“But there must have been some one in the
boat?” repeated Minna, scarce conscious of what
she said.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” answered the poet; “boats seldom
work to windward of their own accord.—But come,
this is all folly; and so, as the Queen says, in an old
play, which was revived for the stage by rare Will
D’Avenant, ‘To bed—to bed—to bed!’”</p>
<p>They separated, and Minna’s limbs conveyed her
with difficulty, through several devious passages, to
her own chamber, where she stretched herself cautiously
beside her still sleeping sister, with a mind
harassed with the most agonizing apprehensions.
That she had heard Cleveland, she was positive—the
tenor of the songs left her no doubt on that subject.
If not equally certain that she had heard
young Mertoun’s voice in hot quarrel with her lover,
the impression to that effect was strong on her
mind. The groan, with which the struggle seemed
to terminate—the fearful indication from which it
seemed that the conqueror had borne off the lifeless
body of his victim—all tended to prove that some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
fatal event had concluded the contest. And which
of the unhappy men had fallen?—which had met
a bloody death?—which had achieved a fatal and
a bloody victory?—These were questions to which
the still small voice of interior conviction answered,
that her lover Cleveland, from character, temper,
and habits, was most likely to have been the survivor
of the fray. She received from the reflection
an involuntary consolation which she almost detested
herself for admitting, when she recollected
that it was at once darkened with her lover’s guilt,
and embittered with the destruction of Brenda’s
happiness for ever.</p>
<p>“Innocent, unhappy sister!” such were her reflections;
“thou that art ten times better than I,
because so unpretending—so unassuming in thine
excellence! How is it possible that I should cease
to feel a pang, which is only transferred from my
bosom to thine?”</p>
<p>As these cruel thoughts crossed her mind, she
could not refrain from straining her sister so close
to her bosom, that, after a heavy sigh, Brenda
awoke.</p>
<p>“Sister,” she said, “is it you?—I dreamed I lay
on one of those monuments which Claud Halcro
described to us, where the effigy of the inhabitant
beneath lies carved in stone upon the sepulchre. I
dreamed such a marble form lay by my side, and
that it suddenly acquired enough of life and animation
to fold me to its cold, moist bosom—and it is
yours, Minna, that is indeed so chilly.—You are ill,
my dearest Minna! for God’s sake, let me rise and
call Euphane Fea.—What ails you? has Norna
been here again?”</p>
<p>“Call no one hither,” said Minna, detaining her;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
“nothing ails me for which any one has a remedy—nothing
but apprehensions of evil worse than
even Norna could prophesy. But God is above all,
my dear Brenda; and let us pray to him to turn,
as he only can, our evil into good.”</p>
<p>They did jointly repeat their usual prayer for
strength and protection from on high, and again
composed themselves to sleep, suffering no word
save “God bless you,” to pass betwixt them, when
their devotions were finished; thus scrupulously
dedicating to Heaven their last waking words, if
human frailty prevented them from commanding
their last waking thoughts. Brenda slept first, and
Minna, strongly resisting the dark and evil presentiments
which again began to crowd themselves
upon her imagination, was at last so fortunate as to
slumber also.</p>
<p>The storm which Halcro had expected began
about daybreak,—a squall, heavy with wind and
rain, such as is often felt, even during the finest part
of the season, in these latitudes. At the whistle of
the wind, and the clatter of the rain on the shingle-roofing
of the fishers’ huts, many a poor woman was
awakened, and called on her children to hold up
their little hands, and join in prayer for the safety
of the dear husband and father, who was even then
at the mercy of the disturbed elements. Around
the house of Burgh-Westra, chimneys howled, and
windows clashed. The props and rafters of the
higher parts of the building, most of them formed
out of wreck-wood, groaned and quivered, as fearing
to be again dispersed by the tempest. But the
daughters of Magnus Troil continued to sleep as
softly and as sweetly as if the hand of Chantrey had
formed them out of statuary-marble. The squall had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
passed away, and the sunbeams, dispersing the clouds
which drifted to leeward, shone full through the
lattice, when Minna first started from the profound
sleep into which fatigue and mental exhaustion had
lulled her, and, raising herself on her arm, began to
recall events, which, after this interval of profound
repose, seemed almost to resemble the baseless
visions of the night. She almost doubted if what
she recalled of horror, previous to her starting from
her bed, was not indeed the fiction of a dream, suggested,
perhaps, by some external sounds.</p>
<p>“I will see Claud Halcro instantly,” she said;
“he may know something of these strange noises,
as he was stirring at the time.”</p>
<p>With that she sprung from bed, but hardly stood
upright on the floor, ere her sister exclaimed,
“Gracious Heaven! Minna, what ails your foot—your
ankle?”</p>
<p>She looked down, and saw with surprise, which
amounted to agony, that both her feet, but particularly
one of them, was stained with dark crimson,
resembling the colour of dried blood.</p>
<p>Without attempting to answer Brenda, she
rushed to the window, and cast a desperate look on
the grass beneath, for there she knew she must have
contracted the fatal stain. But the rain, which had
fallen there in treble quantity, as well from the
heavens, as from the eaves of the house, had washed
away that guilty witness, if indeed such had ever
existed. All was fresh and fair, and the blades
of grass, overcharged and bent with rain-drops, glittered
like diamonds in the bright morning sun.</p>
<p>While Minna stared upon the spangled verdure,
with her full dark eyes fixed and enlarged to circles
by the intensity of her terror, Brenda was hanging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
about her, and with many an eager enquiry, pressed
to know whether or how she had hurt herself?</p>
<p>“A piece of glass cut through my shoe,” said
Minna, bethinking herself that some excuse was
necessary to her sister; “I scarce felt it at the
time.”</p>
<p>“And yet see how it has bled,” said her sister.
“Sweet Minna,” she added, approaching her with
a wetted towel, “let me wipe the blood off—the
hurt may be worse than you think of.”</p>
<p>But as she approached, Minna, who saw no other
way of preventing discovery that the blood with
which she was stained had never flowed in her own
veins, harshly and hastily repelled the proffered
kindness. Poor Brenda, unconscious of any offence
which she had given to her sister, drew back two
or three paces on finding her service thus unkindly
refused, and stood gazing at Minna with looks
in which there was more of surprise and mortified
affection than of resentment, but which had yet
something also of natural displeasure.</p>
<p>“Sister,” said she, “I thought we had agreed but
last night, that, happen to us what might, we would
at least love each other.”</p>
<p>“Much may happen betwixt night and morning!”
answered Minna, in words rather wrenched from
her by her situation, than flowing forth the voluntary
interpreters of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Much may indeed have happened in a night so
stormy,” answered Brenda; “for see where the very
wall around Euphane’s plant-a-cruive has been
blown down; but neither wind nor rain, nor aught
else, can cool our affection, Minna.”</p>
<p>“But that may chance,” replied Minna, “which
may convert it into”—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>—</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence she muttered in a tone so
indistinct, that it could not be apprehended; while,
at the same time, she washed the blood-stains from
her feet and left ankle. Brenda, who still remained
looking on at some distance, endeavoured in vain to
assume some tone which might re-establish kindness
and confidence betwixt them.</p>
<p>“You were right,” she said, “Minna, to suffer no
one to help you to dress so simple a scratch—standing
where I do, it is scarce visible.”</p>
<p>“The most cruel wounds,” replied Minna, “are
those which make no outward show—Are you sure
you see it at all?”</p>
<p>“O, yes!” replied Brenda, framing her answer as
she thought would best please her sister; “I see a
very slight scratch; nay, now you draw on the
stocking, I can see nothing.”</p>
<p>“You do indeed see nothing,” answered Minna,
somewhat wildly; “but the time will soon come
that all—ay, all—will be seen and known.”</p>
<p>So saying, she hastily completed her dress, and
led the way to breakfast, where she assumed her
place amongst the guests; but with a countenance
so pale and haggard, and manners and speech so
altered and so bewildered, that it excited the attention
of the whole company, and the utmost anxiety
on the part of her father Magnus Troil. Many and
various were the conjectures of the guests, concerning
a distemperature which seemed rather mental
than corporeal. Some hinted that the maiden had
been struck with an evil eye, and something they
muttered about Norna of the Fitful-head; some
talked of the departure of Captain Cleveland, and
murmured, “it was a shame for a young lady to
take on so after a landlouper, of whom no one knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
any thing;” and this contemptuous epithet was in
particular bestowed on the Captain by Mistress
Baby Yellowley, while she was in the act of wrapping
round her old skinny neck the very handsome
owerlay (as she called it) wherewith the said Captain
had presented her. The old Lady Glowrowrum
had a system of her own, which she hinted to Mistress
Yellowley, after thanking God that her own
connexion with the Burgh-Westra family was by
the lass’s mother, who was a canny Scotswoman,
like herself.</p>
<p>“For, as to these Troils, you see, Dame Yellowley,
for as high as they hold their heads, they say
that ken,” (winking sagaciously,) “that there is a
bee in their bonnet;—that Norna, as they call her,
for it’s not her right name neither, is at whiles far
beside her right mind,—and they that ken the
cause, say the Fowd was some gate or other
linked in with it, for he will never hear an ill word
of her. But I was in Scotland then, or I might have
kend the real cause, as weel as other folk. At ony
rate there is a kind of wildness in the blood. Ye
ken very weel daft folk dinna bide to be contradicted;
and I’ll say that for the Fowd—he likes to
be contradicted as ill as ony man in Zetland. But
it shall never be said that I said ony ill of the house
that I am sae nearly connected wi’. Only ye will
mind, dame, it is through the Sinclairs that we are
akin, not through the Troils,—and the Sinclairs are
kend far and wide for a wise generation, dame.—But
I see there is the stirrup-cup coming round.”</p>
<p>“I wonder,” said Mistress Baby to her brother, as
soon as the Lady Glowrowrum turned from her,
“what gars that muckle wife dame, dame, dame,
that gate at me? She might ken the blude of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Clinkscales is as gude as ony Glowrowrum’s amang
them.”</p>
<p>The guests, meanwhile, were fast taking their departure,
scarcely noticed by Magnus, who was so
much engrossed with Minna’s indisposition, that,
contrary to his hospitable wont, he suffered them to
go away unsaluted. And thus concluded, amidst
anxiety and illness, the festival of Saint John, as
celebrated on that season at the house of Burgh-Westra;
adding another caution to that of the
Emperor of Ethiopia,—with how little security
man can reckon upon the days which he destines to
happiness.</p>

</p>
<p>The term had now elapsed, by several days, when
Mordaunt Mertoun, as he had promised at his departure,
should have returned to his father’s abode
at Jarlshof, but there were no tidings of his arrival.
Such delay might, at another time, have excited
little curiosity, and no anxiety; for old Swertha,
who took upon her the office of thinking and conjecturing
for the little household, would have concluded
that he had remained behind the other
guests upon some party of sport or pleasure. But
she knew that Mordaunt had not been lately in
favour with Magnus Troil; she knew that he proposed
his stay at Burgh-Westra should be a short
one, upon account of his father’s health, to whom,
notwithstanding the little encouragement which his
filial piety received, he paid uniform attention.
Swertha knew all this, and she became anxious.
She watched the looks of her master, the elder Mertoun;
but, wrapt in dark and stern uniformity of
composure, his countenance, like the surface of a
midnight lake, enabled no one to penetrate into
what was beneath. His studies, his solitary meals,
his lonely walks, succeeded each other in unvaried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
rotation, and seemed undisturbed by the least
thought about Mordaunt’s absence.</p>
<p>At length such reports reached Swertha’s ear,
from various quarters, that she became totally unable
to conceal her anxiety, and resolved, at the risk
of provoking her master into fury, or perhaps that
of losing her place in his household, to force upon
his notice the doubts which afflicted her own mind.
Mordaunt’s good-humour and goodly person must
indeed have made no small impression on the withered
and selfish heart of the poor old woman, to induce
her to take a course so desperate, and from
which her friend the Ranzelman endeavoured in
vain to deter her. Still, however, conscious that a
miscarriage in the matter, would, like the loss of
Trinculo’s bottle in the horse-pool, be attended not
only with dishonour, but with infinite loss, she determined
to proceed on her high emprize with as
much caution as was consistent with the attempt.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned, that it seemed a part
of the very nature of this reserved and unsocial
being, at least since his retreat into the utter solitude
of Jarlshof, to endure no one to start a subject of
conversation, or to put any question to him, that did
not arise out of urgent and pressing emergency.
Swertha was sensible, therefore, that, in order to
open the discourse favourably which she proposed
to hold with her master, she must contrive that it
should originate with himself.</p>
<p>To accomplish this purpose, while busied in preparing
the table for Mr. Mertoun’s simple and solitary
dinner-meal, she formally adorned the table
with two covers instead of one, and made all her
other preparations as if he was to have a guest or
companion at dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>The artifice succeeded; for Mertoun, on coming
from his study, no sooner saw the table thus arranged,
than he asked Swertha, who, waiting the
effect of her stratagem as a fisher watches his
ground-baits, was fiddling up and down the room,
“Whether Mordaunt was returned from Burgh-Westra?”</p>
<p>This question was the cue for Swertha, and she
answered in a voice of sorrowful anxiety, half real,
half affected, “Na, na!—nae sic divot had dunted
at their door. It wad be blithe news indeed, to
ken that young Maister Mordaunt, puir dear bairn,
were safe at hame.”</p>
<p>“And if he be not at home, why should you lay
a cover for him, you doting fool?” replied Mertoun,
in a tone well calculated to stop the old woman’s
proceedings. But she replied, boldly, “that, indeed,
somebody should take thought about Maister Mordaunt;
a’ that she could do was to have seat and
plate ready for him when he came. But she thought
the dear bairn had been ower lang awa; and, if she
maun speak out, she had her ain fears when and
whether he might ever come hame.”</p>
<p>“<i>Your</i> fears!” said Mertoun, his eyes flashing
as they usually did when his hour of ungovernable
passion approached; “do you speak of your idle fears
to me, who know that all of your sex, that is not
fickleness, and folly, and self-conceit, and self-will,
is a bundle of idiotical fears, vapours, and tremors?
What are your fears to me, you foolish old hag?”</p>
<p>It is an admirable quality in womankind, that,
when a breach of the laws of natural affection comes
under their observation, the whole sex is in arms.
Let a rumour arise in the street of a parent that
has misused a child, or a child that has insulted a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
parent,—I say nothing of the case of husband and
wife, where the interest may be accounted for in
sympathy,—and all the women within hearing will
take animated and decided part with the sufferer.
Swertha, notwithstanding her greed and avarice,
had her share of the generous feeling which does
so much honour to her sex, and was, on this occasion,
so much carried on by its impulse, that she
confronted her master, and upbraided him with his
hard-hearted indifference, with a boldness at which
she herself was astonished.</p>
<p>“To be sure it wasna her that suld be fearing
for her young maister, Maister Mordaunt, even
although he was, as she might weel say, the very
sea-calf of her heart; but ony other father, but his
honour himsell, wad have had speerings made after
the poor lad, and him gane this eight-days from
Burgh-Westra, and naebody kend when or where
he had gane. There wasna a bairn in the howff
but was maining for him; for he made all their
bits of boats with his knife; there wadna be a dry
eye in the parish, if aught worse than weal should
befall him,—na, no ane, unless it might be his
honour’s ain.”</p>
<p>Mertoun had been much struck, and even silenced,
by the insolent volubility of his insurgent housekeeper;
but, at the last sarcasm, he imposed on her
silence in her turn with an audible voice, accompanied
with one of the most terrific glances which
his dark eye and stern features could express. But
Swertha, who, as she afterwards acquainted the
Ranzelman, was wonderfully supported during the
whole scene, would not be controlled by the loud
voice and ferocious look of her master, but proceeded
in the same tone as before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>“His honour,” she said, “had made an unco wark
because a wheen bits of kists and duds, that naebody
had use for, had been gathered on the beach
by the poor bodies of the township; and here was
the bravest lad in the country lost, and cast away,
as it were, before his een, and nae are asking what
was come o’ him.”</p>
<p>“What should come of him but good, you old
fool,” answered Mr. Mertoun, “as far, at least, as
there can be good in any of the follies he spends
his time in?”</p>
<p>This was spoken rather in a scornful than an
angry tone, and Swertha, who had got into the spirit
of the dialogue, was resolved not to let it drop, now
that the fire of her opponent seemed to slacken.</p>
<p>“O ay, to be sure I am an auld fule,—but if
Maister Mordaunt should have settled down in the
Roost, as mair than ae boat had been lost in that
wearifu’ squall the other morning—by good luck
it was short as it was sharp, or naething could have
lived in it—or if he were drowned in a loch coming
hame on foot, or if he were killed by miss of footing
on a craig—the haill island kend how venturesome
he was—who,” said Swertha, “will be the
auld fule then?” And she added a pathetic ejaculation,
that “God would protect the poor motherless
bairn! for if he had had a mother, there would
have been search made after him before now.”</p>
<p>This last sarcasm affected Mertoun powerfully,—his
jaw quivered, his face grew pale, and he muttered
to Swertha to go into his study, (where she
was scarcely ever permitted to enter,) and fetch
him a bottle which stood there.</p>
<p>“O ho!” quoth Swertha to herself, as she hastened
on the commission, “my master knows where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to find a cup of comfort to qualify his water with
upon fitting occasions.”</p>
<p>There was indeed a case of such bottles as were
usually employed to hold strong waters, but the
dust and cobwebs in which they were enveloped
showed that they had not been touched for many
years. With some difficulty Swertha extracted the
cork of one of them, by the help of a fork—for corkscrew
was there none at Jarlshof—and having ascertained
by smell, and, in case of any mistake, by
a moderate mouthful, that it contained wholesome
Barbadoes-waters, she carried it into the room,
where her master still continued to struggle with
his faintness. She then began to pour a small quantity
into the nearest cup that she could find, wisely
judging, that, upon a person so much unaccustomed
to the use of spirituous liquors, a little might produce
a strong effect. But the patient signed to her
impatiently to fill the cup, which might hold more
than the third of an English pint measure, up to
the very brim, and swallowed it down without
hesitation.</p>
<p>“Now the saunts above have a care on us!” said
Swertha; “he will be drunk as weel as mad, and
wha is to guide him then, I wonder?”</p>
<p>But Mertoun’s breath and colour returned, without
the slightest symptom of intoxication; on the
contrary, Swertha afterwards reported, that, “although
she had always had a firm opinion in favour
of a dram, yet she never saw one work such miracles—he
spoke mair like a man of the middle world,
than she had ever heard him since she had entered
his service.”</p>
<p>“Swertha,” he said, “you are right in this matter,
and I was wrong.—Go down to the Ranzelman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
directly, tell him to come and speak with me, without
an instant’s delay, and bring me special word
what boats and people he can command; I will
employ them all in the search, and they shall be
plentifully rewarded.”</p>
<p>Stimulated by the spur which maketh the old
woman proverbially to trot, Swertha posted down
to the hamlet, with all the speed of threescore, rejoicing
that her sympathetic feelings were likely to
achieve their own reward, having given rise to a
quest which promised to be so lucrative, and in the
profits whereof she was determined to have her share,
shouting out as she went, and long before she got
within hearing, the names of Niel Ronaldson, Sweyn
Erickson, and the other friends and confederates
who were interested in her mission. To say the
truth, notwithstanding that the good dame really
felt a deep interest in Mordaunt Mertoun, and was
mentally troubled on account of his absence, perhaps
few things would have disappointed her more
than if he had at this moment started up in her
path safe and sound, and rendered unnecessary,
by his appearance, the expense and the bustle of
searching after him.</p>
<p>Soon did Swertha accomplish her business in the
village, and adjust with the senators of the township
her own little share of per centage upon the
profits likely to accrue on her mission; and speedily
did she return to Jarlshof, with Niel Ronaldson by
her side, schooling him to the best of her skill in
all the peculiarities of her master.</p>
<p>“Aboon a’ things,” she said, “never make him
wait for an answer; and speak loud and distinct,
as if you were hailing a boat,—for he downa bide
to say the same thing twice over; and if he asks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
about distance, ye may make leagues for miles, for
he kens naething about the face of the earth that
he lives upon; and if he speak of siller, ye may ask
dollars for shillings, for he minds them nae mair
than sclate-stanes.”</p>
<p>Thus tutored, Niel Ronaldson was introduced
into the presence of Mertoun, but was utterly confounded
to find that he could not act upon the system
of deception which had been projected. When
he attempted, by some exaggeration of distance and
peril, to enhance the hire of the boats, and of the
men, (for the search was to be by sea and land,) he
found himself at once cut short by Mertoun, who
showed not only the most perfect knowledge of the
country, but of distances, tides, currents, and all
belonging to the navigation of those seas, although
these were topics with which he had hitherto appeared
to be totally unacquainted. The Ranzelman,
therefore, trembled when they came to speak of the
recompense to be afforded for their exertions in the
search; for it was not more unlikely that Mertoun
should be well informed of what was just and proper
upon this head than upon others; and Niel remembered
the storm of his fury, when, at an early
period after he had settled at Jarlshof, he drove
Swertha and Sweyn Erickson from his presence.
As, however, he stood hesitating betwixt the opposite
fears of asking too much or too little, Mertoun
stopped his mouth, and ended his uncertainty, by
promising him a recompense beyond what he dared
have ventured to ask, with an additional gratuity,
in case they returned with the pleasing intelligence
that his son was safe.</p>
<p>When this great point was settled, Niel Ronaldson,
like a man of conscience, began to consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
earnestly the various places where search should be
made after the young man; and having undertaken
faithfully that the enquiry should be prosecuted at
all the houses of the gentry, both in this and the
neighbouring islands, he added, that, “after all, if
his honour would not be angry, there was ane not
far off, that, if any body dared speer her a question,
and if she liked to answer it, could tell more about
Maister Mordaunt than any body else could.—Ye
will ken wha I mean, Swertha? Her that was down
at the haven this morning.” Thus he concluded,
addressing himself with a mysterious look to the
housekeeper, which she answered with a nod and
a wink.</p>
<p>“How mean you?” said Mertoun; “speak out,
short and open—whom do you speak of?”</p>
<p>“It is Norna of the Fitful-head,” said Swertha,
“that the Ranzelman is thinking about; for she has
gone up to Saint Ringan’s Kirk this morning on
business of her own.”</p>
<p>“And what can this person know of my son?”
said Mertoun; “she is, I believe, a wandering madwoman,
or impostor.”</p>
<p>“If she wanders,” said Swertha, “it is for nae lack
of means at hame, and that is weel known—plenty
of a’ thing has she of her ain, forby that the Fowd
himsell would let her want naething.”</p>
<p>“But what is that to my son?” said Mertoun,
impatiently.</p>
<p>“I dinna ken—she took unco pleasure in Maister
Mordaunt from the time she first saw him, and mony
a braw thing she gave him at ae time or another,
forby the gowd chain that hangs about his bonny
craig—folk say it is of fairy gold—I kenna what
gold it is, but Bryce Snailsfoot says, that the value<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
will mount to an hundred pounds English, and that
is nae deaf nuts.”</p>
<p>“Go, Ronaldson,” said Mertoun, “or else send some
one, to seek this woman out—if you think there
be a chance of her knowing any thing of my son.”</p>
<p>“She kens a’ thing that happens in thae islands,”
said Niel Ronaldson, “muckle sooner than other folk,
and that is Heaven’s truth. But as to going to the
kirk, or the kirkyard, to speer after her, there is not
a man in Zetland will do it, for meed or for money—and
that’s Heaven’s truth as weel as the other.”</p>
<p>“Cowardly, superstitious fools!” said Mertoun.—“But
give me my cloak, Swertha.—This woman has
been at Burgh-Westra—she is related to Troil’s
family—she may know something of Mordaunt’s absence,
and its cause—I will seek her myself—She
is at the Cross-kirk, you say?”</p>
<p>“No, not at the Cross-kirk, but at the auld Kirk
of Saint Ringan’s—it’s a dowie bit, and far frae
being canny; and if your honour,” added Swertha,
“wad walk by my rule, I wad wait until she came
back, and no trouble her when she may be mair
busied wi’ the dead, for ony thing that we ken, than
she is wi’ the living. The like of her carena to have
other folk’s een on them when they are, gude sain
us! doing their ain particular turns.”</p>
<p>Mertoun made no answer, but throwing his cloak
loosely around him, (for the day was misty, with
passing showers,) and leaving the decayed mansion
of Jarlshof, he walked at a pace much faster than
was usual with him, taking the direction of the ruinous
church, which stood, as he well knew, within
three or four miles of his dwelling.</p>
<p>The Ranzelman and Swertha stood gazing after
him in silence, until he was fairly out of ear-shot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
when, looking seriously on each other, and shaking
their sagacious heads in the same boding degree of
vibration, they uttered their remarks in the same
breath.</p>
<p>“Fools are aye fleet and fain,” said Swertha.</p>
<p>“Fey folk run fast,” added the Ranzelman; “and
the thing that we are born to, we cannot win by.—I
have known them that tried to stop folk that were
fey. You have heard of Helen Emberson of Camsey,
how she stopped all the boles and windows about
the house, that her gudeman might not see daylight,
and rise to the Haaf-fishing, because she feared foul
weather; and how the boat he should have sailed in
was lost in the Roost; and how she came back, rejoicing
in her gudeman’s safety—but ne’er may
care, for there she found him drowned in his own
masking-fat, within the wa’s of his ain biggin; and
moreover”——</p>
<p>But here Swertha reminded the Ranzelman that
he must go down to the haven to get off the fishing-boats;
“for both that my heart is sair for the bonny
lad, and that I am fear’d he cast up of his ain accord
before you are at sea; and, as I have often told ye,
my master may lead, but he winna drive; and if ye
do not his bidding, and get out to sea, the never a
bodle of boat-hire will ye see.”</p>
<p>“Weel, weel, good dame,” said the Ranzelman, “we
will launch as fast as we can; and by good luck,
neither Clawson’s boat, nor Peter Grot’s, is out to
the Haaf this morning, for a rabbit ran across the
path as they were going on board, and they came
back like wise men, kenning they wad be called to
other wark this day. And a marvel it is to think,
Swertha, how few real judicious men are left in this
land. There is our great Udaller is weel eneugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
when he is fresh, but he makes ower mony voyages
in his ship and his yawl to be lang sae; and now,
they say, his daughter, Mistress Minna, is sair out
of sorts.—Then there is Norna kens muckle mair
than other folk, but wise woman ye cannot call her.
Our tacksman here, Maister Mertoun, his wit is
sprung in the bowsprit, I doubt—his son is a daft
gowk; and I ken few of consequence hereabouts—excepting
always myself, and maybe you, Swertha—but
what may, in some sense or other, be called
fules.”</p>
<p>“That may be, Niel Ronaldson,” said the dame;
“but if you do not hasten the faster to the shore,
you will lose tide; and, as I said to my master some
short time syne, wha will be the fule then?”</p>

Till doomsday;—but all things have their end—<br>
Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men,<br>
Must have like death which we have.<br>

<p>The ruinous church of Saint Ninian had, in its
time, enjoyed great celebrity; for that mighty system
of Roman superstition, which spread its roots
over all Europe, had not failed to extend them even
to this remote archipelago, and Zetland had, in the
Catholic times, her saints, her shrines, and her relics,
which, though little known elsewhere, attracted
the homage, and commanded the observance, of
the simple inhabitants of Thule. Their devotion
to this church of Saint Ninian, or, as he was provincially
termed, Saint Ringan, situated, as the edifice
was, close to the sea-beach, and serving, in many
points, as a landmark to their boats, was particularly
obstinate, and was connected with so much superstitious
ceremonial and credulity, that the reformed
clergy thought it best, by an order of the Church
Courts, to prohibit all spiritual service within its
walls, as tending to foster the rooted faith of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
simple and rude people around in saint-worship, and
other erroneous doctrines of the Romish Church.</p>
<p>After the Church of Saint Ninian had been thus
denounced as a seat of idolatry, and desecrated of
course, the public worship was transferred to another
church; and the roof, with its lead and its
rafters, having been stripped from the little rude
old Gothic building, it was left in the wilderness to
the mercy of the elements. The fury of the uncontrolled
winds, which howled along an exposed
space, resembling that which we have described at
Jarlshof, very soon choked up nave and aisle, and,
on the north-west side, which was chiefly exposed
to the wind, hid the outside walls more than half
way up with mounds of drifted sand, over which
the gable-ends of the building, with the little belfry,
which was built above its eastern angle, arose
in ragged and shattered nakedness of ruin.</p>
<p>Yet, deserted as it was, the Kirk of Saint Ringan
still retained some semblance of the ancient homage
formerly rendered there. The rude and ignorant
fishermen of Dunrossness observed a practice, of
which they themselves had wellnigh forgotten the
origin, and from which the Protestant Clergy in
vain endeavoured to deter them. When their boats
were in extreme peril, it was common amongst them
to propose to vow an <i>awmous</i>, as they termed it,
that is, an alms, to Saint Ringan; and when the
danger was over, they never failed to absolve themselves
of their vow, by coming singly and secretly
to the old church, and putting off their shoes and
stockings at the entrance of the churchyard, walking
thrice around the ruins, observing that they did
so in the course of the sun. When the circuit was
accomplished for the third time, the votary dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
his offering, usually a small silver coin, through the
mullions of a lanceolated window, which opened
into a side aisle, and then retired, avoiding carefully
to look behind him till he was beyond the precincts
which had once been hallowed ground; for it was
believed that the skeleton of the saint received the
offering in his bony hand, and showed his ghastly
death’s-head at the window into which it was
thrown.</p>
<p>Indeed, the scene was rendered more appalling
to weak and ignorant minds, because the same
stormy and eddying winds, which, on the one side
of the church, threatened to bury the ruins with
sand, and had, in fact, heaped it up in huge quantities,
so as almost to hide the side-wall with its buttresses,
seemed in other places bent on uncovering
the graves of those who had been laid to their
long rest on the south-eastern quarter; and, after
an unusually hard gale, the coffins, and sometimes
the very corpses, of those who had been interred
without the usual cerements, were discovered, in a
ghastly manner, to the eyes of the living.</p>
<p>It was to this desolated place of worship that the
elder Mertoun now proceeded, though without any
of those religious or superstitious purposes with
which the church of Saint Ringan was usually approached.
He was totally without the superstitious
fears of the country,—nay, from the sequestered
and sullen manner in which he lived, withdrawing
himself from human society even when assembled
for worship, it was the general opinion that he
erred on the more fatal side, and believed rather
too little than too much of that which the Church
receives and enjoins to Christians.</p>
<p>As he entered the little bay, on the shore, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
almost on the beach of which the ruins are situated,
he could not help pausing for an instant, and becoming
sensible that the scene, as calculated to
operate on human feelings, had been selected with
much judgment as the site of a religious house.
In front lay the sea, into which two headlands,
which formed the extremities of the bay, projected
their gigantic causeways of dark and sable rocks,
on the ledges of which the gulls, scouries, and other
sea-fowl, appeared like flakes of snow; while, upon
the lower ranges of the cliff, stood whole lines of
cormorants, drawn up alongside of each other, like
soldiers in their battle array, and other living thing
was there none to see. The sea, although not in
a tempestuous state, was disturbed enough to rush
on these capes with a sound like distant thunder,
and the billows, which rose in sheets of foam half
way up these sable rocks, formed a contrast of
colouring equally striking and awful.</p>
<p>Betwixt the extremities, or capes, of these projecting
headlands, there rolled, on the day when
Mertoun visited the scene, a deep and dense aggregation
of clouds, through which no human eye could
penetrate, and which, bounding the vision, and excluding
all view of the distant ocean, rendered it no
unapt representation of the sea in the Vision of
Mirza whose extent was concealed by vapours, and
clouds, and storms. The ground rising steeply from
the sea-beach, permitting no view into the interior
of the country, appeared a scene of irretrievable barrenness,
where scrubby and stunted heath, intermixed
with the long bent, or coarse grass, which
first covers sandy soils, were the only vegetables
that could be seen. Upon a natural elevation, which
rose above the beach in the very bottom of the bay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and receded a little from the sea, so as to be without
reach of the waves, arose the half-buried ruin
which we have already described, surrounded by a
wasted, half-ruinous, and mouldering wall, which,
breached in several places, served still to divide
the precincts of the cemetery. The mariners who
were driven by accident into this solitary bay, pretended
that the church was occasionally observed to
be full of lights, and, from that circumstance, were
used to prophesy shipwrecks and deaths by sea.</p>
<p>As Mertoun approached near to the chapel, he
adopted, insensibly, and perhaps without much premeditation,
measures to avoid being himself seen,
until he came close under the walls of the burial-ground,
which he approached, as it chanced, on that
side where the sand was blowing from the graves,
in the manner we have described.</p>
<p>Here, looking through one of the gaps in the
wall which time had made, he beheld the person
whom he sought, occupied in a manner which assorted
well with the ideas popularly entertained of
her character, but which was otherwise sufficiently
extraordinary.</p>
<p>She was employed beside a rude monument, on
one side of which was represented the rough outline
of a cavalier, or knight, on horseback, while,
on the other, appeared a shield, with the armorial
bearings so defaced as not to be intelligible; which
escutcheon was suspended by one angle, contrary
to the modern custom, which usually places them
straight and upright. At the foot of this pillar was
believed to repose, as Mertoun had formerly heard,
the bones of Ribolt Troil, one of the remote ancestors
of Magnus, and a man renowned for deeds of
valorous emprize in the fifteenth century. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the grave of this warrior Norna of the Fitful-head
seemed busied in shovelling the sand, an easy task
where it was so light and loose; so that it seemed
plain that she would shortly complete what the rude
winds had begun, and make bare the bones which
lay there interred. As she laboured, she muttered
her magic song; for without the Runic rhyme no
form of northern superstition was ever performed.
We have perhaps preserved too many examples of
these incantations; but we cannot help attempting
to translate that which follows:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Champion, famed for warlike toil,<br>
Art thou silent, Ribolt Troil?<br>
Sand, and dust, and pebbly stones,<br>
Are leaving bare thy giant bones.<br>
Who dared touch the wild-bear’s skin<br>
Ye slumber’d on while life was in?—<br>
A woman now, or babe, may come,<br>
And cast the covering from thy tomb.<br>
<br>
“Yet be not wrathful, Chief, nor blight<br>
Mine eyes or ears with sound or sight!<br>
I come not, with unhallow’d tread,<br>
To wake the slumbers of the dead,<br>
Or lay thy giant relics bare;<br>
But what I seek thou well canst spare.<br>
Be it to my hand allow’d<br>
To shear a merk’s weight from thy shroud;<br>
Yet leave thee sheeted lead enough<br>
To shield thy bones from weather rough.<br>
<br>
“See, I draw my magic knife—<br>
Never while thou wert in life<br>
Laid’st thou still for sloth or fear,<br>
When point and edge were glittering near;<br>
See, the cerements now I sever—<br>
Waken now, or sleep for ever!<br>
Thou wilt not wake? the deed is done!—<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>The prize I sought is fairly won.<br>
<br>
“Thanks, Ribolt, thanks,—for this the sea<br>
Shall smooth its ruffled crest for thee,—<br>
And while afar its billows foam,<br>
Subside to peace near Ribolt’s tomb.<br>
Thanks, Ribolt, thanks—for this the might<br>
Of wild winds raging at their height,<br>
When to thy place of slumber nigh,<br>
Shall soften to a lullaby.<br>
<br>
“She, the dame of doubt and dread,<br>
Norna of the Fitful-head,<br>
Mighty in her own despite—<br>
Miserable in her might;<br>
In despair and frenzy great,—<br>
In her greatness desolate;<br>
Wisest, wickedest who lives,<br>
Well can keep the word she gives.”<br>
</p>
<p>While Norna chanted the first part of this rhyme,
she completed the task of laying bare a part of the
leaden coffin of the ancient warrior, and severed
from it, with much caution and apparent awe, a
portion of the metal. She then reverentially threw
back the sand upon the coffin; and by the time she
had finished her song, no trace remained that the
secrets of the sepulchre had been violated.</p>
<p>Mertoun remained gazing on her from behind
the churchyard wall during the whole ceremony,
not from any impression of veneration for her or
her employment, but because he conceived that to
interrupt a madwoman in her act of madness, was
not the best way to obtain from her such intelligence
as she might have to impart. Meanwhile he
had full time to consider her figure, although her
face was obscured by her dishevelled hair, and by
the hood of her dark mantle, which permitted no
more to be visible than a Druidess would probably
have exhibited at the celebration of her mystical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
rites. Mertoun had often heard of Norna before;
nay, it is most probable that he might have seen
her repeatedly, for she had been in the vicinity of
Jarlshof more than once since his residence there.
But the absurd stories which were in circulation
respecting her, prevented his paying any attention
to a person whom he regarded as either an impostor
or a madwoman, or a compound of both. Yet,
now that his attention was, by circumstances, involuntarily
fixed upon her person and deportment, he
could not help acknowledging to himself that she
was either a complete enthusiast, or rehearsed her
part so admirably, that no Pythoness of ancient
times could have excelled her. The dignity and
solemnity of her gesture,—the sonorous, yet impressive
tone of voice with which she addressed the
departed spirit whose mortal relics she ventured to
disturb, were such as failed not to make an impression
upon him, careless and indifferent as he generally
appeared to all that went on around him. But
no sooner was her singular occupation terminated,
than, entering the churchyard with some difficulty,
by clambering over the disjointed ruins of the wall,
he made Norna aware of his presence. Far from
starting, or expressing the least surprise at his appearance
in a place so solitary, she said, in a tone
that seemed to intimate that he had been expected,
“So,—you have sought me at last?”</p>
<p>“And found you,” replied Mertoun, judging he
would best introduce the enquiries he had to make,
by assuming a tone which corresponded to her own.</p>
<p>“Yes!” she replied, “found me you have, and
in the place where all men must meet—amid the
tabernacles of the dead.”</p>
<p>“Here we must, indeed, meet at last,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Mertoun, glancing his eyes on the desolate scene
around, where headstones, half covered in sand,
and others, from which the same wind had stripped
the soil on which they rested, covered with inscriptions,
and sculptured with the emblems of mortality,
were the most conspicuous objects,—“here,
as in the house of death, all men must meet at
length; and happy those that come soonest to the
quiet haven.”</p>
<p>“He that dares desire this haven,” said Norna,
“must have steered a steady course in the voyage
of life.  <i>I</i> dare not hope for such quiet harbour.
Darest <i>thou</i> expect it? or has the course thou hast
kept deserved it?”</p>
<p>“It matters not to my present purpose,” replied
Mertoun; “I have to ask you what tidings you
know of my son Mordaunt Mertoun?”</p>
<p>“A father,” replied the sibyl, “asks of a stranger
what tidings she has of his son! How should I
know aught of him? the cormorant says not to the
mallard, where is my brood?”</p>
<p>“Lay aside this useless affectation of mystery,”
said Mertoun; “with the vulgar and ignorant it
has its effect, but upon me it is thrown away. The
people of Jarlshof have told me that you do know,
or may know, something of Mordaunt Mertoun,
who has not returned home after the festival of
Saint John’s, held in the house of your relative,
Magnus Troil. Give me such information, if indeed
ye have it to give; and it shall be recompensed,
if the means of recompense are in my
power.”</p>
<p>“The wide round of earth,” replied Norna, “holds
nothing that I would call a recompense for the
slightest word that I throw away upon a living ear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
But for thy son, if thou wouldst see him in life,
repair to the approaching Fair of Kirkwall, in
Orkney.”</p>
<p>“And wherefore thither?” said Mertoun; “I
know he had no purpose in that direction.”</p>
<p>“We drive on the stream of fate,” answered
Norna, “without oar or rudder. You had no purpose
this morning of visiting the Kirk of Saint
Ringan, yet you are here;—you had no purpose
but a minute hence of being at Kirkwall, and yet
you will go thither.”</p>
<p>“Not unless the cause is more distinctly explained
to me. I am no believer, dame, in those
who assert your supernatural powers.”</p>
<p>“You shall believe in them ere we part,” said
Norna. “As yet you know but little of me, nor shall
you know more. But I know enough of you, and
could convince you with one word that I do so.”</p>
<p>“Convince me, then,” said Mertoun; “for unless
I am so convinced, there is little chance of my
following your counsel.”</p>
<p>“Mark, then,” said Norna, “what I have to say
on your son’s score, else what I shall say to you
on your own will banish every other thought from
your memory. You shall go to the approaching
Fair at Kirkwall; and, on the fifth day of the Fair,
you shall walk, at the hour of noon, in the outer
aisle of the Cathedral of Saint Magnus, and there
you shall meet a person who will give you tidings
of your son.”</p>
<p>“You must speak more distinctly, dame,” returned
Mertoun, scornfully, “if you hope that I
should follow your counsel. I have been fooled in
my time by women, but never so grossly as you
seem willing to gull me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Hearken, then!” said the old woman. “The
word which I speak shall touch the nearest secret
of thy life, and thrill thee through nerve and bone.”</p>
<p>So saying, she whispered a word into Mertoun’s
ear, the effect of which seemed almost magical. He
remained fixed and motionless with surprise, as,
waving her arm slowly aloft, with an air of superiority
and triumph, Norna glided from him, turned
round a corner of the ruins, and was soon out of
sight.</p>
<p>Mertoun offered not to follow, or to trace her.
“We fly from our fate in vain!” he said, as he began
to recover himself; and turning, he left behind
him the desolate ruins with their cemetery. As he
looked back from the very last point at which the
church was visible, he saw the figure of Norna,
muffled in her mantle, standing on the very summit
of the ruined tower, and stretching out in the sea-breeze
something which resembled a white pennon,
or flag. A feeling of horror, similar to that excited
by her last words, again thrilled through his bosom,
and he hastened onwards with unwonted speed,
until he had left the church of Saint Ninian, with its
bay of sand, far behind him.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at Jarlshof, the alteration in his
countenance was so great, that Swertha conjectured
he was about to fall into one of those fits of deep
melancholy which she termed his dark hour.</p>
<p>“And what better could be expected,” thought
Swertha, “when he must needs go visit Norna of
the Fitful-head, when she was in the haunted Kirk
of Saint Ringan’s?”</p>
<p>But without testifying any other symptoms of
an alienated mind, than that of deep and sullen
dejection, her master acquainted her with his inten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tion
to go to the Fair of Kirkwall,—a thing so
contrary to his usual habits, that the housekeeper
wellnigh refused to credit her ears. Shortly after,
he heard, with apparent indifference, the accounts
returned by the different persons who had been sent
out in quest of Mordaunt, by sea and land, who all
of them returned without any tidings. The equanimity
with which Mertoun heard the report of
their bad success, convinced Swertha still more
firmly, that, in his interview with Norna, that issue
had been predicted to him by the sibyl whom he
had consulted.</p>
<p>The township were yet more surprised, when
their tacksman, Mr. Mertoun, as if on some sudden
resolution, made preparations to visit Kirkwall
during the Fair, although he had hitherto
avoided sedulously all such places of public resort.
Swertha puzzled herself a good deal, without being
able to penetrate this mystery; and vexed herself
still more concerning the fate of her young master.
But her concern was much softened by the deposit
of a sum of money, seeming, however moderate in
itself, a treasure in her eyes, which her master put
into her hands, acquainting her at the same time,
that he had taken his passage for Kirkwall, in a
small bark belonging to the proprietor of the island
of Mousa.</p>

<p>The condition of Minna much resembled that of
the village heroine in Lady Ann Lindsay’s beautiful
ballad. Her natural firmness of mind prevented
her from sinking under the pressure of the horrible
secret, which haunted her while awake, and was yet
more tormenting during her broken and hurried
slumbers. There is no grief so dreadful as that
which we dare not communicate, and in which we
can neither ask nor desire sympathy; and when to
this is added the burden of a guilty mystery to an
innocent bosom, there is little wonder that Minna’s
health should have sunk under the burden.</p>
<p>To the friends around, her habits and manners,
nay, her temper, seemed altered to such an extraordinary
degree, that it is no wonder that some
should have ascribed the change to witchcraft, and
some to incipient madness. She became unable to
bear the solitude in which she formerly delighted
to spend her time; yet when she hurried into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
society, it was without either joining in, or attending
to, what passed. Generally she appeared wrapped
in sad, and even sullen abstraction, until her attention
was suddenly roused by some casual mention
of the name of Cleveland, or of Mordaunt Mertoun,
at which she started, with the horror of one who
sees the lighted match applied to a charged mine,
and expects to be instantly involved in the effects
of the explosion. And when she observed that the
discovery was not yet made, it was so far from being
a consolation, that she almost wished the worst were
known, rather than endure the continued agonies of
suspense.</p>
<p>Her conduct towards her sister was so variable,
yet uniformly so painful to the kind-hearted Brenda,
that it seemed to all around, one of the strongest
features of her malady. Sometimes Minna was
impelled to seek her sister’s company, as if by the
consciousness that they were common sufferers by
a misfortune of which she herself alone could grasp
the extent; and then suddenly the feeling of the
injury which Brenda had received through the supposed
agency of Cleveland, made her unable to bear
her presence, and still less to endure the consolation
which her sister, mistaking the nature of her
malady, vainly endeavoured to administer. Frequently,
also, did it happen, that, while Brenda was
imploring her sister to take comfort, she incautiously
touched upon some subject which thrilled to the very
centre of her soul; so that, unable to conceal her agony,
Minna would rush hastily from the apartment. All
these different moods, though they too much resembled,
to one who knew not their real source, the
caprices of unkind estrangement, Brenda endured
with such prevailing and unruffled gentleness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
disposition, that Minna was frequently moved to
shed floods of tears upon her neck; and, perhaps, the
moments in which she did so, though embittered by
the recollection that her fatal secret concerned the
destruction of Brenda’s happiness as well as her
own, were still, softened as they were by sisterly
affection, the most endurable moments of this most
miserable period of her life.</p>
<p>The effects of the alternations of moping melancholy,
fearful agitation, and bursts of nervous feeling,
were soon visible on the poor young woman’s
face and person. She became pale and emaciated;
her eye lost the steady quiet look of happiness and
innocence, and was alternately dim and wild, as she
was acted upon by a general feeling of her own distressful
condition, or by some quicker and more poignant
sense of agony. Her very features seemed to
change, and become sharp and eager, and her voice,
which, in its ordinary tones, was low and placid,
now sometimes sunk in indistinct mutterings, and
sometimes was raised beyond the natural key, in
hasty and abrupt exclamations. When in company
with others, she was sullenly silent, and, when she
ventured into solitude, was observed (for it was
now thought very proper to watch her on such occasions)
to speak much to herself.</p>
<p>The pharmacy of the islands was in vain resorted
to by Minna’s anxious father. Sages of both sexes,
who knew the virtues of every herb which drinks
the dew, and augmented those virtues by words of
might, used while they prepared and applied the
medicines, were attended with no benefit; and Magnus,
in the utmost anxiety, was at last induced to
have recourse to the advice of his kinswoman, Norna
of the Fitful-head, although, owing to circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
noticed in the course of the story, there was at this
time some estrangement between them. His first
application was in vain. Norna was then at her
usual place of residence, upon the sea-coast, near the
headland from which she usually took her designation;
but, although Eric Scambester himself brought
the message, she refused positively to see him, or to
return any answer.</p>
<p>Magnus was angry at the slight put upon his
messenger and message, but his anxiety on Minna’s
account, as well as the respect which he had for
Norna’s real misfortunes and imputed wisdom and
power, prevented him from indulging, on the present
occasion, his usual irritability of disposition. On the
contrary, he determined to make an application to
his kinswoman in his own person. He kept his
purpose, however, to himself, and only desired his
daughters to be in readiness to attend him upon a
visit to a relation whom he had not seen for some
time, and directed them, at the same time, to carry
some provisions along with them, as the journey
was distant, and they might perhaps find their
friend unprovided.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to ask explanations of his pleasure,
and hoping that exercise and the amusement
of such an excursion might be of service to her sister,
Brenda, upon whom all household and family
charges now devolved, caused the necessary preparations
to be made for the expedition; and, on the
next morning, they were engaged in tracing the long
and tedious course of beach and of moorland, which,
only varied by occasional patches of oats and barley,
where a little ground had been selected for cultivation,
divided Burgh-Westra from the north-western
extremity of the Mainland, (as the principal island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is called,) which terminates in the cape called Fitful-head,
as the south-western point ends in the cape of
Sumburgh.</p>
<p>On they went, through wild and over wold, the
Udaller bestriding a strong, square-made, well-barrelled
palfrey, of Norwegian breed, somewhat taller,
and yet as stout, as the ordinary ponies of the country;
while Minna and Brenda, famed, amongst other
accomplishments, for their horsemanship, rode two
of those hardy animals, which, bred and reared with
more pains than is usually bestowed, showed, both
by the neatness of their form and their activity,
that the race, so much and so carelessly neglected,
is capable of being improved into beauty without
losing any thing of its spirit or vigour. They were
attended by two servants on horseback, and two on
foot, secure that the last circumstance would be no
delay to their journey, because a great part of the
way was so rugged, or so marshy, that the horses
could only move at a foot pace; and that, whenever
they met with any considerable tract of hard and
even ground, they had only to borrow from the
nearest herd of ponies the use of a couple for the
accommodation of these pedestrians.</p>
<p>The journey was a melancholy one, and little conversation
passed, except when the Udaller, pressed
by impatience and vexation, urged his pony to a
quick pace, and again, recollecting Minna’s weak
state of health, slackened to a walk, and reiterated
enquiries how she felt herself, and whether the fatigue
was not too much for her. At noon the party
halted, and partook of some refreshment, for which
they had made ample provision, beside a pleasant
spring, the pureness of whose waters, however, did
not suit the Udaller’s palate, until qualified by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
liberal addition of right Nantz. After he had a
second, yea and a third time, filled a large silver
travelling-cup, embossed with a German Cupid
smoking a pipe, and a German Bacchus emptying
his flask down the throat of a bear, he began to become
more talkative than vexation had permitted
him to be during the early part of their journey,
and thus addressed his daughters:—</p>
<p>“Well, children, we are within a league or two
of Norna’s dwelling, and we shall soon see how the
old spell-mutterer will receive us.”</p>
<p>Minna interrupted her father with a faint exclamation,
while Brenda, surprised to a great degree,
exclaimed, “Is it then to Norna that we are to make
this visit?—Heaven forbid!”</p>
<p>“And wherefore should Heaven forbid?” said the
Udaller, knitting his brows; “wherefore, I would
gladly know, should Heaven forbid me to visit my
kinswoman, whose skill may be of use to your sister,
if any woman in Zetland, or man either, can be
of service to her?—You are a fool, Brenda,—your
sister has more sense.—Cheer up, Minna!—thou
wert ever wont to like her songs and stories, and
used to hang about her neck, when little Brenda
cried and ran from her like a Spanish merchantman
from a Dutch caper.”<a id="FNanchor2_15_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_15_19">[15]</a></p>
<p>“I wish she may not frighten me as much to-day,
father,” replied Brenda, desirous of indulging Minna
in her taciturnity, and at the same time to amuse
her father by sustaining the conversation; “I have
heard so much of her dwelling, that I am rather
alarmed at the thought of going there uninvited.”</p>
<p>“Thou art a fool,” said Magnus, “to think that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
visit from her kinsfolks can ever come amiss to a
kind, hearty, Hialtland heart, like my cousin Norna’s.—And,
now I think on’t, I will be sworn that is
the reason why she would not receive Eric Scambester!—It
is many a long day since I have seen
her chimney smoke, and I have never carried you
thither—She hath indeed some right to call me
unkind. But I will tell her the truth—and that
is, that though such be the fashion, I do not think
it is fair or honest to eat up the substance of lone
women-folks, as we do that of our brother Udallers,
when we roll about from house to house in the
winter season, until we gather like a snowball, and
eat up all wherever we come.”</p>
<p>“There is no fear of our putting Norna to any
distress just now,” replied Brenda, “for I have ample
provision of every thing that we can possibly need—fish,
and bacon, and salted mutton, and dried
geese—more than we could eat in a week, besides
enough of liquor for you, father.”</p>
<p>“Right, right, my girl!” said the Udaller; “a
well-found ship makes a merry voyage—so we
shall only want the kindness of Norna’s roof, and a
little bedding for you; for, as to myself, my sea-cloak,
and honest dry boards of Norway deal, suit
me better than your eider-down cushions and mattresses.
So that Norna will have the pleasure of
seeing us without having a stiver’s worth of trouble.”</p>
<p>“I wish she may think it a pleasure, sir,” replied
Brenda.</p>
<p>“Why, what does the girl mean, in the name of
the Martyr?” replied Magnus Troil; “dost thou
think my kinswoman is a heathen, who will not rejoice
to see her own flesh and blood?—I would I
were as sure of a good year’s fishing!—No, no! I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
only fear we may find her from home at present, for
she is often a wanderer, and all with thinking over
much on what can never be helped.”</p>
<p>Minna sighed deeply as her father spoke, and the
Udaller went on:—</p>
<p>“Dost thou sigh at that, my girl?—why, ’tis the
fault of half the world—let it never be thine own,
Minna.”</p>
<p>Another suppressed sigh intimated that the caution
came too late.</p>
<p>“I believe you are afraid of my cousin as well as
Brenda is,” said the Udaller, gazing on her pale
countenance; “if so, speak the word, and we will
return back again as if we had the wind on our
quarter, and were running fifteen knots by the line.”</p>
<p>“Do, for Heaven’s sake, sister, let us return!”
said Brenda, imploringly; “you know—you remember—you
must be well aware that Norna can
do nought to help you.”</p>
<p>“It is but too true,” said Minna, in a subdued
voice; “but I know not—she may answer a question—a
question that only the miserable dare ask
of the miserable.”</p>
<p>“Nay, my kinswoman is no miser,” answered the
Udaller, who only heard the beginning of the word;
“a good income she has, both in Orkney and here,
and many a fair lispund of butter is paid to her.
But the poor have the best share of it, and shame
fall the Zetlander who begrudges them; the rest she
spends, I wot not how, in her journeys through the
islands. But you will laugh to see her house, and
Nick Strumpfer, whom she calls Pacolet—many
folks think Nick is the devil; but he is flesh and
blood, like any of us—his father lived in Græmsay—I
shall be glad to see Nick again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>”</p>
<p>While the Udaller thus ran on, Brenda, who, in
recompense for a less portion of imagination than
her sister, was gifted with sound common sense, was
debating with herself the probable effect of this visit
on her sister’s health. She came finally to the resolution
of speaking with her father aside, upon the
first occasion which their journey should afford. To
him she determined to communicate the whole particulars
of their nocturnal interview with Norna,—to
which, among other agitating causes, she attributed
the depression of Minna’s spirits,—and then
make himself the judge whether he ought to persist
in his visit to a person so singular, and expose his
daughter to all the shock which her nerves might
possibly receive from the interview.</p>
<p>Just as she had arrived at this conclusion, her
father, dashing the crumbs from his laced waistcoat
with one hand, and receiving with the other a fourth
cup of brandy and water, drank devoutly to the success
of their voyage, and ordered all to be in readiness
to set forward. Whilst they were saddling
their ponies, Brenda, with some difficulty, contrived
to make her father understand she wished to speak
with him in private—no small surprise to the
honest Udaller, who, though secret as the grave in
the very few things where he considered secrecy as
of importance, was so far from practising mystery in
general, that his most important affairs were often
discussed by him openly in presence of his whole
family, servants included.</p>
<p>But far greater was his astonishment, when, remaining
purposely with his daughter Brenda, a little
in the wake, as he termed it, of the other riders, he
heard the whole account of Norna’s visit to Burgh-Westra,
and of the communication with which she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
had then astounded his daughters. For a long time
he could utter nothing but interjections, and ended
with a thousand curses on his kinswoman’s folly in
telling his daughters such a history of horror.</p>
<p>“I have often heard,” said the Udaller, “that she
was quite mad, with all her wisdom, and all her
knowledge of the seasons; and, by the bones of my
namesake, the Martyr, I begin now to believe it
most assuredly! I know no more how to steer than
if I had lost my compass. Had I known this before
we set out, I think I had remained at home; but
now that we have come so far, and that Norna expects
us”——</p>
<p>“Expects us, father!” said Brenda; “how can
that be possible?”</p>
<p>“Why, that I know not—but she that can tell
how the wind is to blow, can tell which way we are
designing to ride. She must not be provoked;—perhaps
she has done my family this ill for the
words I had with her about that lad Mordaunt Mertoun,
and if so, she can undo it again;—and so she
shall, or I will know the cause wherefore. But I
will try fair words first.”</p>
<p>Finding it thus settled that they were to go forward,
Brenda endeavoured next to learn from her
father whether Norna’s tale was founded in reality.
He shook his head, groaned bitterly, and, in a few
words, acknowledged that the whole, so far as concerned
her intrigue with a stranger, and her father’s
death, of which she became the accidental and most
innocent cause, was a matter of sad and indisputable
truth. “For her infant,” he said, “he could never,
by any means, learn what became of it.”</p>
<p>“Her infant!” exclaimed Brenda; “she spoke
not a word of her infant!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Then I wish my tongue had been blistered,”
said the Udaller, “when I told you of it!—I see
that, young and old, a man has no better chance of
keeping a secret from you women, than an eel to
keep himself in his hold when he is sniggled with
a loop of horse-hair—sooner or later the fisher
teazes him out of his hole, when he has once the
noose round his neck.”</p>
<p>“But the infant, my father,” said Brenda, still
insisting on the particulars of this extraordinary
story, “what became of it?”</p>
<p>“Carried off, I fancy, by the blackguard Vaughan,”
answered the Udaller, with a gruff accent, which
plainly betokened how weary he was of the subject.</p>
<p>“By Vaughan?” said Brenda, “the lover of poor
Norna, doubtless!—what sort of man was he,
father?”</p>
<p>“Why, much like other men, I fancy,” answered
the Udaller; “I never saw him in my life.—He
kept company with the Scottish families at Kirkwall;
and I with the good old Norse folk—Ah! if
Norna had dwelt always amongst her own kin, and
not kept company with her Scottish acquaintance,
she would have known nothing of Vaughan, and
things might have been otherwise—But then I
should have known nothing of your blessed mother,
Brenda—and that,” he said, his large blue eyes
shining with a tear, “would have saved me a short
joy and a long sorrow.”</p>
<p>“Norna could but ill have supplied my mother’s
place to you, father, as a companion and a friend—that
is, judging from all I have heard,” said Brenda,
with some hesitation. But Magnus, softened by
recollections of his beloved wife, answered her with
more indulgence than she expected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>“I would have been content,” he said, “to have
wedded Norna at that time. It would have been
the soldering of an old quarrel—the healing of an
old sore. All our blood relations wished it, and,
situated as I was, especially not having seen your
blessed mother, I had little will to oppose their
counsels. You must not judge of Norna or of me
by such an appearance as we now present to you—She
was young and beautiful, and I gamesome as
a Highland buck, and little caring what haven I
made for, having, as I thought, more than one under
my lee. But Norna preferred this man Vaughan,
and, as I told you before, it was, perhaps, the best
kindness she could have done to me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, poor kinswoman!” said Brenda. “But
believe you, father, in the high powers which she
claims—in the mysterious vision of the dwarf—in
the”——</p>
<p>She was interrupted in these questions by Magnus,
to whom they were obviously displeasing.</p>
<p>“I believe, Brenda,” he said, “according to the
belief of my forefathers—I pretend not to be a
wiser man than they were in their time,—and they
all believed that, in cases of great worldly distress,
Providence opened the eyes of the mind, and afforded
the sufferers a vision of futurity. It was
but a trimming of the boat, with reverence,”—here
he touched his hat reverentially; “and, after all the
shifting of ballast, poor Norna is as heavily loaded
in the bows as ever was an Orkneyman’s yawl at the
dog-fishing—she has more than affliction enough on
board to balance whatever gifts she may have had
in the midst of her calamity. They are as painful
to her, poor soul, as a crown of thorns would be to
her brows, though it were the badge of the em<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>pire
of Denmark. And do not you, Brenda, seek to
be wiser than your fathers. Your sister Minna, before
she was so ill, had as much reverence for whatever
was produced in Norse, as if it had been in the
Pope’s bull, which is all written in pure Latin.”</p>
<p>“Poor Norna!” repeated Brenda; “and her child—was
it never recovered?”</p>
<p>“What do I know of her child,” said the Udaller,
more gruffly than before, “except that she was
very ill, both before and after the birth, though we
kept her as merry as we could with pipe and harp,
and so forth;—the child had come before its time
into this bustling world, so it is likely it has been
long dead.—But you know nothing of all these
matters, Brenda; so get along for a foolish girl, and
ask no more questions about what it does not become
you to enquire into.”</p>
<p>So saying, the Udaller gave his sturdy little palfrey
the spur, and cantering forward over rough and
smooth, while the pony’s accuracy and firmness of
step put all difficulties of the path at secure defiance,
he placed himself soon by the side of the melancholy
Minna, and permitted her sister to have no farther
share in his conversation than as it was addressed
to them jointly. She could but comfort herself
with the hope, that, as Minna’s disease appeared to
have its seat in the imagination, the remedies recommended
by Norna might have some chance of being
effectual, since, in all probability, they would be
addressed to the same faculty.</p>
<p>Their way had hitherto held chiefly over moss
and moor, varied occasionally by the necessity of
making a circuit around the heads of those long
lagoons, called voes, which run up into and indent
the country in such a manner, that, though the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Mainland of Zetland may be thirty miles or more
in length, there is, perhaps, no part of it which is
more than three miles distant from the salt water.
But they had now approached the north-western
extremity of the isle, and travelled along the top
of an immense ridge of rocks, which had for ages
withstood the rage of the Northern Ocean, and of
all the winds by which it is buffeted.</p>
<p>At length exclaimed Magnus to his daughters,
“There is Norna’s dwelling!—Look up, Minna,
my love; for if this does not make you laugh, nothing
will.—Saw you ever any thing but an osprey
that would have made such a nest for herself as
that is?—By my namesake’s bones, there is not
the like of it that living thing ever dwelt in, (having
no wings and the use of reason,) unless it chanced
to be the Frawa-Stack off Papa, where the King’s
daughter of Norway was shut up to keep her from
her lovers—and all to little purpose, if the tale be
true;<a id="FNanchor2_16_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_16_20">[16]</a> for, maidens, I would have you to wot that

</p>
<p>The dwelling of Norna, though none but a native
of Zetland, familiar, during his whole life, with
every variety of rock-scenery, could have seen any
thing ludicrous in this situation, was not unaptly
compared by Magnus Troil to the eyry of the osprey,
or sea-eagle. It was very small, and had been
fabricated out of one of those dens which are called
Burghs and Picts-houses in Zetland, and Duns on
the mainland of Scotland and the Hebrides, and
which seem to be the first effort at architecture—the
connecting link betwixt a fox’s hole in a cairn of
loose stones, and an attempt to construct a human
habitation out of the same materials, without the
use of lime or cement of any kind,—without any
timber, so far as can be seen from their remains,—without
any knowledge of the arch or of the stair.
Such as they are, however, the numerous remains
of these dwellings—for there is one found on every
headland, islet, or point of vantage, which could
afford the inhabitants additional means of defence—tend
to prove that the remote people by whom these
Burghs were constructed, were a numerous race,
and that the islands had then a much greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
population, than, from other circumstances, we might
have been led to anticipate.</p>
<p>The Burgh of which we at present speak had
been altered and repaired at a later period, probably
by some petty despot, or sea-rover, who, tempted
by the security of the situation, which occupied
the whole of a projecting point of rock, and was
divided from the mainland by a rent or chasm of
some depth, had built some additions to it in the
rudest style of Gothic defensive architecture;—had
plastered the inside with lime and clay, and broken
out windows for the admission of light and air;
and, finally, by roofing it over, and dividing it into
stories, by means of beams of wreck-wood, had
converted the whole into a tower, resembling a pyramidical
dovecot, formed by a double wall, still containing
within its thickness that set of circular
galleries, or concentric rings, which is proper to all
the forts of this primitive construction, and which
seem to have constituted the only shelter which
they were originally qualified to afford to their shivering
inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor2_18_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_18_22">[18]</a></p>
<p>This singular habitation, built out of the loose
stones which lay scattered around, and exposed for
ages to the vicissitudes of the elements, was as grey,
weatherbeaten, and wasted, as the rock on which
it was founded, and from which it could not easily
be distinguished, so completely did it resemble in
colour, and so little did it differ in regularity of
shape, from a pinnacle or fragment of the cliff.</p>
<p>Minna’s habitual indifference to all that of late
had passed around her, was for a moment suspended
by the sight of an abode, which, at another and
happier period of her life, would have attracted at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
once her curiosity and her wonder. Even now she
seemed to feel interest as she gazed upon this singular
retreat, and recollected it was that of certain
misery and probable insanity, connected, as its inhabitant
asserted, and Minna’s faith admitted, with
power over the elements, and the capacity of intercourse
with the invisible world.</p>
<p>“Our kinswoman,” she muttered, “has chosen
her dwelling well, with no more of earth than a
sea-fowl might rest upon, and all around sightless
tempests and raging waves. Despair and magical
power could not have a fitter residence.”</p>
<p>Brenda, on the other hand, shuddered when she
looked on the dwelling to which they were advancing,
by a difficult, dangerous, and precarious path,
which sometimes, to her great terror, approached
to the verge of the precipice; so that, Zetlander as
she was, and confident as she had reason to be, in
the steadiness and sagacity of the sure-footed pony,
she could scarce suppress an inclination to giddiness,
especially at one point, when, being foremost
of the party, and turning a sharp angle of the rock,
her feet, as they projected from the side of the pony,
hung for an instant sheer over the ledge of the precipice,
so that there was nothing save empty space
betwixt the sole of her shoe and the white foam of
the vexed ocean, which dashed, howled, and foamed,
five hundred feet below. What would have driven
a maiden of another country into delirium, gave
her but a momentary uneasiness, which was instantly
lost in the hope that the impression which
the scene appeared to make on her sister’s imagination
might be favourable to her cure.</p>
<p>She could not help looking back to see how Minna
should pass the point of peril, which she herself had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>just rounded; and could hear the strong voice of
the Udaller, though to him such rough paths were
familiar as the smooth sea-beach, call, in a tone of
some anxiety, “Take heed, jarto,”<a id="FNanchor2_19_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_19_23">[19]</a> as Minna, with
an eager look, dropped her bridle, and stretched forward
her arms, and even her body, over the precipice,
in the attitude of the wild swan, when balancing
itself, and spreading its broad pinions, it prepares
to launch from the cliff upon the bosom of the
winds. Brenda felt, at that instant, a pang of unutterable
terror, which left a strong impression on
her nerves, even when relieved, as it instantly was,
by her sister recovering herself and sitting upright
on her saddle, the opportunity and temptation (if
she felt it) passing away, as the quiet steady animal
which supported her rounded the projecting angle,
and turned its patient and firm step from the verge
of the precipice.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<img alt="" src="images/i_483.jpg" title="" id="img_images_i_483.jpg" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>
<p>They now attained a more level and open space
of ground, being the flat top of an isthmus of projecting
rock, narrowing again towards a point where
it was terminated by the chasm which separated the
small peak, or <i>stack</i>, occupied by Norna’s habitation,
from the main ridge of cliff and precipice. This
natural fosse, which seemed to have been the work
of some convulsion of nature, was deep, dark, and irregular,
narrower towards the bottom, which could
not be distinctly seen, and widest at top, having the
appearance as if that part of the cliff occupied by
the building had been half rent away from the isthmus
which it terminated,—an idea favoured by the
angle at which it seemed to recede from the land,
and lean towards the sea, with the building which
crowned it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<p>This angle of projection was so considerable, that
it required recollection to dispel the idea that the
rock, so much removed from the perpendicular, was
about to precipitate itself seaward, with its old
tower: and a timorous person would have been
afraid to put foot upon it, lest an addition of weight,
so inconsiderable as that of the human body, should
hasten a catastrophe which seemed at every instant
impending.</p>
<p>Without troubling himself about such fantasies,
the Udaller rode towards the tower, and there dismounting
along with his daughters, gave the ponies
in charge to one of their domestics, with directions
to disencumber them of their burdens, and turn them
out for rest and refreshment upon the nearest heath.
This done, they approached the gate, which seemed
formerly to have been connected with the land by
a rude drawbridge, some of the apparatus of which
was still visible. But the rest had been long demolished,
and was replaced by a stationary footbridge,
formed of barrel-staves covered with turf,
very narrow and ledgeless, and supported by a sort
of arch, constructed out of the jaw-bones of the
whale. Along this “brigg of dread” the Udaller
stepped with his usual portly majesty of stride, which
threatened its demolition and his own at the same
time; his daughters trode more lightly and more
safely after him, and the whole party stood before
the low and rugged portal of Norna’s habitation.</p>
<p>“If she should be abroad after all,” said Magnus,
as he plied the black oaken door with repeated
blows;—“but if so, we will at least lie by a day
for her return, and make Nick Strumpfer pay the
demurrage in bland and brandy.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the door opened, and displayed, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the alarm of Brenda, and the surprise of Minna herself,
a square-made dwarf, about four feet five inches
high, with a head of most portentous size, and features
correspondent—namely, a huge mouth, a tremendous
nose, with large black nostrils, which
seemed to have been slit upwards, blubber lips of an
unconscionable size, and huge wall-eyes, with which
he leared, sneered, grinned, and goggled on the
Udaller as an old acquaintance, without uttering a
single word. The young women could hardly persuade
themselves that they did not see before their
eyes the very demon Trolld, who made such a distinguished
figure in Norna’s legend. Their father
went on addressing this uncouth apparition in terms
of such condescending friendship as the better sort
apply to their inferiors, when they wish, for any
immediate purpose, to conciliate or coax them,—a
tone, by the by, which generally contains, in its
very familiarity, as much offence as the more direct
assumption of distance and superiority.</p>
<p>“Ha, Nick! honest Nick!” said the Udaller,
“here you are, lively and lovely as Saint Nicholas
your namesake, when he is carved with an axe for
the headpiece of a Dutch dogger. How dost thou
do, Nick, or Pacolet, if you like that better? Nicholas,
here are my two daughters, nearly as handsome
as thyself thou seest.”</p>
<p>Nick grinned, and did a clumsy obeisance by way
of courtesy, but kept his broad misshapen person
firmly placed in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Daughters,” continued the Udaller, who seemed
to have his reasons for speaking this Cerberus fair,
at least according to his own notions of propitiation,—“this
is Nick Strumpfer, maidens, whom his
mistress calls Pacolet, being a light-limbed dwarf,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
as you see, like him that wont to fly about, like a
<i>Scourie</i>, on his wooden hobbyhorse, in the old storybook
of Valentine and Orson, that you, Minna, used
to read whilst you were a child. I assure you he
can keep his mistress’s counsel, and never told one
of her secrets in his life—ha, ha, ha!”</p>
<p>The ugly dwarf grinned ten times wider than before,
and showed the meaning of the Udaller’s jest,
by opening his immense jaws, and throwing back
his head, so as to discover, that, in the immense
cavity of his mouth, there only remained the small
shrivelled remnant of a tongue, capable, perhaps, of
assisting him in swallowing his food, but unequal to
the formation of articulate sounds. Whether this
organ had been curtailed by cruelty, or injured by
disease, it was impossible to guess; but that the unfortunate
being had not been originally dumb, was
evident from his retaining the sense of hearing.
Having made this horrible exhibition, he repaid the
Udaller’s mirth with a loud, horrid, and discordant
laugh, which had something in it the more hideous
that his mirth seemed to be excited by his own misery.
The sisters looked on each other in silence and
fear, and even the Udaller appeared disconcerted.</p>
<p>“And how now?” he proceeded, after a minute’s
pause. “When didst thou wash that throat of thine,
that is about the width of the Pentland Frith, with
a cup of brandy? Ha, Nick! I have that with me
which is sound stuff, boy, ha!”</p>
<p>The dwarf bent his beetle-brows, shook his misshapen
head, and made a quick sharp indication,
throwing his right hand up to his shoulder with the
thumb pointed backwards.</p>
<p>“What! my kinswoman,” said the Udaller, comprehending
the signal, “will be angry? Well, shalt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have a flask to carouse when she is from home, old
acquaintance;—lips and throats may swallow
though they cannot speak.”</p>
<p>Pacolet grinned a grim assent.</p>
<p>“And now,” said the Udaller, “stand out of the
way, Pacolet, and let me carry my daughters to
see their kinswoman. By the bones of Saint Magnus,
it shall be a good turn in thy way!—nay,
never shake thy head, man; for if thy mistress be
at home, see her we will.”</p>
<p>The dwarf again intimated the impossibility of
their being admitted, partly by signs, partly by
mumbling some uncouth and most disagreeable
sounds, and the Udaller’s mood began to arise.</p>
<p>“Tittle tattle, man!” said he; “trouble not me
with thy gibberish, but stand out of the way, and
the blame, if there be any, shall rest with me.”</p>
<p>So saying, Magnus Troil laid his sturdy hand
upon the collar of the recusant dwarf’s jacket of
blue wadmaal, and, with a strong, but not a violent
grasp, removed him from the doorway, pushed him
gently aside, and entered, followed by his two daughters,
whom a sense of apprehension, arising out of all
which they saw and heard, kept very close to him.
A crooked and dusky passage through which Magnus
led the way, was dimly enlightened by a shot-hole,
communicating with the interior of the building,
and originally intended, doubtless, to command the entrance
by a hagbut or culverin. As they approached
nearer, for they walked slowly and with hesitation,
the light, imperfect as it was, was suddenly obscured;
and, on looking upward to discern the
cause, Brenda was startled to observe the pale and
obscurely-seen countenance of Norna gazing downward
upon them, without speaking a word. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
was nothing extraordinary in this, as the mistress
of the mansion might be naturally enough looking
out to see what guests were thus suddenly and
unceremoniously intruding themselves on her presence.
Still, however, the natural paleness of her
features, exaggerated by the light in which they
were at present exhibited,—the immovable sternness
of her look, which showed neither kindness nor
courtesy of civil reception,—her dead silence, and
the singular appearance of every thing about her
dwelling, augmented the dismay which Brenda had
already conceived. Magnus Troil and Minna had
walked slowly forward, without observing the apparition
of their singular hostess.</p>

The witch then raised her wither’d arm,<br>

</p>
<p>“This should be the stair,” said the Udaller, blundering
in the dark against some steps of irregular ascent—“This
should be the stair, unless my memory
greatly fail me; ay, and there she sits,” he added,
pausing at a half-open door, “with all her tackle
about her as usual, and as busy, doubtless, as the
devil in a gale of wind.”</p>
<p>As he made this irreverent comparison, he entered,
followed by his daughters, the darkened apartment
in which Norna was seated, amidst a confused collection
of books of various languages, parchment
scrolls, tablets and stones inscribed with the straight
and angular characters of the Runic alphabet, and
similar articles, which the vulgar might have connected
with the exercise of the forbidden arts.
There were also lying in the chamber, or hung over
the rude and ill-contrived chimney, an old shirt of
mail, with the headpiece, battle-axe, and lance, which
had once belonged to it; and on a shelf were disposed,
in great order, several of those curious stone-axes,
formed of green granite, which are often found
in those islands, where they are called thunderbolts
by the common people, who usually preserve them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
as a charm of security against the effects of lightning.
There was, moreover, to be seen amid the
strange collection, a stone sacrificial knife, used perhaps
for immolating human victims, and one or two
of the brazen implements called Celts, the purpose
of which has troubled the repose of so many antiquaries.
A variety of other articles, some of which
had neither name nor were capable of description,
lay in confusion about the apartment; and in one
corner, on a quantity of withered sea-weed, reposed
what seemed, at first view, to be a large unshapely
dog, but, when seen more closely, proved to be a
tame seal, which it had been Norna’s amusement to
domesticate.</p>
<p>This uncouth favourite bristled up in its corner,
upon the arrival of so many strangers, with an alertness
similar to that which a terrestrial dog would
have displayed on a similar occasion; but Norna
remained motionless, seated behind a table of rough
granite, propped up by misshapen feet of the same
material, which, besides the old book with which she
seemed to be busied, sustained a cake of the coarse
unleavened bread, three parts oatmeal, and one the
sawdust of fir, which is used by the poor peasants
of Norway, beside which stood a jar of water.</p>
<p>Magnus Troil remained a minute in silence gazing
upon his kinswoman, while the singularity of
her mansion inspired Brenda with much fear, and
changed, though but for a moment, the melancholy
and abstracted mood of Minna, into a feeling of interest
not unmixed with awe. The silence was interrupted
by the Udaller, who, unwilling on the one
hand to give his kinswoman offence, and desirous on
the other to show that he was not daunted by a reception
so singular, opened the conversation thus:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>—</p>
<p>“I give you good e’en, cousin Norna—my daughters
and I have come far to see you.”</p>
<p>Norna raised her eyes from her volume, looked
full at her visitors, then let them quietly sit down
on the leaf with which she seemed to be engaged.</p>
<p>“Nay, cousin,” said Magnus, “take your own time—our
business with you can wait your leisure.—See
here, Minna, what a fair prospect here is of the
cape, scarce a quarter of a mile off! you may see the
billows breaking on it topmast high. Our kinswoman
has got a pretty seal, too—Here, sealchie,
my man, whew, whew!”</p>
<p>The seal took no further notice of the Udaller’s
advances to acquaintance, than by uttering a low
growl.</p>
<p>“He is not so well trained,” continued the Udaller,
affecting an air of ease and unconcern, “as
Peter MacRaw’s, the old piper of Stornoway, who
had a seal that flapped its tail to the tune of <i>Caberfae</i>,
and acknowledged no other whatever.<a id="FNanchor2_20_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_20_24">[20]</a>—Well,
cousin,” he concluded, observing that Norna closed
her book, “are you going to give us a welcome at
last, or must we go farther than our blood-relation’s
house to seek one, and that when the evening is
wearing late apace?”</p>
<p>“Ye dull and hard-hearted generation, as deaf as
the adder to the voice of the charmer,” answered
Norna, addressing them, “why come ye to me? You
have slighted every warning I could give of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
coming harm, and now that it hath come upon you,
ye seek my counsel when it can avail you nothing.”</p>
<p>“Look you, kinswoman,” said the Udaller, with
his usual frankness, and boldness of manner and accent,
“I must needs tell you that your courtesy is
something of the coarsest and the coldest. I cannot
say that I ever saw an adder, in regard there are
none in these parts; but touching my own thoughts
of what such a thing may be, it cannot be termed a
suitable comparison to me or to my daughters, and
that I would have you to know. For old acquaintance,
and certain other reasons, I do not leave your
house upon the instant; but as I came hither in all
kindness and civility, so I pray you to receive me
with the like, otherwise we will depart, and leave
shame on your inhospitable threshold.”</p>
<p>“How,” said Norna, “dare you use such bold language
in the house of one from whom all men, from
whom you yourself, come to solicit counsel and aid?
They who speak to the Reimkennar, must lower
their voice to her before whom winds and waves
hush both blast and billow.”</p>
<p>“Blast and billow may hush themselves if they
will,” replied the peremptory Udaller, “but that will
not I. I speak in the house of my friend as in my
own, and strike sail to none.”</p>
<p>“And hope ye,” said Norna, “by this rudeness
to compel me to answer to your interrogatories?”</p>
<p>“Kinswoman,” replied Magnus Troil, “I know
not so much as you of the old Norse sagas; but
this I know, that when kempies were wont, long
since, to seek the habitations of the gall-dragons
and spae-women, they came with their axes on
their shoulders, and their good swords drawn in
their hands, and compelled the power whom they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
invoked to listen to and to answer them, ay were it
Odin himself.”</p>
<p>“Kinsman,” said Norna, arising from her seat,
and coming forward, “thou hast spoken well, and
in good time for thyself and thy daughters; for
hadst thou turned from my threshold without extorting
an answer, morning’s sun had never again
shone upon you. The spirits who serve me are
jealous, and will not be employed in aught that
may benefit humanity, unless their service is commanded
by the undaunted importunity of the brave
and the free. And now speak, what wouldst thou
have of me?”</p>
<p>“My daughter’s health,” replied Magnus, “which
no remedies have been able to restore.”</p>
<p>“Thy daughter’s health?” answered Norna; “and
what is the maiden’s ailment?”</p>
<p>“The physician,” said Troil, “must name the
disease. All that I can tell thee of it is”——</p>
<p>“Be silent,” said Norna, interrupting him, “I
know all thou canst tell me, and more than thou
thyself knowest. Sit down, all of you—and thou,
maiden,” she said, addressing Minna, “sit thou in
that chair,” pointing to the place she had just left,
“once the seat of Giervada, at whose voice the
stars hid their beams, and the moon herself grew
pale.”</p>
<p>Minna moved with slow and tremulous step towards
the rude seat thus indicated to her. It was
composed of stone, formed into some semblance of
a chair by the rough and unskilful hand of some
ancient Gothic artist.</p>
<p>Brenda, creeping as close as possible to her father,
seated herself along with him upon a bench at some
distance from Minna, and kept her eyes, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
mixture of fear, pity, and anxiety, closely fixed upon
her. It would be difficult altogether to decipher
the emotions by which this amiable and affectionate
girl was agitated at the moment. Deficient in
her sister’s predominating quality of high imagination,
and little credulous, of course, to the marvellous,
she could not but entertain some vague and
indefinite fears on her own account, concerning the
nature of the scene which was soon to take place.
But these were in a manner swallowed up in her
apprehensions on the score of her sister, who, with
a frame so much weakened, spirits so much exhausted,
and a mind so susceptible of the impressions
which all around her was calculated to excite,
now sat pensively resigned to the agency of one,
whose treatment might produce the most baneful
effects upon such a subject.</p>
<p>Brenda gazed at Minna, who sat in that rude
chair of dark stone, her finely formed shape and
limbs making the strongest contrast with its ponderous
and irregular angles, her cheek and lips as
pale as clay, and her eyes turned upward, and
lighted with the mixture of resignation and excited
enthusiasm, which belonged to her disease
and her character. The younger sister then looked
on Norna, who muttered to herself in a low monotonous
manner, as, gliding from one place to another,
she collected different articles, which she placed one
by one on the table. And lastly, Brenda looked
anxiously to her father, to gather, if possible, from
his countenance, whether he entertained any part of
her own fears for the consequences of the scene
which was to ensue, considering the state of Minna’s
health and spirits. But Magnus Troil seemed
to have no such apprehensions; he viewed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
stern composure Norna’s preparations, and appeared
to wait the event with the composure of one, who,
confiding in the skill of a medical artist, sees him
preparing to enter upon some important and painful
operation, in the issue of which he is interested by
friendship or by affection.</p>
<p>Norna, meanwhile, went onward with her preparations,
until she had placed on the stone table
a variety of miscellaneous articles, and among the
rest, a small chafing-dish full of charcoal, a crucible,
and a piece of thin sheet-lead. She then spoke
aloud—“It is well that I was aware of your coming
hither—ay, long before you yourself had resolved
it—how should I else have been prepared for that
which is now to be done?—Maiden,” she continued,
addressing Minna, “where lies thy pain?”</p>
<p>The patient answered, by pressing her hand to the
left side of her bosom.</p>
<p>“Even so,” replied Norna, “even so—’tis the
site of weal or woe.—And you, her father and her
sister, think not this the idle speech of one who
talks by guess—if I can tell thee ill, it may be that
I shall be able to render that less severe, which may
not, by any aid, be wholly amended.—The heart—ay,
the heart—touch that, and the eye grows dim,
the pulse fails, the wholesome stream of our blood
is choked and troubled, our limbs decay like sapless
sea-weed in a summer’s sun; our better views of
existence are past and gone; what remains is the
dream of lost happiness, or the fear of inevitable
evil. But the Reimkennar must to her work—well
it is that I have prepared the means.”</p>
<p>She threw off her long dark-coloured mantle, and
stood before them in her short jacket of light-blue
wadmaal, with its skirt of the same stuff, fancifully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
embroidered with black velvet, and bound at the
waist with a chain or girdle of silver, formed into
singular devices. Norna next undid the fillet which
bound her grizzled hair, and shaking her head wildly,
caused it to fall in dishevelled abundance over her
face and around her shoulders, so as almost entirely
to hide her features. She then placed a small
crucible on the chafing-dish already mentioned,—dropped
a few drops from a vial on the charcoal below,—pointed
towards it her wrinkled forefinger,
which she had previously moistened with liquid from
another small bottle, and said with a deep voice,
“Fire, do thy duty;”—and the words were no sooner
spoken, than, probably by some chemical combination
of which the spectators were not aware, the
charcoal which was under the crucible became
slowly ignited; while Norna, as if impatient of
the delay, threw hastily back her disordered tresses,
and, while her features reflected the sparkles and
red light of the fire, and her eyes flashed from
amongst her hair like those of a wild animal from its
cover, blew fiercely till the whole was in an intense
glow. She paused a moment from her toil, and
muttering that the elemental spirit must be thanked,
recited, in her usual monotonous, yet wild mode of
chanting, the following verses:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Thou so needful, yet so dread,<br>
With cloudy crest, and wing of red;<br>
Thou, without whose genial breath<br>
The North would sleep the sleep of death;<br>
Who deign’st to warm the cottage hearth,<br>
Yet hurl’st proud palaces to earth,—<br>
Brightest, keenest of the Powers,<br>
Which form and rule this world of ours,<br>
With my rhyme of Runic, I<br>
Thank thee for thy agency.”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>She then severed a portion from the small mass
of sheet-lead which lay upon the table, and, placing
it in the crucible, subjected it to the action of the
lighted charcoal, and, as it melted, she sung,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Old Reimkennar, to thy art<br>
Mother Hertha sends her part;<br>
She, whose gracious bounty gives<br>
Needful food for all that lives.<br>
From the deep mine of the North,<br>
Came the mystic metal forth,<br>
Doom’d, amidst disjointed stones,<br>
Long to cere a champion’s bones,<br>
Disinhumed my charms to aid—<br>
Mother Earth, my thanks are paid.”<br>
</p>
<p>She then poured out some water from the jar into
a large cup, or goblet, and sung once more, as she
slowly stirred it round with the end of her staff:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Girdle of our islands dear,<br>
Element of Water, hear<br>
Thou whose power can overwhelm<br>
Broken mounds and ruin’d realm<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the lowly Belgian strand;</span><br>
All thy fiercest rage can never<br>
Of our soil a furlong sever<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From our rock-defended land;</span><br>
Play then gently thou thy part,<br>
To assist old Norna’s art.”<br>
</p>
<p>She then, with a pair of pincers, removed the
crucible from the chafing-dish, and poured the lead,
now entirely melted, into the bowl of water, repeating
at the same time,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Elements, each other greeting,<br>
Gifts and powers attend your meeting!”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>The melted lead, spattering as it fell into the
water, formed, of course, the usual combination of
irregular forms which is familiar to all who in childhood
have made the experiment, and from which,
according to our childish fancy, we may have selected
portions bearing some resemblance to domestic articles—the
tools of mechanics, or the like. Norna
seemed to busy herself in some such researches, for
she examined the mass of lead with scrupulous
attention, and detached it into different portions,
without apparently being able to find a fragment in
the form which she desired.</p>
<p>At length she again muttered, rather as speaking
to herself than to her guests, “He, the Viewless,
will not be omitted,—he will have his tribute
even in the work to which he gives nothing.—Stern
compeller of the clouds, thou also shalt hear the
voice of the Reimkennar.”</p>
<p>Thus speaking, Norna once more threw the lead
into the crucible, where, hissing and spattering as
the wet metal touched the sides of the red-hot vessel,
it was soon again reduced into a state of fusion.
The sibyl meantime turned to a corner of the apartment,
and opening suddenly a window which looked
to the north-west, let in the fitful radiance of the
sun, now lying almost level upon a great mass of
red clouds, which, boding future tempest, occupied
the edge of the horizon, and seemed to brood over
the billows of the boundless sea. Turning to this
quarter, from which a low hollow moaning breeze
then blew, Norna addressed the Spirit of the Winds,
in tones which seemed to resemble his own:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Thou, that over billows dark<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Safely send’st the fisher’s bark,—<br>
Giving him a path and motion<br>
Through the wilderness of ocean;<br>
Thou, that when the billows brave ye,<br>
O’er the shelves canst drive the navy,—<br>
Did’st thou chafe as one neglected,<br>
While thy brethren were respected?<br>
To appease thee, see, I tear<br>
This full grasp of grizzled hair;<br>
Oft thy breath hath through it sung,<br>
Softening to my magic tongue,—<br>
Now, ’tis thine to bid it fly<br>
Through the wide expanse of sky,<br>
’Mid the countless swarms to sail<br>
Of wild-fowl wheeling on thy gale;<br>
Take thy portion and rejoice,—<br>
Spirit, thou hast heard my voice!”<br>
</p>
<p>Norna accompanied these words with the action
which they described, tearing a handful of hair with
vehemence from her head, and strewing it upon the
wind as she continued her recitation. She then shut
the casement, and again involved the chamber in the
dubious twilight, which best suited her character
and occupation. The melted lead was once more
emptied into the water, and the various whimsical
conformations which it received from the operation
were examined with great care by the sibyl, who
at length seemed to intimate, by voice and gesture,
that her spell had been successful. She selected
from the fused metal a piece about the size of a
small nut, bearing in shape a close resemblance to
that of the human heart, and, approaching Minna,
again spoke in song:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“She who sits by haunted well,<br>
Is subject to the Nixie’s spell;<br>
She who walks on lonely beach<br>
To the Mermaid’s charmed speech;<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>She who walks round ring of green,<br>
Offends the peevish Fairy Queen;<br>
And she who takes rest in the Dwarfie’s cave,<br>
A weary weird of woe shall have.<br>
<br>
“By ring, by spring, by cave, by shore,<br>
Minna Troil has braved all this and more:<br>
And yet hath the root of her sorrow and ill<br>
A source that’s more deep and more mystical still.”<br>
</p>
<p>Minna, whose attention had been latterly something
disturbed by reflections on her own secret sorrow,
now suddenly recalled it, and looked eagerly
on Norna as if she expected to learn from her
rhymes something of deep interest. The northern
sibyl, meanwhile, proceeded to pierce the piece of
lead, which bore the form of a heart, and to fix in it
a piece of gold wire, by which it might be attached
to a chain or necklace. She then proceeded in her
rhyme,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Thou art within a demon’s hold,<br>
More wise than Heims, more strong than Trolld;<br>
No siren sings so sweet as he,—<br>
No fay springs lighter on the lea;<br>
No elfin power hath half the art<br>
To soothe, to move, to wring the heart,—<br>
Life-blood from the cheek to drain,<br>
Drench the eye, and dry the vein.<br>
Maiden, ere we farther go,<br>
Dost thou note me, ay or no?”<br>
</p>
<p>Minna replied in the same rhythmical manner,
which, in jest and earnest, was frequently used by
the ancient Scandinavians,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“I mark thee, my mother, both word, look, and sign;<br>
Speak on with the riddle—to read it be mine.”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>“Now, Heaven and every saint be praised!” said
Magnus; “they are the first words to the purpose
which she hath spoken these many days.”</p>
<p>“And they are the last which she shall speak for
many a month,” said Norna, incensed at the interruption,
“if you again break the progress of my
spell. Turn your faces to the wall, and look not
hitherward again, under penalty of my severe displeasure.
You, Magnus Troil, from hard-hearted
audacity of spirit, and you, Brenda, from wanton
and idle disbelief in that which is beyond your
bounded comprehension, are unworthy to look on
this mystic work; and the glance of your eyes
mingles with, and weakens, the spell; for the
powers cannot brook distrust.”</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to be addressed in a tone so
peremptory, Magnus would have made some
angry reply; but reflecting that the health of
Minna was at stake, and considering that she
who spoke was a woman of many sorrows, he suppressed
his anger, bowed his head, shrugged his
shoulders, assumed the prescribed posture, averting
his head from the table, and turning towards the
wall. Brenda did the same, on receiving a sign
from her father, and both remained profoundly
silent.</p>
<p>Norna then addressed Minna once more,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Mark me! for the word I speak<br>
Shall bring the colour to thy cheek.<br>
This leaden heart, so light of cost,<br>
The symbol of a treasure lost,<br>
Thou shalt wear in hope and in peace,<br>
That the cause of your sickness and sorrow may cease,<br>
When crimson foot meets crimson hand<br>
In the Martyrs’ Aisle, and in Orkney-land.”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>Minna coloured deeply at the last couplet, intimating,
as she failed not to interpret it, that Norna
was completely acquainted with the secret cause of
her sorrow. The same conviction led the maiden to
hope in the favourable issue, which the sibyl seemed
to prophesy; and not venturing to express her feelings
in any manner more intelligible, she pressed
Norna’s withered hand with all the warmth of affection,
first to her breast and then to her bosom, bedewing
it at the same time with her tears.</p>
<p>With more of human feeling than she usually exhibited,
Norna extricated her hand from the grasp
of the poor girl, whose tears now flowed freely,
and then, with more tenderness of manner than
she had yet shown, she knotted the leaden heart
to a chain of gold, and hung it around Minna’s
neck, singing, as she performed that last branch
of the spell,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Be patient, be patient, for Patience hath power<br>
To ward us in danger, like mantle in shower;<br>
A fairy gift you best may hold<br>
In a chain of fairy gold;<br>
The chain and the gift are each a true token,<br>
That not without warrant old Norna has spoken;<br>
But thy nearest and dearest must never behold them,<br>
Till time shall accomplish the truths I have told them.”<br>
</p>
<p>The verses being concluded, Norna carefully arranged
the chain around her patient’s neck so as to
hide it in her bosom, and thus ended the spell—a
spell which, at the moment I record these incidents,
it is known, has been lately practised in Zetland,
where any decline of health, without apparent cause,
is imputed by the lower orders to a demon having
stolen the heart from the body of the patient, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
where the experiment of supplying the deprivation
by a leaden one, prepared in the manner described,
has been resorted to within these few years. In a
metaphorical sense, the disease may be considered
as a general one in all parts of the world; but, as
this simple and original remedy is peculiar to the
isles of Thule, it were unpardonable not to preserve
it at length, in a narrative connected with Scottish
antiquities.<a id="FNanchor2_21_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_21_25">[21]</a></p>
<p>A second time Norna reminded her patient, that
if she showed, or spoke of, the fairy gifts, their
virtue would be lost—a belief so common as to
be received into the superstitions of all nations.
Lastly, unbuttoning the collar which she had just
fastened, she showed her a link of the gold chain,
which Minna instantly recognised as that formerly
given by Norna to Mordaunt Mertoun. This seemed
to intimate he was yet alive, and under Norna’s protection;
and she gazed on her with the most eager
curiosity. But the sibyl imposed her finger on her
lips in token of silence, and a second time involved
the chain in those folds which modestly and closely
veiled one of the most beautiful, as well as one of
the kindest, bosoms in the world.</p>
<p>Norna then extinguished the lighted charcoal, and,
as the water hissed upon the glowing embers, commanded
Magnus and Brenda to look around, and
behold her task accomplished.</p>

</p>
<p>It seemed as if Norna had indeed full right to claim
the gratitude of the Udaller for the improved condition
of his daughter’s health. She once more
threw open the window, and Minna, drying her
eyes and advancing with affectionate confidence,
threw herself on her father’s neck, and asked his
forgiveness for the trouble she had of late occasioned
to him. It is unnecessary to add, that this
was at once granted, with a full, though rough burst
of parental tenderness, and as many close embraces
as if his child had been just rescued from the
jaws of death. When Magnus had dismissed Minna
from his arms, to throw herself into those of her
sister, and express to her, rather by kisses and tears
than in words, the regret she entertained for her
late wayward conduct, the Udaller thought proper,
in the meantime, to pay his thanks to their hostess,
whose skill had proved so efficacious. But scarce
had he come out with, “Much respected kinswoman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
I am but a plain old Norseman,”—when she interrupted
him, by pressing her finger on her lips.</p>
<p>“There are those around us,” she said, “who
must hear no mortal voice, witness no sacrifice to
mortal feelings—there are times when they mutiny
even against me, their sovereign mistress, because I
am still shrouded in the flesh of humanity. Fear,
therefore, and be silent. I, whose deeds have raised
me from the low-sheltered valley of life, where dwell
its social wants and common charities;—I, who
have bereft the Giver of the Gift which he gave,
and stand alone on a cliff of immeasurable height,
detached from earth, save from the small portion
that supports my miserable tread—I alone am fit
to cope with those sullen mates. Fear not, therefore,
but yet be not too bold, and let this night to
you be one of fasting and of prayer.”</p>
<p>If the Udaller had not, before the commencement
of the operation, been disposed to dispute the commands
of the sibyl, it may be well believed he was
less so now, that it had terminated to all appearance
so fortunately. So he sat down in silence, and
seized upon a volume which lay near him as a sort
of desperate effort to divert ennui, for on no other
occasion had Magnus been known to have recourse
to a book for that purpose. It chanced to be a book
much to his mind, being the well-known work of
Olaus Magnus, upon the manners of the ancient
Northern nations. The book is unluckily in the
Latin language, and the Danske or Dutch were,
either of them, much more familiar to the Udaller.
But then it was the fine edition published in 1555,
which contains representations of the war-chariots,
fishing exploits, warlike exercises, and domestic employments
of the Scandinavians, executed on copper-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>plates;
and thus the information which the work
refused to the understanding, was addressed to the
eye, which, as is well known both to old and young,
answers the purpose of amusement as well, if not
better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two sisters, pressed as close to
each other as two flowers on the same stalk, sat
with their arms reciprocally passed over each other’s
shoulder, as if they feared some new and unforeseen
cause of coldness was about to separate them, and
interrupt the sister-like harmony which had been
but just restored. Norna sat opposite to them,
sometimes revolving the large parchment volume
with which they had found her employed at their
entrance, and sometimes gazing on the sisters with
a fixed look, in which an interest of a kind unusually
tender, seemed occasionally to disturb the stern
and rigorous solemnity of her countenance. All was
still and silent as death, and the subsiding emotions
of Brenda had not yet permitted her to wonder
whether the remaining hours of the evening were
to be passed in the same manner, when the scene of
tranquillity was suddenly interrupted by the entrance
of the dwarf Pacolet, or, as the Udaller called
him, Nicholas Strumpfer.</p>
<p>Norna darted an angry glance on the intruder,
who seemed to deprecate her resentment by holding
up his hands and uttering a babbling sound; then,
instantly resorting to his usual mode of conversation,
he expressed himself by a variety of signs
made rapidly upon his fingers, and as rapidly answered
by his mistress, so that the young women,
who had never heard of such an art, and now saw it
practised by two beings so singular, almost conceived
their mutual intelligence the work of en<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>chantment.
When they had ceased their intercourse,
Norna turned to Magnus Troil with much haughtiness,
and said, “How, my kinsman? have you so
far forgot yourself, as to bring earthly food into the
house of the Reimkennar, and make preparations in
the dwelling of Power and of Despair, for refection,
and wassail, and revelry?—Speak not—answer
not,” she said; “the duration of the cure which was
wrought even now, depends on your silence and
obedience—bandy but a single look or word with
me, and the latter condition of that maiden shall be
worse than the first!”</p>
<p>This threat was an effectual charm upon the
tongue of the Udaller, though he longed to indulge
it in vindication of his conduct.</p>
<p>“Follow me, all of you,” said Norna, striding to
the door of the apartment, “and see that no one
looks backwards—we leave not this apartment
empty, though we, the children of mortality, be removed
from it.”</p>
<p>She went out, and the Udaller signed to his
daughters to follow, and to obey her injunctions.
The sibyl moved swifter than her guests down the
rude descent, (such it might rather be termed, than
a proper staircase,) which led to the lower apartment.
Magnus and his daughters, when they entered
the chamber, found their own attendants
aghast at the presence and proceedings of Norna of
the Fitful-head.</p>
<p>They had been previously employed in arranging
the provisions which they had brought along with
them, so as to present a comfortable cold meal, as
soon as the appetite of the Udaller, which was as
regular as the return of tide, should induce him to
desire some refreshment; and now they stood star<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ing
in fear and surprise, while Norna, seizing upon
one article after another, and well supported by the
zealous activity of Pacolet, flung their whole preparations
out of the rude aperture which served
for a window, and over the cliff, from which the
ancient Burgh arose, into the ocean, which raged
and foamed beneath. <i>Vifda</i>, (dried beef,) hams, and
pickled pork, flew after each other into empty space,
smoked geese were restored to the air, and cured
fish to the sea, their native elements indeed, but
which they were no longer capable of traversing;
and the devastation proceeded so rapidly, that the
Udaller could scarce secure from the wreck his silver
drinking cup; while the large leathern flask of
brandy, which was destined to supply his favourite
beverage, was sent to follow the rest of the supper,
by the hands of Pacolet, who regarded, at the same
time, the disappointed Udaller with a malicious
grin, as if, notwithstanding his own natural taste
for the liquor, he enjoyed the disappointment and
surprise of Magnus Troil still more than he would
have relished sharing his enjoyment.</p>
<p>The destruction of the brandy flask exhausted
the patience of Magnus, who roared out, in a tone
of no small displeasure, “Why, kinswoman, this
is wasteful madness—where, and on what, would
you have us sup?”</p>
<p>“Where you will,” answered Norna, “and on
what you will—but not in my dwelling, and not
on the food with which you have profaned it. Vex
my spirit no more, but begone every one of you!
You have been here too long for my good, perhaps
for your own.”</p>
<p>“How, kinswoman,” said Magnus, “would you
make outcasts of us at this time of night, when even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a Scotchman would not turn a stranger from the
door?—Bethink you, dame, it is shame on our
lineage for ever, if this squall of yours should force
us to slip cables, and go to sea so scantily
provided.”</p>
<p>“Be silent, and depart,” said Norna; “let it suffice
you have got that for which you came. I have
no harbourage for mortal guests, no provision to
relieve human wants. There is beneath the cliff, a
beach of the finest sand, a stream of water as pure
as the well of Kildinguie, and the rocks bear dulse
as wholesome as that of Guiodin; and well you wot,
that the well of Kildinguie and the dulse of Guiodin
will cure all maladies save Black Death.”<a id="FNanchor2_22_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_22_26">[22]</a></p>
<p>“And well I wot,” said the Udaller, “that I
would eat corrupted sea-weeds like a starling, or
salted seal’s flesh like the men of Burraforth, or
wilks, buckies, and lampits, like the poor sneaks
of Stroma, rather than break wheat bread and drink
red wine in a house where it is begrudged me.—And
yet,” he said, checking himself, “I am wrong,
very wrong, my cousin, to speak thus to you, and I
should rather thank you for what you have done,
than upbraid you for following your own ways.
But I see you are impatient—we will be all under
way presently.—And you, ye knaves,” addressing
his servants, “that were in such hurry with your
service before it was lacked, get out of doors with
you presently, and manage to catch the ponies; for
I see we must make for another harbour to-night,
if we would not sleep with an empty stomach, and
on a hard bed.”</p>
<p>The domestics of Magnus, already sufficiently
alarmed at the violence of Norna’s conduct, scarce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
waited the imperious command of their master to
evacuate her dwelling with all dispatch; and the
Udaller, with a daughter on each arm, was in the
act of following them, when Norna said emphatically,
“Stop!” They obeyed, and again turned
towards her. She held out her hand to Magnus,
which the placable Udaller instantly folded in his
own ample palm.</p>
<p>“Magnus,” she said, “we part by necessity, but,
I trust, not in anger?”</p>
<p>“Surely not, cousin,” said the warm-hearted
Udaller, wellnigh stammering in his hasty disclamation
of all unkindness,—“most assuredly not.
I never bear ill-will to any one, much less to one
of my own blood, and who has piloted me with her
advice through many a rough tide, as I would pilot
a boat betwixt Swona and Stroma, through all the
waws, wells, and swelchies of the Pentland Frith.”</p>
<p>“Enough,” said Norna, “and now farewell, with
such a blessing as I dare bestow—not a word
more!—Maidens,” she added, “draw near, and let
me kiss your brows.”</p>
<p>The sibyl was obeyed by Minna with awe, and
by Brenda with fear; the one overmastered by the
warmth of her imagination, the other by the natural
timidity of her constitution. Norna then dismissed
them, and in two minutes afterwards they
found themselves beyond the bridge, and standing
upon the rocky platform in front of the ancient
Pictish Burgh, which it was the pleasure of this sequestered
female to inhabit. The night, for it was
now fallen, was unusually serene. A bright twilight,
which glimmered far over the surface of the sea,
supplied the brief absence of the summer’s sun;
and the waves seemed to sleep under its influence, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
faint and slumberous was the sound with which one
after another rolled on and burst against the foot
of the cliff on which they stood. In front of them
stood the rugged fortress, seeming, in the uniform
greyness of the atmosphere, as aged, as shapeless,
and as massive, as the rock on which it was founded.
There was neither sight nor sound that indicated
human habitation, save that from one rude shot-hole
glimmered the flame of the feeble lamp by
which the sibyl was probably pursuing her mystical
and nocturnal studies, shooting upon the twilight,
in which it was soon lost and confounded, a single
line of tiny light; bearing the same proportion to
that of the atmosphere, as the aged woman and her
serf, the sole inhabitants of that desert, did to the
solitude with which they were surrounded.</p>
<p>For several minutes, the party, thus suddenly and
unexpectedly expelled from the shelter where they
had reckoned upon spending the night, stood in
silence, each wrapt in their own separate reflections.
Minna, her thoughts fixed on the mystical consolation
which she had received, in vain endeavoured
to extract from the words of Norna a more distinct
and intelligible meaning; and the Udaller had not
yet recovered his surprise at the extrusion to which
he had been thus whimsically subjected, under circumstances
that prohibited him from resenting as
an insult, treatment, which, in all other respects, was
so shocking to the genial hospitality of his nature,
that he still felt like one disposed to be angry, if he
but knew how to set about it. Brenda was the first
who brought matters to a point, by asking whither
they were to go, and how they were to spend the
night? The question, which was asked in a tone,
that, amidst its simplicity, had something dolorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
in it, entirely changed the train of her father’s ideas;
and the unexpected perplexity of their situation now
striking him in a comic point of view, he laughed
till his very eyes ran over, while every rock around
him rang, and the sleeping sea-fowl were startled
from their repose, by the loud, hearty explosions of
his obstreperous hilarity.</p>
<p>The Udaller’s daughters, eagerly representing to
their father the risk of displeasing Norna by this
unlimited indulgence of his mirth, united their
efforts to drag him to a farther distance from her
dwelling. Magnus, yielding to their strength,
which, feeble as it was, his own fit of laughter rendered
him incapable of resisting, suffered himself to
be pulled to a considerable distance from the Burgh,
and then escaping from their hands, and sitting
down, or rather suffering himself to drop, upon a
large stone which lay conveniently by the wayside,
he again laughed so long and lustily, that his vexed
and anxious daughters became afraid that there
was something more than natural in these repeated
convulsions.</p>
<p>At length his mirth exhausted both itself and the
Udaller’s strength. He groaned heavily, wiped his
eyes, and said, not without feeling some desire to
renew his obstreperous cachinnation, “Now, by the
bones of Saint Magnus, my ancestor and namesake,
one would imagine that being turned out of doors,
at this time of night, was nothing short of an absolutely
exquisite jest; for I have shaken my sides at
it till they ache. There we sat, made snug for the
night, and I made as sure of a good supper and a
can as ever I had been of either,—and here we are
all taken aback! and then poor Brenda’s doleful
voice, and melancholy question, of ‘What is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
done, and where are we to sleep?’ In good faith,
unless one of those knaves, who must needs torment
the poor woman by their trencher-work before it
was wanted, can make amends by telling us of some
snug port under our lee, we have no other course
for it but to steer through the twilight on the bearing
of Burgh-Westra, and rough it out as well as
we can by the way. I am sorry but for you, girls;
for many a cruize have I been upon when we were
on shorter allowance than we are like to have now.—I
would I had but secured a morsel for you, and
a drop for myself; and then there had been but
little to complain of.”</p>
<p>Both sisters hastened to assure the Udaller that
they felt not the least occasion for food.</p>
<p>“Why, that is well,” said Magnus: “and so
being the case, I will not complain of my own appetite,
though it is sharper than convenient. And
the rascal, Nicholas Strumpfer,—what a leer the
villain gave me as he started the good Nantz into
the salt-water! He grinned, the knave, like a seal
on a skerry.—Had it not been for vexing my
poor kinswoman Norna, I would have sent his
misbegotten body, and misshapen jolterhead, after
my bonny flask, as sure as Saint Magnus lies at
Kirkwall!”</p>
<p>By this time the servants returned with the
ponies, which they had very soon caught—these
sensible animals finding nothing so captivating in
the pastures where they had been suffered to stray,
as inclined them to resist the invitation again to
subject themselves to saddle and bridle. The prospects
of the party were also considerably improved
by learning that the contents of their sumpter-pony’s
burden had not been entirely exhausted,—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
small basket having fortunately escaped the rage of
Norna and Pacolet, by the rapidity with which one
of the servants had caught up and removed it. The
same domestic, an alert and ready-witted fellow,
had observed upon the beach, not above three miles
distant from the Burgh, and about a quarter of a mile
off their straight path, a deserted <i>Skio</i>, or fisherman’s
hut, and suggested that they should occupy
it for the rest of the night, in order that the ponies
might be refreshed, and the young ladies spend the
night under cover from the raw evening air.</p>
<p>When we are delivered from great and serious
dangers, our mood is, or ought to be, grave, in proportion
to the peril we have escaped, and the gratitude
due to protecting Providence. But few things
raise the spirits more naturally, or more harmlessly,
than when means of extrication from any of the
lesser embarrassments of life are suddenly presented
to us; and such was the case in the present instance.
The Udaller, relieved from the apprehensions
for his daughters suffering from fatigue, and
himself from too much appetite and too little food,
carolled Norse ditties, as he spurred Bergen through
the twilight, with as much glee and gallantry as if
the night-ride had been entirely a matter of his own
free choice. Brenda lent her voice to some of his
choruses, which were echoed in ruder notes by the
servants, who, in that simple state of society, were
not considered as guilty of any breach of respect
by mingling their voices with the song. Minna, indeed,
was as yet unequal to such an effort; but she
compelled herself to assume some share in the general
hilarity of the meeting; and, contrary to her
conduct since the fatal morning which concluded
the Festival of Saint John, she seemed to take her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
usual interest in what was going on around her, and
answered with kindness and readiness the repeated
enquiries concerning her health, with which the
Udaller every now and then interrupted his carol.
And thus they proceeded by night, a happier party
by far than they had been when they traced the
same route on the preceding morning, making light
of the difficulties of the way, and promising themselves
shelter and a comfortable night’s rest in the
deserted hut which they were now about to approach,
and which they expected to find in a state
of darkness and solitude.</p>
<p>But it was the lot of the Udaller that day to be
deceived more than once in his calculations.</p>
<p>“And which way lies this cabin of yours, Laurie?”
said the Udaller, addressing the intelligent
domestic of whom we just spoke.</p>
<p>“Yonder it should be,” said Laurence Scholey,
“at the head of the voe—but, by my faith, if it be
the place, there are folk there before us—God and
Saint Ronan send that they be canny company!”</p>
<p>In truth there was a light in the deserted hut,
strong enough to glimmer through every chink of
the shingles and wreck-wood of which it was constructed,
and to give the whole cabin the appearance
of a smithy seen by night. The universal
superstition of the Zetlanders seized upon Magnus
and his escort.</p>
<p>“They are trows,” said one voice.</p>
<p>“They are witches,” murmured another.</p>
<p>“They are mermaids,” muttered a third; “only
hear their wild singing!”</p>
<p>All stopped; and, in effect, some notes of music
were audible, which Brenda, with a voice that
quivered a little, but yet had a turn of arch ridi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>cule
in its tone, pronounced to be the sound of a
fiddle.</p>
<p>“Fiddle or fiend,” said the Udaller, who, if he
believed in such nightly apparitions as had struck
terror into his retinue, certainly feared them not—“fiddle
or fiend, may the devil fetch me if a witch
cheats me out of supper to-night, for the second
time!”</p>
<p>So saying, he dismounted, clenched his trusty
truncheon in his hand, and advanced towards the
hut, followed by Laurence alone; the rest of his
retinue continuing stationary on the beach beside
his daughters and the ponies.</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>The stride of the Udaller relaxed nothing of its
length or of its firmness as he approached the glimmering
cabin, from which he now heard distinctly
the sound of the fiddle. But, if still long and firm,
his steps succeeded each other rather more slowly
than usual; for, like a cautious, though a brave
general, Magnus was willing to reconnoitre his
enemy before assailing him. The trusty Laurence
Scholey, who kept close behind his master, now
whispered into his ear, “So help me, sir, as I believe
that the ghaist, if ghaist it be, that plays so bravely
on the fiddle, must be the ghaist of Maister Claud
Halcro, or his wraith at least; for never was bow
drawn across thairm which brought out the gude
auld spring of ‘Fair and Lucky,’ so like his ain.”</p>
<p>Magnus was himself much of the same opinion;
for he knew the blithe minstrelsy of the spirited
little old man, and hailed the hut with a hearty hilloah,
which was immediately replied to by the cheery
note of his ancient messmate, and Halcro himself
presently made his appearance on the beach.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>The Udaller now signed to his retinue to come
up, while he asked his friend, after a kind greeting
and much shaking of hands, “How the devil
he came to sit there, playing old tunes in so desolate
a place, like an owl whooping to the moon?”</p>
<p>“And tell me rather, Fowd,” said Claud Halcro,
“how you came to be within hearing of me? ay,
by my word, and with your bonny daughters, too?—Jarto
Minna and Jarto Brenda, I bid you welcome
to these yellow sands—and there shake hands,
as glorious John, or some other body, says, upon
the same occasion. And how came you here like
two fair swans, making day out of twilight, and
turning all you step upon to silver?”</p>
<p>“You shall know all about them presently,”
answered Magnus; “but what messmates have
you got in the hut with you? I think I hear some
one speaking.”</p>
<p>“None,” replied Claud Halcro, “but that poor
creature, the Factor, and my imp of a boy Giles.
I—but come in—come in—here you will find us
starving in comfort—not so much as a mouthful
of sour sillocks to be had for love or money.”</p>
<p>“That may be in a small part helped,” said the
Udaller; “for though the best of our supper is gone
over the Fitful Crags to the sealchies and the dog-fish,
yet we have got something in the kit still.—Here,
Laurie, bring up the <i>vifda</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Jokul, jokul!</i>”<a id="FNanchor2_23_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_23_27">[23]</a> was Laurence’s joyful answer;
and he hastened for the basket.</p>
<p>“By the bicker of Saint Magnus,”<a id="FNanchor2_24_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_24_28">[24]</a> said Halcro,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
“and the burliest bishop that ever quaffed it for
luck’s sake, there is no finding your locker empty,
Magnus! I believe sincerely that ere a friend
wanted, you could, like old Luggie the warlock, fish
up boiled and roasted out of the pool of Kibster.”<a id="FNanchor2_25_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_25_29">[25]</a></p>
<p>“You are wrong there, Jarto Claud,” said Magnus
Troil, “for far from helping me to a supper, the
foul fiend, I believe, has carried off great part of
mine this blessed evening; but you are welcome
to share and share of what is left.” This was said
while the party entered the hut.</p>
<p>Here, in a cabin which smelled strongly of dried
fish, and whose sides and roof were jet-black with
smoke, they found the unhappy Triptolemus Yellowley
seated beside a fire made of dried sea-weed,
mingled with some peats and wreck-wood; his sole
companion a barefooted, yellow-haired Zetland boy,
who acted occasionally as a kind of page to Claud
Halcro, bearing his fiddle on his shoulder, saddling
his pony, and rendering him similar duties of kindly
observance. The disconsolate agriculturist, for such
his visage betokened him, displayed little surprise,
and less animation, at the arrival of the Udaller and
his companions, until, after the party had drawn
close to the fire, (a neighbourhood which the dampness
of the night air rendered far from disagreeable,)
the pannier was opened, and a tolerable supply of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
barley-bread and hung beef, besides a flask of
brandy, (no doubt smaller than that which the relentless
hand of Pacolet had emptied into the
ocean,) gave assurances of a tolerable supper. Then,
indeed, the worthy Factor grinned, chuckled, rubbed
his hands, and enquired after all friends at Burgh-Westra.</p>
<p>When they had all partaken of this needful refreshment,
the Udaller repeated his enquiries of
Halcro, and more particularly of the Factor, how
they came to be nestled in such a remote corner
at such an hour of night.</p>
<p>“Maister Magnus Troil,” said Triptolemus, when
a second cup had given him spirits to tell his tale
of woe, “I would not have you think that it is a
little thing that disturbs me. I came of that grain
that takes a sair wind to shake it. I have seen
many a Martinmas and many a Whitsunday in my
day, whilk are the times peculiarly grievous to those
of my craft, and I could aye bide the bang; but
I think I am like to be dung ower a’thegither
in this damned country of yours—Gude forgie me
for swearing—but evil communication corrupteth
good manners.”</p>
<p>“Now, Heaven guide us,” said the Udaller, “what
is the matter with the man? Why, man, if you will
put your plough into new land, you must look to
have it hank on a stone now and then—You must
set us an example of patience, seeing you come here
for our improvement.”</p>
<p>“And the deil was in my feet when I did so,”
said the Factor; “I had better have set myself to
improve the cairn on Clochnaben.”</p>
<p>“But what is it, after all,” said the Udaller, “that
has befallen you?—what is it that you complain of?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Of every thing that has chanced to me since I
landed on this island, which I believe was accursed
at the very creation,” said the agriculturist, “and
assigned as a fitting station for sorners, thieves,
whores, (I beg the ladies’ pardon,) witches, bitches,
and all evil spirits!”</p>
<p>“By my faith, a goodly catalogue!” said Magnus;
“and there has been the day, that if I had
heard you give out the half of it, I should have
turned improver myself, and have tried to amend
your manners with a cudgel.”</p>
<p>“Bear with me,” said the Factor, “Maister Fowd,
or Maister Udaller, or whatever else they may call
you, and as you are strong be pitiful, and consider
the luckless lot of any inexperienced person who
lights upon this earthly paradise of yours. He asks
for drink, they bring him sour whey—no disparagement
to your brandy, Fowd, which is excellent—You
ask for meat, and they bring you sour sillocks
that Satan might choke upon—You call your
labourers together, and bid them work; it proves
Saint Magnus’s day, or Saint Ronan’s day, or some
infernal saint or other’s—or else, perhaps, they
have come out of bed with the wrong foot foremost,
or they have seen an owl, or a rabbit has crossed
their path, or they have dreamed of a roasted horse—in
short, nothing is to be done—Give them a
spade, and they work as if it burned their fingers;
but set them to dancing, and see when they will
tire of funking and flinging!”</p>
<p>“And why should they, poor bodies,” said Claud
Halcro, “as long as there are good fiddlers to play
to them?”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said Triptolemus, shaking his head,
“you are a proper person to uphold them in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
a humour. Well, to proceed:—I till a piece of
my best ground; down comes a sturdy beggar that
wants a kailyard, or a plant-a-cruive, as you call it,
and he claps down an enclosure in the middle of
my bit shot of corn, as lightly as if he was baith
laird and tenant; and gainsay him wha likes, there
he dibbles in his kail-plants! I sit down to my
sorrowful dinner, thinking to have peace and quietness
there at least; when in comes one, two, three,
four, or half-a-dozen of skelping long lads, from
some foolery or anither, misca’ me for barring my
ain door against them, and eat up the best half of
what my sister’s providence—and she is not over
bountiful—has allotted for my dinner! Then enters
a witch, with an ellwand in her hand, and she
raises the wind or lays it, whichever she likes,
majors up and down my house as if she was mistress
of it, and I am bounden to thank Heaven if
she carries not the broadside of it away with her!”</p>
<p>“Still,” said the Fowd, “this is no answer to my
question—how the foul fiend I come to find you at
moorings here?”</p>
<p>“Have patience, worthy sir,” replied the afflicted
Factor, “and listen to what I have to say, for I
fancy it will be as well to tell you the whole matter.
You must know, I once thought that I had
gotten a small godsend, that might have made all
these matters easier.”</p>
<p>“How! a godsend! Do you mean a wreck,
Master Factor?” exclaimed Magnus; “shame upon
you, that should have set example to others!”</p>
<p>“It was no wreck,” said the Factor; “but, if
you must needs know, it chanced that as I raised
an hearthstane in one of the old chambers at Stourburgh,
(for my sister is minded that there is little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
use in mair fire-places about a house than one, and
I wanted the stane to knock bear upon,) when,
what should I light on but a horn full of old coins,
silver the maist feck of them, but wi’ a bit sprinkling
of gold amang them too.<a id="FNanchor2_26_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_26_30">[26]</a> Weel, I thought this
was a dainty windfa’, and so thought Baby, and we
were the mair willing to put up with a place where
there were siccan braw nest-eggs—and we slade
down the stane cannily over the horn, which seemed
to me to be the very cornucopia, or horn of abundance;
and for further security, Baby wad visit
the room maybe twenty times in the day, and mysell
at an orra time, to the boot of a’ that.”</p>
<p>“On my word, and a very pretty amusement,”
said Claud Halcro, “to look over a horn of one’s
own siller. I question if glorious John Dryden
ever enjoyed such a pastime in his life—I am very
sure I never did.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you forget, Jarto Claud,” said the
Udaller, “that the Factor was only counting over
the money for my Lord the Chamberlain. As he is
so keen for his Lordship’s rights in whales and
wrecks, he would not surely forget him in treasure-trove.”</p>
<p>“A-hem! a-hem! a-he—he—hem!” ejaculated
Triptolemus, seized at the moment with an awkward
fit of coughing,—“no doubt, my Lord’s right
in the matter would have been considered, being in
the hand of one, though I say it, as just as can be
found in Angus-shire, let alone the Mearns. But
mark what happened of late! One day, as I went
up to see that all was safe and snug, and just to
count out the share that should have been his Lordship’s—for
surely the labourer, as one may call the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
finder, is worthy of his hire—nay, some learned men
say, that when the finder, in point of trust and in
point of power, representeth the <i>dominus</i>, or lord
superior, he taketh the whole; but let that pass, as
a kittle question <i>in apicibus juris</i>, as we wont to
say at Saint Andrews—Well, sir and ladies, when
I went to the upper chamber, what should I see but
an ugsome, ill-shaped, and most uncouth dwarf, that
wanted but hoofs and horns to have made an utter
devil of him, counting over the very hornful of
siller! I am no timorous man, Master Fowd, but,
judging that I should proceed with caution in such
a matter—for I had reason to believe that there was
devilry in it—I accosted him in Latin, (whilk it is
maist becoming to speak to aught whilk taketh
upon it as a goblin,) and conjured him <i>in nomine</i>,
and so forth, with such words as my poor learning
could furnish of a suddenty, whilk, to say truth, were
not so many, nor altogether so purely latineezed as
might have been, had I not been few years at college,
and many at the pleugh. Well, sirs, he started
at first, as one that heareth that which he expects
not; but presently recovering himself, he wawls on
me with his grey een, like a wild-cat, and opens his
mouth, whilk resembled the mouth of an oven, for
the deil a tongue he had in it, that I could spy, and
took upon his ugly self, altogether the air and bearing
of a bull-dog, whilk I have seen loosed at a fair
upon a mad staig;<a id="FNanchor2_27_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_27_31">[27]</a> whereupon I was something
daunted, and withdrew myself to call upon sister
Baby, who fears neither dog nor devil, when there
is in question the little penny siller. And truly she
raise to the fray as I hae seen the Lindsays and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Ogilvies bristle up, when Donald MacDonnoch, or
the like, made a start down frae the Highlands on
the braes of Islay. But an auld useless carline,
called Tronda Dronsdaughter, (they might call her
Drone the sell of her, without farther addition,)
flung herself right in my sister’s gate, and yelloched
and skirled, that you would have thought her a
whole generation of hounds; whereupon I judged
it best to make ae yoking of it, and stop the pleugh
until I got my sister’s assistance. Whilk when I
had done, and we mounted the stair to the apartment
in which the said dwarf, devil, or other apparition,
was to be seen, dwarf, horn, and siller, were
as clean gane as if the cat had lickit the place where
I saw them.”</p>
<p>Here Triptolemus paused in his extraordinary
narration, while the rest of the party looked upon
each other in surprise, and the Udaller muttered
to Claud Halcro—“By all tokens, this must have
been either the devil or Nicholas Strumpfer; and
if it were him, he is more of a goblin than e’er I
gave him credit for, and shall be apt to rate him
as such in future.” Then, addressing the Factor,
he enquired—“Saw ye nought how this dwarf of
yours parted company?”</p>
<p>“As I shall answer it, no,” replied Triptolemus,
with a cautious look around him, as if daunted
by the recollection; “neither I, nor Baby, who
had her wits more about her, not having seen this
unseemly vision, could perceive any way by whilk
he made evasion. Only Tronda said she saw him
flee forth of the window of the west roundel of the
auld house, upon a dragon, as she averred. But,
as the dragon is held a fabulous animal, I suld pronounce
her averment to rest upon <i>deceptio visus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“But, may we not ask farther,” said Brenda, stimulated
by curiosity to know as much of her cousin
Norna’s family as was possible, “how all this operated
upon Master Yellowley, so as to occasion his
being in this place at so unseasonable an hour?”</p>
<p>“Seasonable it must be, Mistress Brenda, since
it brought us into your sweet company,” answered
Claud Halcro, whose mercurial brain far outstripped
the slow conceptions of the agriculturist, and who
became impatient of being so long silent. “To
say the truth, it was I, Mistress Brenda, who recommended
to our friend the Factor, whose house
I chanced to call at just after this mischance, (and
where, by the way, owing doubtless to the hurry
of their spirits, I was but poorly received,) to make a
visit to our other friend at Fitful-head, well judging
from certain points of the story, at which my other
and more particular friend than either” (looking at
Magnus) “may chance to form a guess, that they
who break a head are the best to find a plaster.
And as our friend the Factor scrupled travelling on
horseback, in respect of some tumbles from our
ponies”——</p>
<p>“Which are incarnate devils,” said Triptolemus,
aloud, muttering under his breath, “like every live
thing that I have found in Zetland.”</p>
<p>“Well, Fowd,” continued Halcro, “I undertook
to carry him to Fitful-head in my little boat, which
Giles and I can manage as if it were an Admiral’s
barge full manned; and Master Triptolemus Yellowley
will tell you how seaman-like I piloted him
to the little haven, within a quarter of a mile of
Norna’s dwelling.”</p>
<p>“I wish to Heaven you had brought me as safe
back again,” said the Factor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why, to be sure,” replied the minstrel, “I am, as
glorious John says,—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘A daring pilot in extremity,<br>
Pleased with the danger when the waves go high,<br>
I seek the storm—but, for a calm unfit,<br>
Will steer too near the sands, to show my wit.’”<br>
</p>
<p>“I showed little wit in intrusting myself to your
charge,” said Triptolemus; “and you still less when
you upset the boat at the throat of the voe, as you
call it, when even the poor bairn, that was mair
than half drowned, told you that you were carrying
too much sail; and then ye wad fasten the rape to
the bit stick on the boat-side, that ye might have
time to play on the fiddle.”</p>
<p>“What!” said the Udaller, “make fast the sheets
to the thwart? a most unseasonable practice, Claud
Halcro.”</p>
<p>“And sae came of it,” replied the agriculturist;
“for the neist blast (and we are never lang without
ane in these parts) whomled us as a gudewife
would whomle a bowie, and ne’er a thing wad Maister
Halcro save but his fiddle. The puir bairn swam
out like a water-spaniel, and I swattered hard for
my life, wi’ the help of ane of the oars; and here
we are, comfortless creatures, that, till a good wind
blew you here, had naething to eat but a mouthful
of Norway rusk, that has mair sawdust than rye-meal
in it, and tastes liker turpentine than any
thing else.”</p>
<p>“I thought we heard you very merry,” said
Brenda, “as we came along the beach.”</p>
<p>“Ye heard a fiddle, Mistress Brenda,” said the
Factor; “and maybe ye may think there can be
nae dearth, miss, where that is skirling. But then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
it was Maister Claud Halcro’s fiddle, whilk, I am
apt to think, wad skirl at his father’s deathbed, or
at his ain, sae lang as his fingers could pinch the
thairm. And it was nae sma’ aggravation to my
misfortune to have him bumming a’ sorts of springs,—Norse
and Scots, Highland and Lawland, English
and Italian, in my lug, as if nothing had happened
that was amiss, and we all in such stress and
perplexity.”</p>
<p>“Why, I told you sorrow would never right the
boat, Factor,” said the thoughtless minstrel, “and
I did my best to make you merry; if I failed, it was
neither my fault nor my fiddle’s. I have drawn the
bow across it before glorious John Dryden himself.”</p>
<p>“I will hear no stories about glorious John Dryden,”
answered the Udaller, who dreaded Halcro’s
narratives as much as Triptolemus did his music,—“I
will hear nought of him, but one story to every
three bowls of punch,—it is our old paction, you
know. But tell me, instead, what said Norna to
you about your errand?”</p>
<p>“Ay, there was anither fine upshot,” said Master
Yellowley. “She wadna look at us, or listen to us;
only she bothered our acquaintance, Master Halcro
here, who thought he could have sae much to say
wi’ her, with about a score of questions about your
family and household estate, Master Magnus Troil;
and when she had gotten a’ she wanted out of him,
I thought she wad hae dung him ower the craig, like
an empty peacod.”</p>
<p>“And for yourself?” said the Udaller.</p>
<p>“She wadna listen to my story, nor hear sae much
as a word that I had to say,” answered Triptolemus;
“and sae much for them that seek to witches and
familiar spirits!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“You needed not to have had recourse to Norna’s
wisdom, Master Factor,” said Minna, not unwilling,
perhaps, to stop his railing against the friend who
had so lately rendered her service; “the youngest
child in Orkney could have told you, that fairy
treasures, if they are not wisely employed for the
good of others, as well as of those to whom they are
imparted, do not dwell long with their possessors.”</p>
<p>“Your humble servant to command, Mistress
Minnie,” said Triptolemus; “I thank ye for the
hint,—and I am blithe that you have gotten your
wits—I beg pardon, I meant your health—into the
barn-yard again. For the treasure, I neither used
nor abused it,—they that live in the house with my
sister Baby wad find it hard to do either!—and as
for speaking of it, whilk they say muckle offends
them whom we in Scotland call Good Neighbours,
and you call Drows, the face of the auld Norse
kings on the coins themselves, might have spoken
as much about it as ever I did.”</p>
<p>“The Factor,” said Claud Halcro, not unwilling to
seize the opportunity of revenging himself on Triptolemus,
for disgracing his seamanship and disparaging
his music,—“The Factor was so scrupulous,
as to keep the thing quiet even from his master, the
Lord Chamberlain; but, now that the matter has
ta’en wind, he is likely to have to account to his
master for that which is no longer in his possession;
for the Lord Chamberlain will be in no hurry, I
think, to believe the story of the dwarf. Neither do
I think” (winking to the Udaller) “that Norna
gave credit to a word of so odd a story; and I dare
say that was the reason that she received us, I must
needs say, in a very dry manner. I rather think she
knew that Triptolemus, our friend here, had found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
some other hiding-hole for the money, and that the
story of the goblin was all his own invention. For
my part, I will never believe there was such a dwarf
to be seen as the creature Master Yellowley describes,
until I set my own eyes on him.”</p>
<p>“Then you may do so at this moment,” said the
Factor; “for, by ——,” (he muttered a deep asseveration
as he sprung on his feet in great horror,)
“there the creature is!”</p>
<p>All turned their eyes in the direction in which
he pointed, and saw the hideous misshapen figure
of Pacolet, with his eyes fixed and glaring at them
through the smoke. He had stolen upon their conversation
unperceived, until the Factor’s eye lighted
upon him in the manner we have described. There
was something so ghastly in his sudden and unexpected
appearance, that even the Udaller, to whom
his form was familiar, could not help starting.
Neither pleased with himself for having testified
this degree of emotion, however slight, nor with the
dwarf who had given cause to it, Magnus asked
him sharply, what was his business there? Pacolet
replied by producing a letter, which he gave
to the Udaller, uttering a sound resembling the
word <i>Shogh</i>.<a id="FNanchor2_28_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_28_32">[28]</a></p>
<p>“That is the Highlandman’s language,” said the
Udaller—“didst thou learn that, Nicholas, when
you lost your own?”</p>
<p>Pacolet nodded, and signed to him to read his
letter.</p>
<p>“That is no such easy matter by fire-light, my
good friend,” replied the Udaller; “but it may concern
Minna, and we must try.”</p>
<p>Brenda offered her assistance, but the Udaller an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>swered,
“No, no, my girl,—Norna’s letters must be
read by those they are written to. Give the knave,
Strumpfer, a drop of brandy the while, though he
little deserves it at my hands, considering the grin
with which he sent the good Nantz down the crag
this morning, as if it had been as much ditch-water.”</p>
<p>“Will you be this honest gentleman’s cup-bearer—his
Ganymede, friend Yellowley, or shall I?”
said Claud Halcro aside to the Factor; while Magnus
Troil, having carefully wiped his spectacles,
which he produced from a large copper case, had
disposed them on his nose, and was studying the
epistle of Norna.</p>
<p>“I would not touch him, or go near him, for all
the Carse of Gowrie,” said the Factor, whose fears
were by no means entirely removed, though he saw
that the dwarf was received as a creature of flesh
and blood by the rest of the company; “but I pray
you to ask him what he has done with my horn
of coins?”</p>
<p>The dwarf, who heard the question, threw back
his head, and displayed his enormous throat, pointing
to it with his finger.</p>
<p>“Nay, if he has swallowed them, there is no
more to be said,” replied the Factor; “only I hope he
will thrive on them as a cow on wet clover. He is
dame Norna’s servant it’s like,—such man, such
mistress! But if theft and witchcraft are to go unpunished
in this land, my lord must find another
factor; for I have been used to live in a country
where men’s worldly gear was keepit from infang
and outfang thief, as well as their immortal souls
from the claws of the deil and his cummers,—sain
and save us!”</p>
<p>The agriculturist was perhaps the less reserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in expressing his complaints, that the Udaller was
for the present out of hearing, having drawn Claud
Halcro apart into another corner of the hut.</p>
<p>“And tell me,” said he, “friend Halcro, what
errand took thee to Sumburgh, since I reckon it
was scarce the mere pleasure of sailing in partnership
with yonder barnacle?”</p>
<p>“In faith, Fowd,” said the bard, “and if you will
have the truth, I went to speak to Norna on your
affairs.”</p>
<p>“On my affairs?” replied the Udaller; “on what
affairs of mine?”</p>
<p>“Just touching your daughter’s health. I heard
that Norna refused your message, and would not see
Eric Scambester. Now, said I to myself, I have
scarce joyed in meat, or drink, or music, or aught
else, since Jarto Minna has been so ill; and I may
say, literally as well as figuratively, that my day
and night have been made sorrowful to me. In
short, I thought I might have some more interest
with old Norna than another, as scalds and wise
women were always accounted something akin; and
I undertook the journey with the hope to be of
some use to my old friend and his lovely daughter.”</p>
<p>“And it was most kindly done of you, good
warm-hearted Claud,” said the Udaller, shaking him
warmly by the hand,—“I ever said you showed
the good old Norse heart amongst all thy fiddling
and thy folly.—Tut, man, never wince for the matter,
but be blithe that thy heart is better than thy
head. Well,—and I warrant you got no answer
from Norna?”</p>
<p>“None to purpose,” replied Claud Halcro; “but
she held me close to question about Minna’s illness,
too,—and I told her how I had met her abroad the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
other morning in no very good weather, and how
her sister Brenda said she had hurt her foot;—in
short, I told her all and every thing I knew.”</p>
<p>“And something more besides, it would seem,”
said the Udaller; “for I, at least, never heard before
that Minna had hurt herself.”</p>
<p>“O, a scratch! a mere scratch!” said the old
man; “but I was startled about it—terrified lest it
had been the bite of a dog, or some hurt from a
venomous thing. I told all to Norna, however.”</p>
<p>“And what,” answered the Udaller, “did she say,
in the way of reply?”</p>
<p>“She bade me begone about my business, and told
me that the issue would be known at the Kirkwall
Fair; and said just the like to this noodle of a Factor—it
was all that either of us got for our labour,”
said Halcro.</p>
<p>“That is strange,” said Magnus. “My kinswoman
writes me in this letter not to fail going
thither with my daughters. This Fair runs strongly
in her head;—one would think she intended to
lead the market, and yet she has nothing to buy or
to sell there that I know of. And so you came away
as wise as you went, and swamped your boat at the
mouth of the voe?”</p>
<p>“Why, how could I help it?” said the poet. “I
had set the boy to steer, and as the flaw came suddenly
off shore, I could not let go the tack and play
on the fiddle at the same time. But it is all well
enough,—salt-water never harmed Zetlander, so as
he could get out of it; and, as Heaven would have
it, we were within man’s depth of the shore, and
chancing to find this skio, we should have done well
enough, with shelter and fire, and are much better
than well with your good cheer and good company.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
But it wears late, and Night and Day must be both
as sleepy as old Midnight can make them. There
is an inner crib here, where the fishers slept,—somewhat
fragrant with the smell of their fish, but
that is wholesome. They shall bestow themselves
there, with the help of what cloaks you have, and
then we will have one cup of brandy, and one stave
of glorious John, or some little trifle of my own,
and so sleep as sound as cobblers.”</p>
<p>“Two glasses of brandy, if you please,” said the
Udaller, “if our stores do not run dry; but not
a single stave of glorious John, or of any one else
to-night.”</p>
<p>And this being arranged and executed agreeably
to the peremptory pleasure of the Udaller, the
whole party consigned themselves to slumber for
the night, and on the next day departed for their
several habitations, Claud Halcro having previously
arranged with the Udaller that he would
accompany him and his daughters on their proposed
visit to Kirkwall.</p>

</p></div>
<p>We must now change the scene from Zetland
to Orkney, and request our readers to accompany
us to the ruins of an elegant, though ancient structure,
called the Earl’s Palace. These remains,
though much dilapidated, still exist in the neighbourhood
of the massive and venerable pile, which
Norwegian devotion dedicated to Saint Magnus
the Martyr, and, being contiguous to the Bishop’s
Palace, which is also ruinous, the place is impressive,
as exhibiting vestiges of the mutations both
in Church and State which have affected Orkney,
as well as countries more exposed to such convulsions.
Several parts of these ruinous buildings
might be selected (under suitable modifications) as
the model of a Gothic mansion, provided architects
would be contented rather to imitate what is really
beautiful in that species of building, than to make
a medley of the caprices of the order, confounding
the military, ecclesiastical, and domestic styles of
all ages at random, with additional fantasies and
combinations of their own device, “all formed out
of the builder’s brain.”</p>
<p>The Earl’s Palace forms three sides of an oblong
square, and has, even in its ruins, the air of an ele<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>gant
yet massive structure, uniting, as was usual in
the residence of feudal princes, the character of a
palace and of a castle. A great banqueting-hall,
communicating with several large rounds, or projecting
turret-rooms, and having at either end an
immense chimney, testifies the ancient Northern
hospitality of the Earls of Orkney, and communicates,
almost in the modern fashion, with a gallery,
or withdrawing-room, of corresponding dimensions,
and having, like the hall, its projecting turrets. The
lordly hall itself is lighted by a fine Gothic window
of shafted stone at one end, and is entered by a spacious
and elegant staircase, consisting of three flights
of stone steps. The exterior ornaments and proportions
of the ancient building are also very handsome;
but, being totally unprotected, this remnant
of the pomp and grandeur of Earls, who assumed
the license as well as the dignity of petty sovereigns,
is now fast crumbling to decay, and has suffered
considerably since the date of our story.</p>
<p>With folded arms and downcast looks the pirate
Cleveland was pacing slowly the ruined hall which
we have just described; a place of retirement which
he had probably chosen because it was distant from
public resort. His dress was considerably altered
from that which he usually wore in Zetland, and
seemed a sort of uniform, richly laced, and exhibiting
no small quantity of embroidery: a hat with a
plume, and a small sword very handsomely mounted,
then the constant companion of every one who assumed
the rank of a gentleman, showed his pretensions
to that character. But if his exterior was so
far improved, it seemed to be otherwise with his
health and spirits. He was pale, and had lost both
the fire of his eye and the vivacity of his step,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and his whole appearance indicated melancholy
of mind, or suffering of body, or a combination of
both evils.</p>
<p>As Cleveland thus paced these ancient ruins, a
young man, of a light and slender form, whose showy
dress seemed to have been studied with care, yet
exhibited more extravagance than judgment or taste,
whose manner was a janty affectation of the free
and easy rake of the period, and the expression of
whose countenance was lively, with a cast of effrontery,
tripped up the staircase, entered the hall, and
presented himself to Cleveland, who merely nodded
to him, and pulling his hat deeper over his brows,
resumed his solitary and discontented promenade.</p>
<p>The stranger adjusted his own hat, nodded in
return, took snuff, with the air of a <i>petit maitre</i>, from
a richly chased gold box, offered it to Cleveland as
he passed, and being repulsed rather coldly, replaced
the box in his pocket, folded his arms in his turn,
and stood looking with fixed attention on his motions
whose solitude he had interrupted. At length
Cleveland stopped short, as if impatient of being
longer the subject of his observation, and said abruptly,
“Why can I not be left alone for half an
hour, and what the devil is it that you want?”</p>
<p>“I am glad you spoke first,” answered the stranger,
carelessly; “I was determined to know whether
you were Clement Cleveland, or Cleveland’s ghost,
and they say ghosts never take the first word, so
I now set it down for yourself in life and limb;
and here is a fine old hurly-house you have found
out for an owl to hide himself in at mid-day, or a
ghost to revisit the pale glimpses of the moon, as
the divine Shakspeare says.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” answered Cleveland, abruptly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
“your jest is made, and now let us have your
earnest.”</p>
<p>“In earnest, then, Captain Cleveland,” replied his
companion, “I think you know me for your friend.”</p>
<p>“I am content to suppose so,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“It is more than supposition,” replied the young
man; “I have proved it—proved it both here and
elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” answered Cleveland, “I admit
you have been always a friendly fellow—and what
then?”</p>
<p>“Well, well—and what then?” replied the other;
“this is but a brief way of thanking folk. Look you,
Captain, here is Benson, Barlowe, Dick Fletcher,
and a few others of us who wished you well, have
kept your old comrade Captain Goffe in these seas
upon the look-out for you, when he and Hawkins,
and the greater part of the ship’s company, would
fain have been down on the Spanish Main, and
at the old trade.”</p>
<p>“And I wish to God that you had all gone about your
business,” said Cleveland, “and left me to my fate.”</p>
<p>“Which would have been to be informed against
and hanged, Captain, the first time that any of these
Dutch or English rascals, whom you have lightened
of their cargoes, came to set their eyes upon you;
and no place more likely to meet with seafaring
men, than in these Islands. And here, to screen you
from such a risk, we have been wasting our precious
time, till folk are grown very peery; and when we
have no more goods or money to spend amongst
them, the fellows will be for grabbing the ship.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, why do you not sail off without me?”
said Cleveland—“there has been fair partition, and
all have had their share—let all do as they like.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
I have lost my ship, and having been once a Captain,
I will not go to sea under command of Goffe
or any other man. Besides, you know well enough
that both Hawkins and he bear me ill-will for keeping
them from sinking the Spanish brig, with the
poor devils of negroes on board.”</p>
<p>“Why, what the foul fiend is the matter with
thee?” said his companion; “are you Clement Cleveland,
our own old true-hearted Clem of the Cleugh,
and do you talk of being afraid of Hawkins and
Goffe, and a score of such fellows, when you have
myself, and Barlowe, and Dick Fletcher at your
back? When was it we deserted you, either in
council or in fight, that you should be afraid of our
flinching now? And as for serving under Goffe, I
hope it is no new thing for gentlemen of fortune
who are going on the account, to change a Captain
now and then? Let us alone for that,—Captain
you shall be; for death rock me asleep if I serve under
that fellow Goffe, who is as very a bloodhound
as ever sucked bitch!—No, no, I thank you—my
Captain must have a little of the gentleman about
him, howsoever. Besides, you know, it was you who
first dipped my hands in the dirty water, and turned
me from a stroller by land, to a rover by sea.”</p>
<p>“Alas, poor Bunce!” said Cleveland, “you owe
me little thanks for that service.”</p>
<p>“That is as you take it,” replied Bunce; “for my
part, I see no harm in levying contributions on the
public either one way or t’other. But I wish you
would forget that name of Bunce, and call me Altamont,
as I have often desired you to do. I hope
a gentleman of the roving trade has as good a right
to have an alias as a stroller, and I never stepped on
the boards but what I was Altamont at the least.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Well, then, Jack Altamont,” replied Cleveland,
“since Altamont is the word”——</p>
<p>“Yes, but, Captain, <i>Jack</i> is not the word, though
Altamont be so. Jack Altamont?—why, ’tis a
velvet coat with paper lace—Let it be Frederick,
Captain; Frederick Altamont is all of a piece.”</p>
<p>“Frederick be it, then, with all my heart,” said
Cleveland; “and pray tell me, which of your names
will sound best at the head of the Last Speech,
Confession, and Dying Words of John Bunce, <i>alias</i>
Frederick Altamont, who was this morning hanged
at Execution-dock, for the crime of Piracy upon the
High Seas?”</p>
<p>“Faith, I cannot answer that question, without
another can of grog, Captain; so if you will go down
with me to Bet Haldane’s on the quay, I will bestow
some thought on the matter, with the help of a right
pipe of Trinidado. We will have the gallon bowl
filled with the best stuff you ever tasted, and I know
some smart wenches who will help us to drain it.
But you shake your head—you’re not i’ the vein?—Well,
then, I will stay with you; for by this
hand, Clem, you shift me not off. Only I will ferret
you out of this burrow of old stones, and carry you
into sunshine and fair air.—Where shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Where you will,” said Cleveland, “so that you
keep out of the way of our own rascals, and all
others.”</p>
<p>“Why, then,” replied Bunce, “you and I will go
up to the Hill of Whitford, which overlooks the
town, and walk together as gravely and honestly as
a pair of well-employed attorneys.”</p>
<p>As they proceeded to leave the ruinous castle,
Bunce, turning back to look at it, thus addressed
his companion:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>“Hark ye, Captain, dost thou know who last inhabited
this old cockloft?”</p>
<p>“An Earl of the Orkneys, they say,” replied
Cleveland.</p>
<p>“And are you avised what death he died of?”
said Bunce; “for I have heard that it was of a tight
neck-collar—a hempen fever, or the like.”</p>
<p>“The people here do say,” replied Cleveland, “that
his Lordship, some hundred years ago, had the mishap
to become acquainted with the nature of a loop
and a leap in the air.”</p>
<p>“Why, la ye there now!” said Bunce; “there
was some credit in being hanged in those days, and
in such worshipful company. And what might his
lordship have done to deserve such promotion?”</p>
<p>“Plundered the liege subjects, they say,” replied
Cleveland; “slain and wounded them, fired upon
his Majesty’s flag, and so forth.”</p>
<p>“Near akin to a gentleman rover, then,” said
Bunce, making a theatrical bow towards the old
building; “and, therefore, my most potent, grave,
and reverend Signior Earl, I crave leave to call
you my loving cousin, and bid you most heartily
adieu. I leave you in the good company of rats
and mice, and so forth, and I carry with me an
honest gentleman, who, having of late had no more
heart than a mouse, is now desirous to run away
from his profession and friends like a rat, and
would therefore be a most fitting denizen of your
Earlship’s palace.”</p>
<p>“I would advise you not to speak so loud, my
good friend Frederick Altamont, or John Bunce,”
said Cleveland; “when you were on the stage, you
might safely rant as loud as you listed; but, in your
present profession, of which you are so fond, every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
man speaks under correction of the yard-arm, and a
running noose.”</p>
<p>The comrades left the little town of Kirkwall in
silence, and ascended the Hill of Whitford, which
raises its brow of dark heath, uninterrupted by enclosures
or cultivation of any kind, to the northward
of the ancient Burgh of Saint Magnus. The plain
at the foot of the hill was already occupied by numbers
of persons who were engaged in making preparations
for the Fair of Saint Olla, to be held upon the
ensuing day, and which forms a general rendezvous
to all the neighbouring islands of Orkney, and is
even frequented by many persons from the more
distant archipelago of Zetland. It is, in the words
of the Proclamation, “a free Mercat and Fair, holden
at the good Burgh of Kirkwall on the third of August,
being Saint Olla’s day,” and continuing for an indefinite
space thereafter, extending from three days to a
week, and upwards. The fair is of great antiquity,
and derives its name from Olaus, Olave, Ollaw, the
celebrated Monarch of Norway, who, rather by the
edge of his sword than any milder argument, introduced
Christianity into those isles, and was respected
as the patron of Kirkwall some time before
he shared that honour with Saint Magnus the
Martyr.</p>
<p>It was no part of Cleveland’s purpose to mingle
in the busy scene which was here going on; and,
turning their route to the left, they soon ascended
into undisturbed solitude, save where the grouse,
more plentiful in Orkney, perhaps, than in any other
part of the British dominions, rose in covey, and
went off before them.<a id="FNanchor2_29_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_29_33">[29]</a> Having continued to ascend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
till they had wellnigh reached the summit of the
conical hill, both turned round, as with one consent,
to look at and admire the prospect beneath.</p>
<p>The lively bustle which extended between the
foot of the hill and the town, gave life and variety
to that part of the scene; then was seen the town
itself, out of which arose, like a great mass, superior
in proportion as it seemed to the whole burgh, the
ancient Cathedral of Saint Magnus, of the heaviest
order of Gothic architecture, but grand, solemn, and
stately, the work of a distant age, and of a powerful
hand. The quay, with the shipping, lent additional
vivacity to the scene; and not only the whole
beautiful bay, which lies betwixt the promontories
of Inganess and Quanterness, at the bottom of which
Kirkwall is situated, but all the sea, so far as visible,
and in particular the whole strait betwixt the
island of Shapinsha and that called Pomona, or the
Mainland, was covered and enlivened by a variety
of boats and small vessels, freighted from distant
islands to convey passengers or merchandise to the
Fair of Saint Olla.</p>
<p>Having attained the point by which this fair and
busy prospect was most completely commanded,
each of the strangers, in seaman fashion, had recourse
to his spy-glass, to assist the naked eye in
considering the bay of Kirkwall, and the numerous
vessels by which it was traversed. But the attention
of the two companions seemed to be arrested
by different objects. That of Bunce, or Altamont,
as he chose to call himself, was riveted to the armed
sloop, where, conspicuous by her square rigging
and length of beam, with the English jack and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
pennon, which they had the precaution to keep flying,
she lay among the merchant vessels, as distinguished
from them by the trim neatness of her appearance,
as a trained soldier amongst a crowd of
clowns.</p>
<p>“Yonder she lies,” said Bunce; “I wish to God
she was in the bay of Honduras—you Captain, on
the quarter-deck, I your lieutenant, and Fletcher
quarter-master, and fifty stout fellows under us—I
should not wish to see these blasted heaths and
rocks again for a while!—And Captain you shall
soon be. The old brute Goffe gets drunk as a lord
every day, swaggers, and shoots, and cuts, among
the crew; and, besides, he has quarrelled with the
people here so damnably, that they will scarce let
water or provisions go on board of us, and we expect
an open breach every day.”</p>
<p>As Bunce received no answer, he turned short
round on his companion, and, perceiving his attention
otherwise engaged, exclaimed,—“What the
devil is the matter with you? or what can you see
in all that trumpery small-craft, which is only loaded
with stock-fish, and ling, and smoked geese, and
tubs of butter that is worse than tallow?—the cargoes
of the whole lumped together would not be
worth the flash of a pistol.—No, no, give me such
a chase as we might see from the mast-head off the
island of Trinidado. Your Don, rolling as deep
in the water as a grampus, deep-loaden with rum,
sugar, and bales of tobacco, and all the rest ingots,
moidores, and gold dust; then set all sail, clear the
deck, stand to quarters, up with the Jolly Roger<a id="FNanchor2_30_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_30_34">[30]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>—we
near her—we make her out to be well
manned and armed”——</p>
<p>“Twenty guns on her lower deck,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Forty, if you will,” retorted Bunce, “and we
have but ten mounted—never mind. The Don
blazes away—never mind yet, my brave lads—run
her alongside, and on board with you—to work,
with your grenadoes, your cutlasses, pole-axes, and
pistols—The Don cries Misericordia, and we share
the cargo without <i>co licencio, Seignior</i>!”</p>
<p>“By my faith,” said Cleveland, “thou takest so
kindly to the trade, that all the world may see that
no honest man was spoiled when you were made a
pirate. But you shall not prevail on me to go farther
in the devil’s road with you; for you know
yourself that what is got over his back is spent—you
wot how. In a week, or a month at most, the
rum and the sugar are out, the bales of tobacco
have become smoke, the moidores, ingots, and gold
dust, have got out of our hands, into those of the
quiet, honest, conscientious folks, who dwell at Port
Royal and elsewhere—wink hard on our trade as
long as we have money, but not a jot beyond. Then
we have cold looks, and it may be a hint is given to
the Judge Marshal; for, when our pockets are worth
nothing, our honest friends, rather than want, will
make money upon our heads. Then comes a high
gallows and a short halter, and so dies the Gentleman
Rover. I tell thee, I will leave this trade;
and, when I turn my glass from one of these barks
and boats to another, there is not the worst of them
which I would not row for life, rather than continue
to be what I have been. These poor men make
the sea a means of honest livelihood and friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
communication between shore and shore, for the
mutual benefit of the inhabitants; but we have
made it a road to the ruin of others, and to our own
destruction here and in eternity.—I am determined
to turn honest man, and use this life no longer!”</p>
<p>“And where will your honesty take up its abode,
if it please you?” said Bunce.—“You have broken
the laws of every nation, and the hand of the law
will detect and crush you wherever you may take
refuge.—Cleveland, I speak to you more seriously
than I am wont to do. I have had my reflections,
too; and they have been bad enough, though they
lasted but a few minutes, to spoil me weeks of
joviality. But here is the matter,—what can we
do but go on as we have done, unless we have a
direct purpose of adorning the yard-arm?”</p>
<p>“We may claim the benefit of the proclamation
to those of our sort who come in and surrender,”
said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Umph!” answered his companion, dryly; “the
date of that day of grace has been for some time
over, and they may take the penalty or grant the
pardon at their pleasure. Were I you, I would not
put my neck in such a venture.”</p>
<p>“Why, others have been admitted but lately to
favour, and why should not I?” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Ay,” replied his associate, “Harry Glasby and
some others have been spared; but Glasby did what
was called good service, in betraying his comrades,
and retaking the Jolly Fortune; and that I think
you would scorn, even to be revenged of the brute
Goffe yonder.”</p>
<p>“I would die a thousand times sooner,” said
Cleveland.</p>
<p>“I will be sworn for it,” said Bunce; “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the others were forecastle fellows—petty larceny
rogues, scarce worth the hemp it would have cost
to hang them. But your name has stood too high
amongst the gentlemen of fortune for you to get off
so easily. You are the prime buck of the herd,
and will be marked accordingly.”</p>
<p>“And why so, I pray you?” said Cleveland;
“you know well enough my aim, Jack.”</p>
<p>“Frederick, if you please,” said Bunce.</p>
<p>“The devil take your folly!—Prithee keep thy
wit, and let us be grave for a moment.”</p>
<p>“For a moment—be it so,” said Bunce; “but I
feel the spirit of Altamont coming fast upon me,—I
have been a grave man for ten minutes already.”</p>
<p>“Be so then for a little longer,” said Cleveland;
“I know, Jack, that you really love me; and, since
we have come thus far in this talk, I will trust you
entirely. Now tell me, why should I be refused the
benefit of this gracious proclamation? I have borne
a rough outside, as thou knowest; but, in time of
need, I can show the numbers of lives which I have
been the means of saving, the property which I have
restored to those who owned it, when, without my
intercession, it would have been wantonly destroyed.
In short, Bunce, I can show”——</p>
<p>“That you were as gentle a thief as Robin Hood
himself,” said Bunce; “and, for that reason, I,
Fletcher, and the better sort among us, love you,
as one who saves the character of us Gentlemen
Rovers from utter reprobation.—Well, suppose
your pardon made out, what are you to do next?—what
class in society will receive you?—with whom
will you associate? Old Drake, in Queen Bess’s
time, could plunder Peru and Mexico without a line
of commission to show for it, and, blessed be her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
memory! he was knighted for it on his return. And
there was Hal Morgan, the Welshman, nearer our
time, in the days of merry King Charles, brought
all his gettings home, had his estate and his country-house,
and who but he? But that is all ended now—once
a pirate, and an outcast for ever. The poor
devil may go and live, shunned and despised by
every one, in some obscure seaport, with such part
of his guilty earnings as courtiers and clerks leave
him—for pardons do not pass the seals for nothing;—and,
when he takes his walk along the pier, if a
stranger asks, who is the down-looking, swarthy,
melancholy man, for whom all make way, as if he
brought the plague in his person, the answer shall
be, that is such a one, the pardoned pirate!—No
honest man will speak to him, no woman of repute
will give him her hand.”</p>
<p>“Your picture is too highly coloured, Jack,” said
Cleveland, suddenly interrupting his friend; “there
are women—there is one at least, that would be
true to her lover, even if he were what you have
described.”</p>
<p>Bunce was silent for a space, and looked fixedly
at his friend. “By my soul!” he said, at length, “I
begin to think myself a conjurer. Unlikely as it all
was, I could not help suspecting from the beginning
that there was a girl in the case. Why, this is
worse than Prince Volscius in love, ha! ha! ha!”</p>
<p>“Laugh as you will,” said Cleveland, “it is true;—there
is a maiden who is contented to love me,
pirate as I am; and I will fairly own to you, Jack,
that, though I have often at times detested our
roving life, and myself for following it, yet I doubt
if I could have found resolution to make the break
which I have now resolved on, but for her sake.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Why, then, God-a-mercy!” replied Bunce,
“there is no speaking sense to a madman; and love
in one of our trade, Captain, is little better than
lunacy. The girl must be a rare creature, for a wise
man to risk hanging for her. But, harkye, may she
not be a little touched, as well as yourself?—and
is it not sympathy that has done it? She cannot be
one of our ordinary cockatrices, but a girl of conduct
and character.”</p>
<p>“Both are as undoubted as that she is the most
beautiful and bewitching creature whom the eye
ever opened upon,” answered Cleveland.</p>
<p>“And she loves thee, knowing thee, most noble
Captain, to be a commander among those gentlemen
of fortune, whom the vulgar call pirates?”</p>
<p>“Even so—I am assured of it,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Why, then,” answered Bunce, “she is either
mad in good earnest, as I said before, or she does
not know what a pirate is.”</p>
<p>“You are right in the last point,” replied Cleveland.
“She has been bred in such remote simplicity,
and utter ignorance of what is evil, that she
compares our occupation with that of the old Norsemen,
who swept sea and haven with their victorious
galleys, established colonies, conquered countries,
and took the name of Sea-Kings.”</p>
<p>“And a better one it is than that of pirate, and
comes much to the same purpose, I dare say,” said
Bunce. “But this must be a mettled wench!—why
did you not bring her aboard? methinks it
was pity to baulk her fancy.”</p>
<p>“And do you think,” said Cleveland, “that I
could so utterly play the part of a fallen spirit as
to avail myself of her enthusiastic error, and bring
an angel of beauty and innocence acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
such a hell as exists on board of yonder infernal
ship of ours?—I tell you, my friend, that, were all
my former sins doubled in weight and in dye, such
a villainy would have outglared and outweighed
them all.”</p>
<p>“Why, then, Captain Cleveland,” said his confident,
“methinks it was but a fool’s part to come
hither at all. The news must one day have gone
abroad, that the celebrated pirate Captain Cleveland,
with his good sloop the Revenge, had been lost on
the Mainland of Zetland, and all hands perished;
so you would have remained hid both from friend
and enemy, and might have married your pretty
Zetlander, and converted your sash and scarf into
fishing-nets, and your cutlass into a harpoon, and
swept the seas for fish instead of florins.”</p>
<p>“And so I had determined,” said the Captain;
“but a Jagger, as they call them here, like a meddling,
peddling thief as he is, brought down intelligence
to Zetland of your lying here, and I was fain
to set off, to see if you were the consort of whom I
had told them, long before I thought of leaving the
roving trade.”</p>
<p>“Ay,” said Bunce, “and so far you judged well.
For, as you had heard of our being at Kirkwall, so
we should have soon learned that you were at Zetland;
and some of us for friendship, some for hatred,
and some for fear of your playing Harry Glasby
upon us, would have come down for the purpose of
getting you into our company again.”</p>
<p>“I suspected as much,” said the Captain, “and
therefore was fain to decline the courteous offer of
a friend, who proposed to bring me here about this
time. Besides, Jack, I recollected, that, as you say,
my pardon will not pass the seals without money,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
my own was waxing low—no wonder, thou knowest
I was never a churl of it—And so”——</p>
<p>“And so you came for your share of the cobs?”
replied his friend—“It was wisely done; and we
shared honourably—so far Goffe has acted up to
articles, it must be allowed. But keep your purpose
of leaving him close in your breast, for I dread his
playing you some dog’s trick or other; for he certainly
thought himself sure of your share, and will
hardly forgive your coming alive to disappoint
him.”</p>
<p>“I fear him not,” said Cleveland, “and he knows
that well. I would I were as well clear of the consequences
of having been his comrade, as I hold
myself to be of all those which may attend his ill-will.
Another unhappy job I may be troubled with—I
hurt a young fellow, who has been my plague
for some time, in an unhappy brawl that chanced
the morning I left Zetland.”</p>
<p>“Is he dead?” asked Bunce: “It is a more serious
question here, than it would be on the Grand
Caimains or the Bahama Isles, where a brace or two
of fellows may be shot in a morning, and no more
heard of, or asked about them, than if they were so
many wood-pigeons. But here it may be otherwise;
so I hope you have not made your friend immortal.”</p>
<p>“I hope not,” said the Captain, “though my
anger has been fatal to those who have given me
less provocation. To say the truth, I was sorry
for the lad notwithstanding, and especially as I was
forced to leave him in mad keeping.”</p>
<p>“In mad keeping?” said Bunce; “why, what
means that?”</p>
<p>“You shall hear,” replied his friend. “In the
first place, you are to know, this young man came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
suddenly on me while I was trying to gain Minna’s
ear for a private interview before I set sail, that I
might explain my purpose to her. Now, to be
broken in on by the accursed rudeness of this
young fellow at such a moment”——</p>
<p>“The interruption deserved death,” said Bunce,
“by all the laws of love and honour!”</p>
<p>“A truce with your ends of plays, Jack, and
listen one moment.—The brisk youth thought
proper to retort, when I commanded him to be
gone. I am not, thou knowest, very patient, and
enforced my commands with a blow, which he returned
as roundly. We struggled, till I became
desirous that we should part at any rate, which I
could only effect by a stroke of my poniard, which,
according to old use, I have, thou knowest, always
about me. I had scarce done this when I repented;
but there was no time to think of any thing save
escape and concealment, for, if the house rose on
me, I was lost; as the fiery old man, who is head of
the family, would have done justice on me had I
been his brother. I took the body hastily on my
shoulders to carry it down to the sea-shore, with
the purpose of throwing it into a <i>riva</i>, as they call
them, or chasm of great depth, where it would have
been long enough in being discovered. This done,
I intended to jump into the boat which I had lying
ready, and set sail for Kirkwall. But, as I was
walking hastily towards the beach with my burden,
the poor young fellow groaned, and so apprized me
that the wound had not been instantly fatal. I
was by this time well concealed amongst the rocks,
and, far from desiring to complete my crime, I laid
the young man on the ground, and was doing what
I could to stanch the blood, when suddenly an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
woman stood before me. She was a person whom I
had frequently seen while in Zetland, and to whom
they ascribe the character of a sorceress, or, as the
negroes say, an Obi woman. She demanded the
wounded man of me, and I was too much pressed
for time to hesitate in complying with her request.
More she was about to say to me, when we heard
the voice of a silly old man, belonging to the family,
singing at some distance. She then pressed her
finger on her lip as a sign of secrecy, whistled very
low, and a shapeless, deformed brute of a dwarf coming
to her assistance, they carried the wounded man
into one of the caverns with which the place abounds,
and I got to my boat and to sea with all expedition.
If that old hag be, as they say, connected with the
King of the Air, she favoured me that morning
with a turn of her calling; for not even the West
Indian tornadoes, which we have weathered together,
made a wilder racket than the squall that drove me
so far out of our course, that, without a pocket-compass,
which I chanced to have about me, I
should never have recovered the Fair Isle, for which
we run, and where I found a brig which brought me
to this place. But, whether the old woman meant
me weal or woe, here we came at length in safety
from the sea, and here I remain in doubts and
difficulties of more kinds than one.”</p>
<p>“O, the devil take the Sumburgh-head,” said
Bunce, “or whatever they call the rock that you
knocked our clever little Revenge against!”</p>
<p>“Do not say <i>I</i> knocked her on the rock,” said
Cleveland; “have I not told you fifty times, if the
cowards had not taken to their boat, though I
showed them the danger, and told them they would
all be swamped, which happened the instant they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
cast off the painter, she would have been afloat at
this moment? Had they stood by me and the ship,
their lives would have been saved; had I gone with
them, mine would have been lost; who can say
which is for the best?”</p>
<p>“Well,” replied his friend, “I know your case
now, and can the better help and advise. I will be
true to you, Clement, as the blade to the hilt; but
I cannot think that you should leave us. As the
old Scottish song says, ‘Wae’s my heart that we
should sunder!’—But come, you will aboard with
us to-day, at any rate?”</p>
<p>“I have no other place of refuge,” said Cleveland,
with a sigh.</p>
<p>He then once more ran his eyes over the bay,
directing his spy-glass upon several of the vessels
which traversed its surface, in hopes, doubtless, of
discerning the vessel of Magnus Troil, and then
followed his companion down the hill in silence.</p>

</p>
<p>Cleveland, with his friend Bunce, descended the
hill for a time in silence, until at length the latter
renewed their conversation.</p>
<p>“You have taken this fellow’s wound more on
your conscience than you need, Captain—I have
known you do more, and think less on’t.”</p>
<p>“Not on such slight provocation, Jack,” replied
Cleveland. “Besides, the lad saved my life; and,
say that I requited him the favour, still we should
not have met on such evil terms; but I trust that
he may receive aid from that woman, who has certainly
strange skill in simples.”</p>
<p>“And over simpletons, Captain,” said his friend,
“in which class I must e’en put you down, if you
think more on this subject. That you should be
made a fool of by a young woman, why it is many
an honest man’s case;—but to puzzle your pate
about the mummeries of an old one, is far too great
a folly to indulge a friend in. Talk to me of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Minna, since you so call her, as much as you will;
but you have no title to trouble your faithful squire-errant
with your old mumping magician. And now
here we are once more amongst the booths and tents,
which these good folk are pitching—let us look, and
see whether we may not find some fun and frolic
amongst them. In merry England, now, you would
have seen, on such an occasion, two or three bands
of strollers, as many fire-eaters and conjurers, as
many shows of wild beasts; but, amongst these
grave folk, there is nothing but what savours of
business and of commodity—no, not so much as a
single squall from my merry gossip Punch and his
rib Joan.”</p>
<p>As Bunce thus spoke, Cleveland cast his eyes on
some very gay clothes, which, with other articles,
hung out upon one of the booths, that had a good
deal more of ornament and exterior decoration than
the rest. There was in front a small sign of canvass
painted, announcing the variety of goods which
the owner of the booth, Bryce Snailsfoot, had on
sale, and the reasonable prices at which he proposed
to offer them to the public. For the further
gratification of the spectator, the sign bore on the
opposite side an emblematic device, resembling our
first parents in their vegetable garments, with
this legend—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Poor sinners whom the snake deceives,<br>
Are fain to cover them with leaves.<br>
Zetland hath no leaves, ’tis true,<br>
Because that trees are none, or few;<br>
But we have flax and taits of woo’,<br>
For linen cloth and wadmaal blue;<br>
And we have many of foreign knacks<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>Of finer waft, than woo’ or flax.<br>
Ye gallanty Lambmas lads,<a id="FNanchor2_31_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_31_35">[31]</a> appear,<br>
And bring your Lambmas sisters here;<br>
Bryce Snailsfoot spares not cost or care,<br>
To pleasure every gentle pair.”<br>
</p>
<p>While Cleveland was perusing these goodly
rhymes, which brought to his mind Claud Halcro,
to whom, as the poet laureate of the island, ready
with his talent alike in the service of the great and
small, they probably owed their origin, the worthy
proprietor of the booth, having cast his eye upon
him, began with hasty and trembling hand to remove
some of the garments, which, as the sale did
not commence till the ensuing day, he had exposed
either for the purpose of airing them, or to excite
the admiration of the spectators.</p>
<p>“By my word, Captain,” whispered Bunce to
Cleveland, “you must have had that fellow under
your clutches one day, and he remembers one gripe
of your talons, and fears another. See how fast he
is packing his wares out of sight, so soon as he set
eyes on you!”</p>
<p>“<i>His</i> wares!” said Cleveland, on looking more
attentively at his proceedings; “By Heaven, they
are my clothes which I left in a chest at Jarlshof
when the Revenge was lost there—Why, Bryce
Snailsfoot, thou thief, dog, and villain, what means
this? Have you not made enough of us by cheap
buying and dear selling, that you have seized on
my trunk and wearing apparel?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Bryce Snailsfoot, who probably would otherwise
not have been willing to <i>see</i> his friend the Captain,
was now by the vivacity of his attack obliged to pay
attention to him. He first whispered to his little
foot-page, by whom, as we have already noticed, he
was usually attended, “Run to the town-council-house,
jarto, and tell the provost and bailies they
maun send some of their officers speedily, for here
is like to be wild wark in the fair.”</p>
<p>So having said, and having seconded his commands
by a push on the shoulder of his messenger,
which sent him spinning out of the shop as fast as
heels could carry him, Bryce Snailsfoot turned to
his old acquaintance, and, with that amplification
of words and exaggeration of manner, which in Scotland
is called “making a phrase,” he ejaculated—“The
Lord be gude to us! the worthy Captain
Cleveland, that we were all sae grieved about, returned
to relieve our hearts again! Wat have my
cheeks been for you,” (here Bryce wiped his eyes,)
“and blithe am I now to see you restored to your
sorrowing friends!”</p>
<p>“My sorrowing friends, you rascal!” said Cleveland;
“I will give you better cause for sorrow than
ever you had on my account, if you do not tell me
instantly where you stole all my clothes.”</p>
<p>“Stole!” ejaculated Bryce, casting up his eyes;
“now the Powers be gude to us!—the poor gentleman
has lost his reason in that weary gale of wind.”</p>
<p>“Why, you insolent rascal!” said Cleveland,
grasping the cane which he carried, “do you think
to bamboozle me with your impudence? As you
would have a whole head on your shoulders, and
your bones in a whole skin, one minute longer, tell
me where the devil you stole my wearing apparel?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>”</p>
<p>Bryce Snailsfoot ejaculated once more a repetition
of the word “Stole! Now Heaven be gude to us!”
but at the same time, conscious that the Captain was
likely to be sudden in execution, cast an anxious
look to the town, to see the loitering aid of the civil
power advance to his rescue.</p>
<p>“I insist on an instant answer,” said the Captain,
with upraised weapon, “or else I will beat you to
a mummy, and throw out all your frippery upon the
common!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Master John Bunce, who considered
the whole affair as an excellent good jest, and not
the worse one that it made Cleveland very angry,
seized hold of the Captain’s arm, and, without any
idea of ultimately preventing him from executing
his threats, interfered just so much as was necessary
to protract a discussion so amusing.</p>
<p>“Nay, let the honest man speak,” he said, “messmate;
he has as fine a cozening face as ever stood
on a knavish pair of shoulders, and his are the true
flourishes of eloquence, in the course of which men
snip the cloth an inch too short. Now, I wish you
to consider that you are both of a trade,—he measures
bales by the yard, and you by the sword,—and
so I will not have him chopped up till he has
had a fair chase.”</p>
<p>“You are a fool!” said Cleveland, endeavouring to
shake his friend off.—“Let me go! for, by Heaven,
I will be foul of him!”</p>
<p>“Hold him fast,” said the pedlar, “good dear
merry gentleman, hold him fast!”</p>
<p>“Then say something for yourself,” said Bunce;
“use your gob-box, man; patter away, or, by my
soul, I will let him loose on you!”</p>
<p>“He says I stole these goods,” said Bryce, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
now saw himself run so close, that pleading to the
charge became inevitable. “Now, how could I
steal them, when they are mine by fair and lawful
purchase?”</p>
<p>“Purchase! you beggarly vagrant!” said Cleveland;
“from whom did you dare to buy my clothes?
or who had the impudence to sell them?”</p>
<p>“Just that worthy professor Mrs. Swertha, the
housekeeper at Jarlshof, who acted as your executor,”
said the pedlar; “and a grieved heart she had.”</p>
<p>“And so she was resolved to make a heavy pocket
of it, I suppose,” said the Captain; “but how did
she dare to sell the things left in her charge?”</p>
<p>“Why, she acted all for the best, good woman!”
said the pedlar, anxious to protract the discussion
until the arrival of succours; “and, if you will but
hear reason, I am ready to account with you for the
chest and all that it holds.”</p>
<p>“Speak out, then, and let us have none of thy
damnable evasions,” said Captain Cleveland; “if
you show ever so little purpose of being somewhat
honest for once in thy life, I will not beat thee.”</p>
<p>“Why, you see, noble Captain,” said the pedlar,—and
then muttered to himself, “plague on Pate
Paterson’s cripple knee, they will be waiting for
him, hirpling useless body!” then resumed aloud—“The
country, you see, is in great perplexity,—great
perplexity, indeed,—much perplexity, truly.
There was your honour missing, that was loved
by great and small—clean missing—nowhere to
be heard of—a lost man—umquhile—dead—defunct!”</p>
<p>“You shall find me alive to your cost, you scoundrel!”
said the irritated Captain.</p>
<p>“Weel, but take patience,—ye will not hear a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
body speak,” said the Jagger.—“Then there was
the lad Mordaunt Mertoun”——</p>
<p>“Ha!” said the Captain, “what of him?”</p>
<p>“Cannot be heard of,” said the pedlar; “clean and
clear tint,—a gone youth;—fallen, it is thought,
from the craig into the sea—he was aye venturous.
I have had dealings with him for furs and feathers,
whilk he swapped against powder and shot, and the
like; and now he has worn out from among us—clean
retired—utterly vanished, like the last puff
of an auld wife’s tobacco pipe.”</p>
<p>“But what is all this to the Captain’s clothes, my
dear friend?” said Bunce; “I must presently beat
you myself unless you come to the point.”</p>
<p>“Weel, weel,—patience, patience,” said Bryce,
waving his hand; “you will get all time enough.
Weel, there are two folks gane, as I said, forbye the
distress at Burgh-Westra about Mistress Minna’s
sad ailment”——</p>
<p>“Bring not <i>her</i> into your buffoonery, sirrah,” said
Cleveland, in a tone of anger, not so loud, but far
deeper and more concentrated than he had hitherto
used; “for, if you name her with less than reverence,
I will crop the ears out of your head, and make you
swallow them on the spot!”</p>
<p>“He, he, he!” faintly laughed the Jagger; “that
were a pleasant jest! you are pleased to be witty.
But, to say naething of Burgh-Westra, there is the
carle at Jarlshof, he that was the auld Mertoun,
Mordaunt’s father, whom men thought as fast bound
to the place he dwelt in as the Sumburgh-head
itsell, naething maun serve him but he is lost as
weel as the lave about whom I have spoken. And
there’s Magnus Troil (wi’ favour be he named) taking
horse; and there is pleasant Maister Claud Halcro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
taking boat, whilk he steers worst of any man in
Zetland, his head running on rambling rhymes;
and the Factor body is on the stir—the Scots Factor,—him
that is aye speaking of dikes and delving,
and such unprofitable wark, which has naething of
merchandise in it, and he is on the lang trot, too;
so that ye might say, upon a manner, the tae half
of the Mainland of Zetland is lost, and the other is
running to and fro seeking it—awfu’ times!”</p>
<p>Captain Cleveland had subdued his passion, and
listened to this tirade of the worthy man of merchandise,
with impatience indeed, yet not without the
hope of hearing something that might concern him.
But his companion was now become impatient in his
turn:—“The clothes!” he exclaimed, “the clothes,
the clothes, the clothes!” accompanying each repetition
of the words with a flourish of his cane, the
dexterity of which consisted in coming mighty near
the Jagger’s ears without actually touching them.</p>
<p>The Jagger, shrinking from each of these demonstrations,
continued to exclaim, “Nay, sir—good
sir—worthy sir—for the clothes—I found the
worthy dame in great distress on account of her old
maister, and on account of her young maister, and
on account of worthy Captain Cleveland; and because
of the distress of the worthy Fowd’s family,
and the trouble of the great Fowd himself,—and
because of the Factor, and in respect of Claud Halcro,
and on other accounts and respects. Also we
mingled our sorrows and our tears with a bottle, as
the holy text hath it, and called in the Ranzelman
to our council, a worthy man, Niel Ronaldson by
name, who hath a good reputation.”</p>
<p>Here another flourish of the cane came so very
near that it partly touched his ear. The Jagger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
started back, and the truth, or that which he desired
should be considered as such, bolted from him
without more circumlocution; as a cork, after much
unnecessary buzzing and fizzing, springs forth from
a bottle of spruce beer.</p>
<p>“In brief, what the deil mair would you have
of it?—the woman sold me the kist of clothes—they
are mine by purchase, and that is what I will
live and die upon.”</p>
<p>“In other words,” said Cleveland, “this greedy
old hag had the impudence to sell what was none
of hers; and you, honest Bryce Snailsfoot, had the
assurance to be the purchaser?”</p>
<p>“Ou dear, Captain,” said the conscientious pedlar,
“what wad ye hae had twa poor folk to do?
There was yoursell gane that aught the things, and
Maister Mordaunt was gane that had them in keeping,
and the things were but damply put up, where
they were rotting with moth and mould, and”——</p>
<p>“And so this old thief sold them, and you bought
them, I suppose, just to keep them from spoiling?”
said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Weel then,” said the merchant, “I’m thinking,
noble Captain, that wad be just the gate of it.”</p>
<p>“Well then, hark ye, you impudent scoundrel,” said
the Captain. “I do not wish to dirty my fingers with
you, or to make any disturbance in this place”——</p>
<p>“Good reason for that, Captain—aha!” said the
Jagger, slyly.</p>
<p>“I will break your bones if you speak another
word,” replied Cleveland. “Take notice—I offer
you fair terms—give me back the black leathern
pocket-book with the lock upon it, and the purse
with the doubloons, with some few of the clothes
I want, and keep the rest in the devil’s name!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Doubloons!!!”—exclaimed the Jagger, with
an exaltation of voice intended to indicate the
utmost extremity of surprise,—“What do I ken of
doubloons? my dealing was for doublets, and not
for doubloons—If there were doubloons in the kist,
doubtless Swertha will have them in safe keeping
for your honour—the damp wouldna harm the gold,
ye ken.”</p>
<p>“Give me back my pocket-book and my goods,
you rascally thief,” said Cleveland, “or without a
word more I will beat your brains out!”</p>
<p>The wily Jagger, casting eye around him, saw
that succour was near, in the shape of a party of
officers, six in number; for several rencontres with
the crew of the pirate had taught the magistrates
of Kirkwall to strengthen their police parties when
these strangers were in question.</p>
<p>“Ye had better keep the <i>thief</i> to suit yoursell,
honoured Captain,” said the Jagger, emboldened by
the approach of the civil power; “for wha kens
how a’ these fine goods and bonny-dies were come
by?”</p>
<p>This was uttered with such provoking slyness of
look and tone, that Cleveland made no further delay,
but, seizing upon the Jagger by the collar,
dragged him over his temporary counter, which was,
with all the goods displayed thereon, overset in the
scuffle; and, holding him with one hand, inflicted
on him with the other a severe beating with his
cane. All this was done so suddenly and with such
energy, that Bryce Snailsfoot, though rather a stout
man, was totally surprised by the vivacity of the
attack, and made scarce any other effort at extricating
himself than by roaring for assistance like a
bull-calf. The “loitering aid” having at length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
come up, the officers made an effort to seize on
Cleveland, and by their united exertions succeeded
in compelling him to quit hold of the pedlar, in
order to defend himself from their assault. This he
did with infinite strength, resolution, and dexterity,
being at the same time well seconded by his friend
Jack Bunce, who had seen with glee the drubbing
sustained by the pedlar, and now combated tightly
to save his companion from the consequences. But,
as there had been for some time a growing feud between
the townspeople and the crew of the Rover,
the former, provoked by the insolent deportment
of the seamen, had resolved to stand by each other,
and to aid the civil power upon such occasions of
riot as should occur in future; and so many assistants
came up to the rescue of the constables, that
Cleveland, after fighting most manfully, was at
length brought to the ground and made prisoner.
His more fortunate companion had escaped by
speed of foot, as soon as he saw that the day must
needs be determined against them.</p>
<p>The proud heart of Cleveland, which, even in its
perversion, had in its feelings something of original
nobleness, was like to burst, when he felt himself
borne down in this unworthy brawl—dragged into
the town as a prisoner, and hurried through the
streets towards the Council-house, where the magistrates
of the burgh were then seated in council.
The probability of imprisonment, with all its consequences,
rushed also upon his mind, and he
cursed an hundred times the folly which had not
rather submitted to the pedlar’s knavery, than involved
him in so perilous an embarrassment.</p>
<p>But just as they approached the door of the
Council-house, which is situated in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the little town, the face of matters was suddenly
changed by a new and unexpected incident.</p>
<p>Bunce, who had designed, by his precipitate retreat,
to serve as well his friend as himself, had hied
him to the haven, where the boat of the Rover was
then lying, and called the cockswain and boat’s crew
to the assistance of Cleveland. They now appeared
on the scene—fierce desperadoes, as became their
calling, with features bronzed by the tropical sun
under which they had pursued it. They rushed at
once amongst the crowd, laying about them with
their stretchers; and, forcing their way up to Cleveland,
speedily delivered him from the hands of the
officers, who were totally unprepared to resist an
attack so furious and so sudden, and carried him
off in triumph towards the quay,—two or three of
their number facing about from time to time to keep
back the crowd, whose efforts to recover the prisoner
were the less violent, that most of the seamen were
armed with pistols and cutlasses, as well as with
the less lethal weapons which alone they had as yet
made use of.</p>
<p>They gained their boat in safety, and jumped into
it, carrying along with them Cleveland, to whom
circumstances seemed to offer no other refuge, and
pushed off for their vessel, singing in chorus to their
oars an old ditty, of which the natives of Kirkwall
could only hear the first stanza:</p>
<p class="poem">
“Robin Rover<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said to his crew,</span><br>
‘Up with the black flag,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down with the blue!—</span><br>
Fire on the main-top,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fire on the bow,</span><br>
Fire on the gun-deck,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fire down below!’”</span><br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<p>The wild chorus of their voices was heard long
after the words ceased to be intelligible.—And thus
was the pirate Cleveland again thrown almost
involuntarily amongst those desperate associates,
from whom he had so often resolved to detach
himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote2_31_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_31_35" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It was anciently a custom at Saint Olla’s Fair at Kirkwall,
that the young people of the lower class, and of either sex, associated
in pairs for the period of the Fair, during which the couple
were termed Lambmas brother and sister. It is easy to conceive
that the exclusive familiarity arising out of this custom was liable
to abuse, the rather that it is said little scandal was attached to
the indiscretions which it occasioned.</p></div>

</p>
<p>Our wandering narrative must now return to Mordaunt
Mertoun.—We left him in the perilous condition
of one who has received a severe wound, and
we now find him in the condition of a convalescent—pale,
indeed, and feeble from the loss of
much blood, and the effects of a fever which had
followed the injury, but so far fortunate, that the
weapon, having glanced on the ribs, had only occasioned
a great effusion of blood, without touching
any vital part, and was now wellnigh healed; so
efficacious were the vulnerary plants and salves
with which it had been treated by the sage Norna
of Fitful-head.</p>
<p>The matron and her patient now sat together in
a dwelling in a remote island. He had been transported,
during his illness, and ere he had perfect
consciousness, first to her singular habitation near
Fitful-head, and thence to her present abode, by
one of the fishing-boats on the station of Burgh-Westra.
For such was the command possessed by
Norna over the superstitious character of her countrymen,
that she never failed to find faithful agents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to execute her commands, whatever these happened
to be; and, as her orders were generally given
under injunctions of the strictest secrecy, men reciprocally
wondered at occurrences, which had in
fact been produced by their own agency, and that
of their neighbours, and in which, had they communicated
freely with each other, no shadow of the
marvellous would have remained.</p>
<p>Mordaunt was now seated by the fire, in an apartment
indifferently well furnished, having a book in
his hand, which he looked upon from time to time
with signs of ennui and impatience; feelings which
at length so far overcame him, that, flinging the
volume on the table, he fixed his eyes on the fire,
and assumed the attitude of one who is engaged in
unpleasant meditation.</p>
<p>Norna, who sat opposite to him, and appeared
busy in the composition of some drug or unguent,
anxiously left her seat, and, approaching Mordaunt,
felt his pulse, making at the same time the most
affectionate enquiries whether he felt any sudden
pain, and where it was seated. The manner in
which Mordaunt replied to these earnest enquiries,
although worded so as to express gratitude for her
kindness, while he disclaimed any feeling of indisposition,
did not seem to give satisfaction to the
Pythoness.</p>
<p>“Ungrateful boy!” she said, “for whom I have
done so much; you whom I have rescued, by my
power and skill, from the very gates of death,—are
you already so weary of me, that you cannot refrain
from showing how desirous you are to spend, at a
distance from me, the very first intelligent days of
the life which I have restored you?”</p>
<p>“You do me injustice, my kind preserver,” re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>plied
Mordaunt; “I am not tired of your society;
but I have duties which recall me to ordinary life.”</p>
<p>“Duties!” repeated Norna; “and what duties can
or ought to interfere with the gratitude which you
owe to me?—Duties! Your thoughts are on the use
of your gun, or on clambering among the rocks in
quest of sea-fowl. For these exercises your strength
doth not yet fit you; and yet these are the duties
to which you are so anxious to return!”</p>
<p>“Not so, my good and kind mistress,” said Mordaunt.—“To
name one duty, out of many, which
makes me seek to leave you, now that my strength
permits, let me mention that of a son to his father.”</p>
<p>“To your father!” said Norna, with a laugh that
had something in it almost frantic. “O! you know
not how we can, in these islands, at once cancel such
duties! And, for your father,” she added, proceeding
more calmly, “what has he done for you, to
deserve the regard and duty you speak of?—Is he
not the same, who, as you have long since told me,
left you for so many years poorly nourished among
strangers, without enquiring whether you were alive
or dead, and only sending, from time to time, supplies
in such fashion, as men relieve the leprous
wretch to whom they fling alms from a distance?
And, in these later years, when he had made you
the companion of his misery, he has been, by starts
your pedagogue, by starts your tormentor, but
never, Mordaunt, never your father.”</p>
<p>“Something of truth there is in what you say,”
replied Mordaunt: “My father is not fond; but he
is, and has ever been, effectively kind. Men have
not their affections in their power; and it is a
child’s duty to be grateful for the benefits which he
receives, even when coldly bestowed. My father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
has conferred instruction on me, and I am convinced
he loves me. He is unfortunate; and, even
if he loved me not”——</p>
<p>“And he does <i>not</i> love you,” said Norna, hastily;
“he never loved any thing, or any one, save himself.
He is unfortunate, but well are his misfortunes
deserved.—O Mordaunt, you have one
parent only,—one parent, who loves you as the
drops of the heart-blood!”</p>
<p>“I know I have but one parent,” replied Mordaunt;
“my mother has been long dead.—But
your words contradict each other.”</p>
<p>“They do not—they do not,” said Norna, in a
paroxysm of the deepest feeling; “you have but
one parent. Your unhappy mother is not dead—I
would to God that she were!—but she is not dead.
Thy mother is the only parent that loves thee; and
I—I, Mordaunt,” throwing herself on his neck, “am
that most unhappy—yet most happy mother.”</p>
<p>She closed him in a strict and convulsive embrace;
and tears, the first, perhaps, which she had
shed for many years, burst in torrents as she sobbed
on his neck. Astonished at what he heard, felt,
and saw,—moved by the excess of her agitation, yet
disposed to ascribe this burst of passion to insanity,—Mordaunt
vainly endeavoured to tranquillize the
mind of this extraordinary person.</p>
<p>“Ungrateful boy!” she said, “who but a mother
would have watched over thee as I have watched?
From the instant I saw thy father, when he little
thought by whom he was observed, a space now
many years back, I knew him well; and, under his
charge, I saw you, then a stripling,—while Nature,
speaking loud in my bosom, assured me, thou wert
blood of my blood, and bone of my bone. Think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
how often you have wondered to see me, when
least expected, in your places of pastime and resort!
Think how often my eye has watched you on the
giddy precipices, and muttered those charms which
subdue the evil demons, who show themselves to
the climber on the giddiest point of his path, and
force him to quit his hold! Did I not hang around
thy neck, in pledge of thy safety, that chain of gold,
which an Elfin King gave to the founder of our
race? Would I have given that dear gift to any
but to the son of my bosom?—Mordaunt, my
power has done that for thee that a mere mortal
mother would dread to think of. I have conjured
the Mermaid at midnight, that thy bark might be
prosperous on the Haaf! I have hushed the winds,
and navies have flapped their empty sails against
the mast in inactivity, that you might safely indulge
your sport upon the crags!”</p>
<p>Mordaunt, perceiving that she was growing yet
wilder in her talk, endeavoured to frame an answer
which should be at once indulgent, soothing,
and calculated to allay the rising warmth of her
imagination.</p>
<p>“Dear Norna,” he said, “I have indeed many
reasons to call you mother, who have bestowed so
many benefits upon me; and from me you shall
ever receive the affection and duty of a child. But
the chain you mentioned, it has vanished from my
neck—I have not seen it since the ruffian stabbed
me.”</p>
<p>“Alas! and can you think of it at this moment?”
said Norna, in a sorrowful accent.—“But be it so;—and
know, it was I took it from thy neck, and
tied it around the neck of her who is dearest to
you; in token that the union betwixt you, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
has been the only earthly wish which I have had
the power to form, shall yet, even yet, be accomplished—ay,
although hell should open to forbid
the bans!”</p>
<p>“Alas!” said Mordaunt, with a sigh, “you remember
not the difference betwixt our situation—her
father is wealthy, and of ancient birth.”</p>
<p>“Not more wealthy than will be the heir of Norna
of Fitful-head,” answered the Pythoness—“not of
better or more ancient blood than that which flows
in thy veins, derived from thy mother, the descendant
of the same Jarls and Sea-Kings from whom
Magnus boasts his origin.—Or dost thou think, like
the pedant and fanatic strangers who have come
amongst us, that thy blood is dishonoured because
my union with thy father did not receive the sanction
of a priest?—Know, that we were wedded after
the ancient manner of the Norse—our hands were
clasped within the circle of Odin,<a id="FNanchor2_32_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_32_36">[32]</a> with such deep
vows of eternal fidelity, as even the laws of these
usurping Scots would have sanctioned as equivalent
to a blessing before the altar. To the offspring of
such a union, Magnus has nought to object. It
was weak—it was criminal, on my part, but it conveyed
no infamy to the birth of my son.”</p>
<p>The composed and collected manner in which
Norna argued these points began to impose upon
Mordaunt an incipient belief in the truth of what
she said; and, indeed, she added so many circumstances,
satisfactorily and rationally connected with
each other, as seemed to confute the notion that her
story was altogether the delusion of that insanity
which sometimes showed itself in her speech and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
actions. A thousand confused ideas rushed upon
him, when he supposed it possible that the unhappy
person before him might actually have a right to
claim from him the respect and affection due to a
parent from a son. He could only surmount them
by turning his mind to a different, and scarce less
interesting topic, resolving within himself to take
time for farther enquiry and mature consideration,
ere he either rejected or admitted the claim which
Norna preferred upon his affection and duty. His
benefactress, at least, she undoubtedly was, and he
could not err in paying her, as such, the respect
and attention due from a son to a mother; and
so far, therefore, he might gratify Norna without
otherwise standing committed.</p>
<p>“And do you then really think, my mother,—since
so you bid me term you,”—said Mordaunt,
“that the proud Magnus Troil may, by any inducement,
be prevailed upon to relinquish the angry
feelings which he has of late adopted towards
me, and to permit my addresses to his daughter
Brenda?”</p>
<p>“Brenda?” repeated Norna—“who talks of
Brenda?—it was of Minna that I spoke to you.”</p>
<p>“But it was of Brenda that I thought,” replied
Mordaunt, “of her that I now think, and of her
alone that I will ever think.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, my son!” replied Norna. “You
cannot be so dull of heart, so poor of spirit, as
to prefer the idle mirth and housewife simplicity
of the younger sister, to the deep feeling and high
mind of the noble-spirited Minna? Who would
stoop to gather the lowly violet, that might have
the rose for stretching out his hand?”</p>
<p>“Some think the lowliest flowers are the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>est,”
replied Mordaunt, “and in that faith will I
live and die.”</p>
<p>“You dare not tell me so!” answered Norna,
fiercely; then, instantly changing her tone, and
taking his hand in the most affectionate manner,
she proceeded:—“You must not—you will not tell
me so, my dear son—you will not break a mother’s
heart in the very first hour in which she has embraced
her child!—Nay, do not answer, but hear
me. You must wed Minna—I have bound around
her neck a fatal amulet, on which the happiness of
both depends. The labours of my life have for years
had this direction. Thus it must be, and not otherwise—Minna
must be the bride of my son!”</p>
<p>“But is not Brenda equally near, equally dear to
you?” replied Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“As near in blood,” said Norna, “but not so
dear, no not half so dear, in affection. Minna’s mild,
yet high and contemplative spirit, renders her a
companion meet for one, whose ways, like mine, are
beyond the ordinary paths of this world. Brenda
is a thing of common and ordinary life, an idle
laugher and scoffer, who would level art with ignorance,
and reduce power to weakness, by disbelieving
and turning into ridicule whatever is beyond
the grasp of her own shallow intellect.”</p>
<p>“She is, indeed,” answered Mordaunt, “neither
superstitious nor enthusiastic, and I love her the
better for it. Remember also, my mother, that she
returns my affection, and that Minna, if she loves
any one, loves the stranger Cleveland.”</p>
<p>“She does not—she dares not,” answered Norna,
“nor dares he pursue her farther. I told him,
when first he came to Burgh-Westra, that I destined
her for you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“And to that rash annunciation,” said Mordaunt,
“I owe this man’s persevering enmity—my wound,
and wellnigh the loss of my life. See, my mother,
to what point your intrigues have already conducted
us, and, in Heaven’s name, prosecute them
no farther!”</p>
<p>It seemed as if this reproach struck Norna with
the force, at once, and vivacity of lightning; for
she struck her forehead with her hand, and seemed
about to drop from her seat. Mordaunt, greatly
shocked, hastened to catch her in his arms, and,
though scarce knowing what to say, attempted to
utter some incoherent expressions.</p>
<p>“Spare me, Heaven, spare me!” were the first
words which she muttered; “do not let my crime
be avenged by his means!—Yes, young man,” she
said, after a pause, “you have dared to tell what
I dared not tell myself. You have pressed that
upon me, which, if it be truth, I cannot believe, and
yet continue to live!”</p>
<p>Mordaunt in vain endeavoured to interrupt her
with protestations of his ignorance how he had
offended or grieved her, and of his extreme regret
that he had unintentionally done either. She
proceeded, while her voice trembled wildly, with
vehemence.</p>
<p>“Yes! you have touched on that dark suspicion
which poisons the consciousness of my power,—the
sole boon which was given me in exchange for innocence
and for peace of mind! Your voice joins
that of the demon which, even while the elements
confess me their mistress, whispers to me, ‘Norna,
this is but delusion—your power rests but in the
idle belief of the ignorant, supported by a thousand
petty artifices of your own.’—This is what Brenda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
says—this is what you would say; and false, scandalously
false, as it is, there are rebellious thoughts
in this wild brain of mine,” (touching her forehead
with her finger as she spoke,) “that, like an insurrection
in an invaded country, arise to take part
against their distressed sovereign.—Spare me, my
son!” she continued in a voice of supplication,
“spare me!—the sovereignty of which your words
would deprive me, is no enviable exaltation. Few
would covet to rule over gibbering ghosts, and
howling winds, and raging currents. My throne
is a cloud, my sceptre a meteor, my realm is only
peopled with fantasies; but I must either cease to
be, or continue to be the mightiest as well as the
most miserable of beings!”<a id="FNanchor2_33_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_33_37">[33]</a></p>
<p>“Do not speak thus mournfully, my dear and unhappy
benefactress,” said Mordaunt, much affected;
“I will think of your power whatever you would
have me believe. But, for your own sake, view
the matter otherwise. Turn your thoughts from
such agitating and mystical studies—from such
wild subjects of contemplation, into another and a
better channel. Life will again have charms, and
religion will have comforts, for you.”</p>
<p>She listened to him with some composure, as if
she weighed his counsel, and desired to be guided
by it; but, as he ended, she shook her head and
exclaimed—</p>
<p>“It cannot be. I must remain the dreaded—the
mystical—the Reimkennar—the controller of
the elements, or I must be no more! I have no alternative,
no middle station. My post must be high
on yon lofty headland, where never stood human
foot save mine—or I must sleep at the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the unfathomable ocean, its white billows booming
over my senseless corpse. The parricide shall never
also be denounced as the impostor!”</p>
<p>“The parricide!” echoed Mordaunt, stepping
back in horror.</p>
<p>“Yes, my son!” answered Norna, with a stern
composure, even more frightful than her former
impetuosity, “within these fatal walls my father
met his death by my means. In yonder chamber
was he found a livid and lifeless corpse. Beware
of filial disobedience, for such are its fruits!”</p>
<p>So saying, she arose and left the apartment, where
Mordaunt remained alone to meditate at leisure
upon the extraordinary communication which he
had received. He himself had been taught by his
father a disbelief in the ordinary superstitions of
Zetland; and he now saw that Norna, however
ingenious in duping others, could not altogether
impose on herself. This was a strong circumstance
in favour of her sanity of intellect; but, on the other
hand, her imputing to herself the guilt of parricide
seemed so wild and improbable, as, in Mordaunt’s
opinion, to throw much doubt upon her other
assertions.</p>
<p>He had leisure enough to make up his mind on
these particulars, for no one approached the solitary
dwelling, of which Norna, her dwarf, and he
himself, were the sole inhabitants. The Hoy island
in which it stood is rude, bold, and lofty, consisting
entirely of three hills—or rather one huge mountain
divided into three summits, with the chasms,
rents, and valleys, which descend from its summit
to the sea, while its crest, rising to great height,
and shivered into rocks which seem almost inaccessible,
intercepts the mists as they drive from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Atlantic, and, often obscured from the human eye,
forms the dark and unmolested retreat of hawks,
eagles, and other birds of prey.<a id="FNanchor2_34_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_34_38">[34]</a></p>
<p>The soil of the island is wet, mossy, cold, and unproductive,
presenting a sterile and desolate appearance,
excepting where the sides of small rivulets,
or mountain ravines, are fringed with dwarf bushes
of birch, hazel, and wild currant, some of them so
tall as to be denominated trees, in that bleak and
bare country.</p>
<p>But the view of the sea-beach, which was Mordaunt’s
favourite walk, when his convalescent state
began to permit him to take exercise, had charms
which compensated the wild appearance of the
interior. A broad and beautiful sound, or strait,
divides this lonely and mountainous island from
Pomona, and in the centre of that sound lies, like
a tablet composed of emerald, the beautiful and
verdant little island of Græmsay. On the distant
Mainland is seen the town or village of Stromness,
the excellence of whose haven is generally evinced
by a considerable number of shipping in the roadstead,
and, from the bay growing narrower, and
lessening as it recedes, runs inland into Pomona,
where its tide fills the fine sheet of water called the
Loch of Stennis.</p>
<p>On this beach Mordaunt was wont to wander for
hours, with an eye not insensible to the beauties of
the view, though his thoughts were agitated with
the most embarrassing meditations on his own situation.
He was resolved to leave the island as soon
as the establishment of his health should permit him
to travel; yet gratitude to Norna, of whom he was
at least the adopted, if not the real son, would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
allow him to depart without her permission, even if
he could obtain means of conveyance, of which he
saw little possibility. It was only by importunity
that he extorted from his hostess a promise, that, if
he would consent to regulate his motions according
to her directions, she would herself convey him to
the capital of the Orkney Islands, when the approaching
Fair of Saint Olla should take place there.</p>

</p>
<p>When Cleveland, borne off in triumph from his
assailants in Kirkwall, found himself once more on
board the pirate-vessel, his arrival was hailed with
hearty cheers by a considerable part of the crew,
who rushed to shake hands with him, and offer their
congratulations on his return; for the situation of a
Buccanier Captain raised him very little above the
level of the lowest of his crew, who, in all social intercourse,
claimed the privilege of being his equal.</p>
<p>When his faction, for so these clamorous friends
might be termed, had expressed their own greetings,
they hurried Cleveland forward to the stern,
where Goffe, their present commander, was seated
on a gun, listening in a sullen and discontented
mood to the shout which announced Cleveland’s
welcome. He was a man betwixt forty and fifty,
rather under the middle size, but so very strongly
made, that his crew used to compare him to a sixty-four
cut down. Black-haired, bull-necked, and
beetle-browed, his clumsy strength and ferocious
countenance contrasted strongly with the manly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
figure and open countenance of Cleveland, in which
even the practice of his atrocious profession had not
been able to eradicate a natural grace of motion
and generosity of expression. The two piratical
Captains looked upon each other for some time in
silence, while the partisans of each gathered around
him. The elder part of the crew were the principal
adherents of Goffe, while the young fellows, among
whom Jack Bunce was a principal leader and
agitator, were in general attached to Cleveland.</p>
<p>At length Goffe broke silence.—“You are welcome
aboard, Captain Cleveland.—Smash my taffrail!
I suppose you think yourself commodore
yet! but that was over, by G—, when you lost your
ship, and be d—d!”</p>
<p>And here, once for all, we may take notice, that
it was the gracious custom of this commander to
mix his words and oaths in nearly equal proportions,
which he was wont to call <i>shotting</i> his discourse.
As we delight not, however, in the discharge of such
artillery, we shall only indicate by a space like this
---- the places in which these expletives occurred;
and thus, if the reader will pardon a very poor pun,
we will reduce Captain Goffe’s volley of sharp-shot
into an explosion of blank cartridges. To his insinuations
that he was come on board to assume the
chief command, Cleveland replied, that he neither
desired, nor would accept, any such promotion, but
would only ask Captain Goffe for a cast of the boat,
to put him ashore in one of the other islands, as he
had no wish either to command Goffe, or to remain
in a vessel under his orders.</p>
<p>“And why not under my orders, brother?”
demanded Goffe, very austerely; “— — — are
you too good a man, — — — with your cheese-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>toaster
and your jib there, — — to serve under
my orders, and be d—d to you, where there are
so many gentlemen that are elder and better
seamen than yourself?”</p>
<p>“I wonder which of these capital seamen it was,”
said Cleveland, coolly, “that laid the ship under the
fire of yon six-gun battery, that could blow her out
of the water, if they had a mind, before you could
either cut or slip? Elder and better sailors than I
may like to serve under such a lubber, but I beg
to be excused for my own share, Captain—that’s
all I have got to tell you.”</p>
<p>“By G—, I think you are both mad!” said
Hawkins the boatswain—“a meeting with sword
and pistol may be devilish good fun in its way,
when no better is to be had; but who the devil that
had common sense, amongst a set of gentlemen in
our condition, would fall a quarrelling with each
other, to let these duck-winged, web-footed islanders
have a chance of knocking us all upon the head?”</p>
<p>“Well said, old Hawkins!” observed Derrick the
quarter-master, who was an officer of very considerable
importance among these rovers; “I say,
if the two captains won’t agree to live together
quietly, and club both heart and head to defend
the vessel, why, d—n me, depose them both, say
I, and choose another in their stead!”</p>
<p>“Meaning yourself, I suppose, Master Quarter-Master!”
said Jack Bunce; “but that cock won’t
fight. He that is to command gentlemen, should
be a gentleman himself, I think; and I give my
vote for Captain Cleveland, as spirited and as
gentleman-like a man as ever daffed the world
aside, and bid it pass!”</p>
<p>“What! <i>you</i> call yourself a gentleman, I war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>rant!”
retorted Derrick; “why, —— your eyes!
a tailor would make a better out of the worst suit
of rags in your strolling wardrobe!—It is a shame
for men of spirit to have such a Jack-a-dandy scarecrow
on board!”</p>
<p>Jack Bunce was so incensed at these base comparisons,
that without more ado, he laid his hand
on his sword. The carpenter, however, and boatswain,
interfered, the former brandishing his broad
axe, and swearing he would put the skull of the
first who should strike a blow past clouting, and the
latter reminding them, that, by their articles, all
quarrelling, striking, or more especially fighting,
on board, was strictly prohibited; and that, if any
gentleman had a quarrel to settle, they were to
go ashore, and decide it with cutlass and pistol in
presence of two of their messmates.</p>
<p>“I have no quarrel with any one, — — —!”
said Goffe, sullenly; “Captain Cleveland has wandered
about among the islands here, amusing himself, — — —!
and we have wasted our time and
property in waiting for him, when we might have
been adding twenty or thirty thousand dollars to
the stock-purse. However, if it pleases the rest
of the gentlemen-adventurers, — — —! why, I
shall not grumble about it.”</p>
<p>“I propose,” said the boatswain, “that there
should be a general council called in the great
cabin, according to our articles, that we may consider
what course we are to hold in this matter.”</p>
<p>A general assent followed the boatswain’s proposal;
for every one found his own account in these
general councils, in which each of the rovers had a
free vote. By far the greater part of the crew only
valued this franchise, as it allowed them, upon such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
solemn occasions, an unlimited quantity of liquor—a
right which they failed not to exercise to the uttermost,
by way of aiding their deliberations. But
a few amongst the adventurers, who united some
degree of judgment with the daring and profligate
character of their profession, were wont, at such
periods, to limit themselves within the bounds of
comparative sobriety, and by these, under the apparent
form of a vote of the general council, all
things of moment relating to the voyage and undertakings
of the pirates were in fact determined.
The rest of the crew, when they recovered from
their intoxication, were easily persuaded that the
resolution adopted had been the legitimate effort
of the combined wisdom of the whole senate.</p>
<p>Upon the present occasion the debauch had proceeded
until the greater part of the crew were, as
usual, displaying inebriation in all its most brutal
and disgraceful shapes—swearing empty and unmeaning
oaths—venting the most horrid imprecations
in the mere gaiety of their heart—singing
songs, the ribaldry of which was only equalled by
their profaneness; and, from the middle of this
earthly hell, the two captains, together with one or
two of their principal adherents, as also the carpenter
and boatswain, who always took a lead on
such occasions, had drawn together into a pandemonium,
or privy council of their own, to consider
what was to be done; for, as the boatswain metaphorically
observed, they were in a narrow channel,
and behoved to keep sounding the tide-way.</p>
<p>When they began their consultations, the friends
of Goffe remarked, to their great displeasure, that
he had not observed the wholesome rule to which
we have just alluded; but that, in endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
drown his mortification at the sudden appearance
of Cleveland, and the reception he met with from
the crew, the elder Captain had not been able to do
so without overflowing his reason at the same time.
His natural sullen taciturnity had prevented this
from being observed until the council began its
deliberations, when it proved impossible to hide it.</p>
<p>The first person who spoke was Cleveland, who
said, that, so far from wishing the command of the
vessel, he desired no favour at any one’s hand,
except to land him upon some island or holm at a
distance from Kirkwall, and leave him to shift for
himself.</p>
<p>The boatswain remonstrated strongly against this
resolution. “The lads,” he said, “all knew Cleveland,
and could trust his seamanship, as well as his
courage; besides, he never let the grog get quite
uppermost, and was always in proper trim, either
to sail the ship, or to fight the ship, whereby she
was never without some one to keep her course when
he was on board.—And as for the noble Captain
Goffe,” continued the mediator, “he is as stout a
heart as ever broke biscuit, and that I will uphold
him; but then, when he has his grog aboard—I
speak to his face—he is so d—d funny with his
cranks and his jests, that there is no living with
him. You all remember how nigh he had run the
ship on that cursed Horse of Copinsha, as they call
it, just by way of frolic; and then you know how
he fired off his pistol under the table, when we
were at the great council, and shot Jack Jenkins
in the knee, and cost the poor devil his leg, with
his pleasantry.”<a id="FNanchor2_35_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_35_39">[35]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>“Jack Jenkins was not a chip the worse,” said
the carpenter; “I took the leg off with my saw as
well as any loblolly-boy in the land could have done—heated
my broad axe, and seared the stump—ay,
by ——! and made a jury-leg that he shambles
about with as well as ever he did—for Jack could
never cut a feather.”<a id="FNanchor2_36_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_36_40">[36]</a></p>
<p>“You are a clever fellow, carpenter,” replied the
boatswain, “a d—d clever fellow! but I had rather
you tried your saw and red-hot axe upon the ship’s
knee-timbers than on mine, sink me!—But that
here is not the case—The question is, if we shall
part with Captain Cleveland here, who is a man of
thought and action, whereby it is my belief it would
be heaving the pilot overboard when the gale is
blowing on a lee-shore. And, I must say, it is not
the part of a true heart to leave his mates, who
have been here waiting for him till they have
missed stays. Our water is wellnigh out, and we
have junketed till provisions are low with us. We
cannot sail without provisions—we cannot get provisions
without the good-will of the Kirkwall folks.
If we remain here longer, the Halcyon frigate will
be down upon us—she was seen off Peterhead two
days since,—and we shall hang up at the yard-arm
to be sun-dried. Now, Captain Cleveland will get
us out of the hobble, if any can. He can play the
gentleman with these Kirkwall folks, and knows
how to deal with them on fair terms, and foul, too,
if there be occasion for it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>”</p>

<p>“And so you would turn honest Captain Goffe
a-grazing, would ye?” said an old weatherbeaten
pirate, who had but one eye; “what though he has
his humours, and made my eye dowse the glim in
his fancies and frolics, he is as honest a man as
ever walked a quarter-deck, for all that; and d—n
me but I stand by him so long as t’other lantern is
lit!”</p>
<p>“Why, you would not hear me out,” said Hawkins;
“a man might as well talk to so many negers!—I
tell you, I propose that Cleveland shall only be
Captain from one, <i>post meridiem</i>, to five <i>a. m.</i>, during
which time Goffe is always drunk.”</p>
<p>The Captain of whom he last spoke gave sufficient
proof of the truth of his words, by uttering an inarticulate
growl, and attempting to present a pistol at
the mediator Hawkins.</p>
<p>“Why, look ye now!” said Derrick, “there is all
the sense he has, to get drunk on council-day, like
one of these poor silly fellows!”</p>
<p>“Ay,” said Bunce, “drunk as Davy’s sow, in the
face of the field, the fray, and the senate!”</p>
<p>“But, nevertheless,” continued Derrick, “it will
never do to have two captains in the same day. I
think week about might suit better—and let Cleveland
take the first turn.”</p>
<p>“There are as good here as any of them,” said
Hawkins; “howsomdever, I object nothing to Captain
Cleveland, and I think he may help us into
deep water as well as another.”</p>
<p>“Ay,” exclaimed Bunce, “and a better figure he
will make at bringing these Kirkwallers to order
than his sober predecessor!—So Captain Cleveland
for ever!”</p>
<p>“Stop, gentlemen,” said Cleveland, who had
hith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>erto been silent; “I hope you will not choose me
Captain without my own consent?”</p>
<p>“Ay, by the blue vault of heaven will we,” said
Bunce, “if it be <i>pro bono publico</i>!”</p>
<p>“But hear me, at least,” said Cleveland—“I do
consent to take command of the vessel, since you
wish it, and because I see you will ill get out of the
scrape without me.”</p>
<p>“Why, then, I say, Cleveland for ever, again!”
shouted Bunce.</p>
<p>“Be quiet, prithee, dear Bunce!—honest Altamont!”
said Cleveland.—“I undertake the business
on this condition; that, when I have got the
ship cleared for her voyage, with provisions, and so
forth, you will be content to restore Captain Goffe
to the command, as I said before, and put me ashore
somewhere, to shift for myself—You will then be
sure it is impossible I can betray you, since I will
remain with you to the last moment.”</p>
<p>“Ay, and after the last moment, too, by the blue
vault! or I mistake the matter,” muttered Bunce to
himself.</p>
<p>The matter was now put to the vote; and so confident
were the crew in Cleveland’s superior address
and management, that the temporary deposition of
Goffe found little resistance even among his own
partisans, who reasonably enough observed, “he
might at least have kept sober to look after his
own business—E’en let him put it to rights again
himself next morning, if he will.”</p>
<p>But when the next morning came, the drunken
part of the crew, being informed of the issue of the
deliberations of the council, to which they were virtually
held to have assented, showed such a superior
sense of Cleveland’s merits, that Goffe, sulky and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
malecontent as he was, judged it wisest for the
present to suppress his feelings of resentment, until
a safer opportunity for suffering them to explode,
and to submit to the degradation which so frequently
took place among a piratical crew.</p>
<p>Cleveland, on his part, resolved to take upon him,
with spirit and without loss of time, the task of extricating
his ship’s company from their perilous situation.
For this purpose, he ordered the boat, with
the purpose of going ashore in person, carrying with
him twelve of the stoutest and best men of the
crew, all very handsomely appointed, (for the success
of their nefarious profession had enabled the
pirates to assume nearly as gay dresses as their
officers,) and above all, each man being sufficiently
armed with cutlass and pistols, and several having
pole-axes and poniards.</p>
<p>Cleveland himself was gallantly attired in a blue
coat, lined with crimson silk, and laced with gold
very richly, crimson damask waistcoat and breeches,
a velvet cap, richly embroidered, with a white feather,
white silk stockings, and red-heeled shoes, which
were the extremity of finery among the gallants of
the day. He had a gold chain several times folded
round his neck, which sustained a whistle of the
same metal, the ensign of his authority. Above
all, he wore a decoration peculiar to those daring
depredators, who, besides one, or perhaps two brace
of pistols at their belt, had usually two additional
brace, of the finest mounting and workmanship, suspended
over their shoulders in a sort of sling or
scarf of crimson ribbon. The hilt and mounting of
the Captain’s sword corresponded in value to the rest
of his appointments, and his natural good mien was
so well adapted to the whole equipment, that, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
he appeared on deck, he was received with a general
shout by the crew, who, as in other popular societies,
judged a great deal by the eye.</p>
<p>Cleveland took with him in the boat, amongst
others, his predecessor in office, Goffe, who was also
very richly dressed, but who, not having the advantage
of such an exterior as Cleveland’s, looked like
a boorish clown in the dress of a courtier, or rather
like a vulgar-faced footpad decked in the spoils of
some one whom he has murdered, and whose claim
to the property of his garments is rendered doubtful
in the eyes of all who look upon him, by the mixture
of awkwardness, remorse, cruelty, and insolence,
which clouds his countenance. Cleveland probably
chose to take Goffe ashore with him, to prevent his
having any opportunity, during his absence, to debauch
the crew from their allegiance. In this guise
they left the ship, and, singing to their oars, while
the water foamed higher at the chorus, soon reached
the quay of Kirkwall.</p>
<p>The command of the vessel was in the meantime
intrusted to Bunce, upon whose allegiance Cleveland
knew that he might perfectly depend, and, in
a private conversation with him of some length, he
gave him directions how to act in such emergencies
as might occur.</p>
<p>These arrangements being made, and Bunce having
been repeatedly charged to stand upon his guard
alike against the adherents of Goffe and any attempt
from the shore, the boat put off. As she approached
the harbour, Cleveland displayed a white flag, and
could observe that their appearance seemed to occasion
a good deal of bustle and alarm. People were
seen running to and fro, and some of them appeared
to be getting under arms. The battery was manned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
hastily, and the English colours displayed. These
were alarming symptoms, the rather that Cleveland
knew, that, though there were no artillerymen in
Kirkwall, yet there were many sailors perfectly competent
to the management of great guns, and willing
enough to undertake such service in case of need.</p>
<p>Noting these hostile preparations with a heedful
eye, but suffering nothing like doubt or anxiety to
appear on his countenance, Cleveland ran the boat
right for the quay, on which several people, armed
with muskets, rifles, and fowlingpieces, and others
with half-pikes and whaling-knives, were now assembled,
as if to oppose his landing. Apparently,
however, they had not positively determined what
measures they were to pursue; for, when the boat
reached the quay, those immediately opposite bore
back, and suffered Cleveland and his party to leap
ashore without hinderance. They immediately drew
up on the quay, except two, who, as their Captain
had commanded, remained in the boat, which they
put off to a little distance; a manœuvre which,
while it placed the boat (the only one belonging to
the sloop) out of danger of being seized, indicated
a sort of careless confidence in Cleveland and his
party, which was calculated to intimidate their
opponents.</p>
<p>The Kirkwallers, however, showed the old Northern
blood, put a manly face upon the matter, and
stood upon the quay, with their arms shouldered,
directly opposite to the rovers, and blocking up
against them the street which leads to the town.</p>
<p>Cleveland was the first who spoke, as the parties
stood thus looking upon each other.—“How is this,
gentlemen burghers?” he said; “are you Orkney
folks turned Highlandmen, that you are all under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
arms so early this morning; or have you manned
the quay to give me the honour of a salute, upon
taking the command of my ship?”</p>
<p>The burghers looked on each other, and one of
them replied to Cleveland—“We do not know who
you are; it was that other man,” pointing to Goffe,
“who used to come ashore as Captain.”</p>
<p>“That other gentleman is my mate, and commands
in my absence,” said Cleveland;—“but what
is that to the purpose? I wish to speak with your
Lord Mayor, or whatever you call him.”</p>
<p>“The Provost is sitting in council with the Magistrates,”
answered the spokesman.</p>
<p>“So much the better,” replied Cleveland.—“Where
do their Worships meet?”</p>
<p>“In the Council-house,” answered the other.</p>
<p>“Then make way for us, gentlemen, if you please,
for my people and I are going there.”</p>
<p>There was a whisper among the townspeople; but
several were unresolved upon engaging in a desperate,
and perhaps an unnecessary conflict, with
desperate men; and the more determined citizens
formed the hasty reflection that the strangers might
be more easily mastered in the house, or perhaps in
the narrow streets which they had to traverse, than
when they stood drawn up and prepared for battle
upon the quay. They suffered them, therefore, to
proceed unmolested; and Cleveland, moving very
slowly, keeping his people close together, suffering
no one to press upon the flanks of his little detachment,
and making four men, who constituted
his rear-guard, turn round and face to the rear
from time to time, rendered it, by his caution, a
very dangerous task to make any attempt upon
them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>In this manner they ascended the narrow street
and reached the Council-house, where the Magistrates
were actually sitting, as the citizen had informed
Cleveland. Here the inhabitants began to
press forward, with the purpose of mingling with
the pirates, and availing themselves of the crowd
in the narrow entrance, to secure as many as they
could, without allowing them room for the free use
of their weapons. But this also had Cleveland foreseen,
and, ere entering the council-room, he caused
the entrance to be cleared and secured, commanding
four of his men to face down the street, and as many
to confront the crowd who were thrusting each other
from above. The burghers recoiled back from the
ferocious, swarthy, and sunburnt countenances, as
well as the levelled arms of these desperadoes, and
Cleveland, with the rest of his party, entered the
council-room, where the Magistrates were sitting in
council, with very little attendance. These gentlemen
were thus separated effectually from the citizens,
who looked to them for orders, and were perhaps
more completely at the mercy of Cleveland, than
he, with his little handful of men, could be said
to be at that of the multitude by whom they were
surrounded.</p>
<p>The Magistrates seemed sensible of their danger;
for they looked upon each other in some confusion,
when Cleveland thus addressed them:—</p>
<p>“Good morrow, gentlemen,—I hope there is
no unkindness betwixt us. I am come to talk with
you about getting supplies for my ship yonder in
the roadstead—we cannot sail without them.”</p>
<p>“Your ship, sir?” said the Provost, who was a
man of sense and spirit,—“how do we know that
you are her Captain?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Look at me,” said Cleveland, “and you will,
I think, scarce ask the question again.”</p>
<p>The Magistrate looked at Kim, and accordingly
did not think proper to pursue that part of the
enquiry, but proceeded to say—“And if you are
her Captain, whence comes she, and where is she
bound for? You look too much like a man-of-war’s
man to be master of a trader, and we know that you
do not belong to the British navy.”</p>
<p>“There are more men-of-war on the sea than
sail under the British flag,” replied Cleveland; “but
say that I were commander of a free-trader here,
willing to exchange tobacco, brandy, gin, and such
like, for cured fish and hides, why, I do not think
I deserve so very bad usage from the merchants of
Kirkwall as to deny me provisions for my money?”</p>
<p>“Look you, Captain,” said the Town-clerk, “it
is not that we are so very strait-laced neither—for,
when gentlemen of your cloth come this way, it is
as weel, as I tauld the Provost, just to do as the
collier did when he met the devil,—and that is, to
have naething to say to them, if they have naething
to say to us;—and there is the gentleman,” pointing
to Goffe, “that was Captain before you, and
may be Captain after you,”—(“The cuckold speaks
truth in that,” muttered Goffe,)—“he knows well
how handsomely we entertained him, till he and his
men took upon them to run through the town like
hellicat devils.—I see one of them there!—that was
the very fellow that stopped my servant-wench on
the street, as she carried the lantern home before
me, and insulted her before my face!”</p>
<p>“If it please your noble Mayorship’s honour
and glory,” said Derrick, the fellow at whom the
Town-clerk pointed, “it was not I that brought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the bit of a tender that carried the lantern in the
poop—it was quite a different sort of a person.”</p>
<p>“Who was it, then, sir?” said the Provost.</p>
<p>“Why, please your majesty’s worship,” said
Derrick, making several sea bows, and describing
as nearly as he could, the exterior of the worthy
Magistrate himself, “he was an elderly gentleman,—Dutch-built,
round in the stern, with a white wig
and a red nose—very like your majesty, I think;”
then, turning to a comrade, he added, “Jack, don’t
you think the fellow that wanted to kiss the pretty
girl with the lantern t’other night, was very like his
worship?”</p>
<p>“By G—, Tom Derrick,” answered the party
appealed to, “I believe it is the very man!”</p>
<p>“This is insolence which we can make you repent
of, gentlemen!” said the Magistrate, justly
irritated at their effrontery; “you have behaved
in this town, as if you were in an Indian village at
Madagascar. You yourself, Captain, if captain you
be, were at the head of another riot, no longer since
than yesterday. We will give you no provisions
till we know better whom we are supplying. And
do not think to bully us; when I shake this handkerchief
out at the window, which is at my elbow,
your ship goes to the bottom. Remember she lies
under the guns of our battery.”</p>
<p>“And how many of these guns are honeycombed,
Mr. Mayor?” said Cleveland. He put the question
by chance; but instantly perceived, from a sort of
confusion which the Provost in vain endeavoured to
hide, that the artillery of Kirkwall was not in the
best order. “Come, come, Mr. Mayor,” he said,
“bullying will go down with us as little as with
you. Your guns yonder will do more harm to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
poor old sailors who are to work them than to our
sloop; and if we bring a broadside to bear on the
town, why, your wives’ crockery will be in some
danger. And then to talk to us of seamen being a
little frolicsome ashore, why, when are they otherwise?
You have the Greenland whalers playing
the devil among you every now and then; and the
very Dutchmen cut capers in the streets of Kirkwall,
like porpoises before a gale of wind. I am
told you are a man of sense, and I am sure you
and I could settle this matter in the course of a
five-minutes’ palaver.”</p>
<p>“Well, sir,” said the Provost, “I will hear what
you have to say, if you will walk this way.”</p>
<p>Cleveland accordingly followed him into a small
interior apartment, and, when there, addressed the
Provost thus: “I will lay aside my pistols, sir, if
you are afraid of them.”</p>
<p>“D—n your pistols!” answered the Provost,
“I have served the King, and fear the smell of
powder as little as you do!”</p>
<p>“So much the better,” said Cleveland, “for you
will hear me the more coolly.—Now, sir, let us be
what perhaps you suspect us, or let us be any thing
else, what, in the name of Heaven, can you get by
keeping us here, but blows and bloodshed? For
which, believe me, we are much better provided
than you can pretend to be. The point is a plain
one—you are desirous to be rid of us—we are
desirous to be gone. Let us have the means of departure,
and we leave you instantly.”</p>
<p>“Look ye, Captain,” said the Provost, “I thirst
for no man’s blood. You are a pretty fellow, as
there were many among the buccaniers in my time—but
there is no harm in wishing you a better trade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
You should have the stores and welcome, for your
money, so you would make these seas clear of you.
But then, here lies the rub. The Halcyon frigate
is expected here in these parts immediately; when
she hears of you she will be at you; for there is
nothing the white lapelle loves better than a rover—you
are seldom without a cargo of dollars. Well,
he comes down, gets you under his stern”——</p>
<p>“Blows us into the air, if you please,” said
Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Nay, that must be as <i>you</i> please, Captain,” said
the Provost; “but then, what is to come of the
good town of Kirkwall, that has been packing and
peeling with the King’s enemies? The burgh will
be laid under a round fine, and it may be that the
Provost may not come off so easily.”</p>
<p>“Well, then,” said Cleveland, “I see where your
pinch lies. Now, suppose that I run round this
island of yours, and get into the roadstead at Stromness?
We could get what we want put on board
there, without Kirkwall or the Provost seeming to
have any hand in it; or, if it should be ever questioned,
your want of force, and our superior strength,
will make a sufficient apology.”</p>
<p>“That may be,” said the Provost; “but if I suffer
you to leave your present station, and go elsewhere,
I must have some security that you will not do harm
to the country.”</p>
<p>“And we,” said Cleveland, “must have some
security on our side, that you will not detain us,
by dribbling out our time till the Halcyon is on the
coast. Now, I am myself perfectly willing to continue
on shore as a hostage, on the one side, provided
you will give me your word not to betray me, and
send some magistrate, or person of consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
aboard the sloop, where his safety will be a guarantee
for mine.”</p>
<p>The Provost shook his head, and intimated it
would be difficult to find a person willing to place
himself as hostage in such a perilous condition; but
said he would propose the arrangement to such of
the council as were fit to be trusted with a matter
of such weight.</p>

</p>
<p>When the Provost and Cleveland had returned
into the public council-room, the former retired a
second time with such of his brethren as he thought
proper to advise with; and, while they were engaged
in discussing Cleveland’s proposal, refreshments
were offered to him and his party. These the
Captain permitted his people to partake of, but
with the greatest precaution against surprisal, one
party relieving the guard, whilst the others were at
their food.</p>
<p>He himself, in the meanwhile, walked up and
down the apartment, and conversed upon indifferent
subjects with those present, like a person quite at
his ease.</p>
<p>Amongst these individuals he saw, somewhat to
his surprise, Triptolemus Yellowley, who, chancing
to be at Kirkwall, had been summoned by the Magistrates,
as representative, in a certain degree, of
the Lord Chamberlain, to attend council on this
occasion. Cleveland immediately renewed the acquaintance
which he had formed with the agriculturist
at Burgh-Westra, and asked him his present
business in Orkney.</p>
<p>“Just to look after some of my little plans, Captain
Cleveland. I am weary of fighting with wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
beasts at Ephesus yonder, and I just cam ower to
see how my orchard was thriving, whilk I had
planted four or five miles from Kirkwall, it may
be a year bygane, and how the bees were thriving,
whereof I had imported nine skeps, for the improvement
of the country, and for the turning of
the heather-bloom into wax and honey.”</p>
<p>“And they thrive, I hope?” said Cleveland, who,
however little interested in the matter, sustained
the conversation, as if to break the chilly and embarrassed
silence which hung upon the company
assembled.</p>
<p>“Thrive!” replied Triptolemus; “they thrive
like every thing else in this country, and that is the
backward way.”</p>
<p>“Want of care, I suppose?” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“The contrary, sir, quite and clean the contrary,”
replied the Factor; “they died of ower muckle care,
like Lucky Christie’s chickens.—I asked to see the
skeps, and cunning and joyful did the fallow look
who was to have taken care of them—‘Had there
been ony body in charge but mysell,’ he said, ‘ye
might have seen the skeps, or whatever you ca’
them; but there wad hae been as mony solan-geese
as flees in them, if it hadna been for my four quarters;
for I watched them so closely, that I saw
them a’ creeping out at the little holes one sunny
morning, and if I had not stopped the leak on the
instant with a bit clay, the deil a bee, or flee, or
whatever they are, would have been left in the
skeps, as ye ca’ them!’—In a word, sir, he had
clagged up the hives, as if the puir things had had
the pestilence, and my bees were as dead as if they
had been smeaked—and so ends my hope, <i>generandi
gloria mellis</i>, as Virgilius hath it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“There is an end of your mead, then,” replied
Cleveland; “but what is your chance of cider?—How
does the orchard thrive?”</p>
<p>“O Captain! this same Solomon of the Orcadian
Ophir—I am sure no man need to send thither
to fetch either talents of gold or talents of sense!—I say,
this wise man had watered the young
apple-trees, in his great tenderness, with hot water,
and they are perished, root and branch! But what
avails grieving?—And I wish you would tell me,
instead, what is all the din that these good folks are
making about pirates? and what for all these ill-looking
men, that are armed like so mony Highlandmen,
assembled in the judgment-chamber?—for
I am just come from the other side of the island,
and I have heard nothing distinct about it.—And,
now I look at you yoursell, Captain, I think you
have mair of these foolish pistolets about you than
should suffice an honest man in quiet times?”</p>
<p>“And so I think, too,” said the pacific Triton,
old Haagen, who had been an unwilling follower
of the daring Montrose; “if you had been in the
Glen of Edderachyllis, when we were sae sair worried
by Sir John Worry”——</p>
<p>“You have forgot the whole matter, neighbour
Haagen,” said the Factor; “Sir John Urry was
on your side, and was ta’en with Montrose; by the
same token, he lost his head.”</p>
<p>“Did he?” said the Triton.—“I believe you
may be right; for he changed sides mair than anes,
and wha kens whilk he died for?—But always he
was there, and so was I;—a fight there was, and I
never wish to see another!”</p>
<p>The entrance of the Provost here interrupted
their desultory conversation.—“We have deter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>mined,”
he said, “Captain, that your ship shall go
round to Stromness, or Scalpa-flow, to take in stores,
in order that there may be no more quarrels between
the Fair folks and your seamen. And as you
wish to stay on shore to see the Fair, we intend to
send a respectable gentleman on board your vessel
to pilot her round the Mainland, as the navigation
is but ticklish.”</p>
<p>“Spoken like a quiet and sensible magistrate,
Mr. Mayor,” said Cleveland, “and no otherwise
than as I expected.—And what gentleman is to
honour our quarter-deck during my absence?”</p>
<p>“We have fixed that, too, Captain Cleveland,”
said the Provost; “you may be sure we were each
more desirous than another to go upon so pleasant
a voyage, and in such good company; but being
Fair time, most of us have some affairs in hand—I
myself, in respect of my office, cannot be well
spared—the eldest Bailie’s wife is lying-in—the
Treasurer does not agree with the sea—two Bailies
have the gout—the other two are absent from town—and
the other fifteen members of council are all
engaged on particular business.”</p>
<p>“All that I can tell you, Mr. Mayor,” said Cleveland,
raising his voice, “is, that I expect”——</p>
<p>“A moment’s patience, if you please, Captain,”
said the Provost, interrupting him—“So that we
have come to the resolution that our worthy Mr.
Triptolemus Yellowley, who is Factor to the Lord
Chamberlain of these islands, shall, in respect of
his official situation, be preferred to the honour and
pleasure of accompanying you.”</p>
<p>“Me!” said the astonished Triptolemus; “what
the devil should I do going on your voyages?—my
business is on dry land!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“The gentlemen want a pilot,” said the Provost,
whispering to him, “and there is no eviting to give
them one.”</p>
<p>“Do they want to go bump on shore, then?” said
the Factor—“how the devil should I pilot them,
that never touched rudder in my life?”</p>
<p>“Hush!—hush!—be silent!” said the Provost;
“if the people of this town heard ye say such a
word, your utility, and respect, and rank, and every
thing else, is clean gone!—No man is any thing
with us island folks, unless he can hand, reef, and
steer.—Besides, it is but a mere form; and we
will send old Pate Sinclair to help you. You will
have nothing to do but to eat, drink, and be merry
all day.”</p>
<p>“Eat and drink!” said the Factor, not able to
comprehend exactly why this piece of duty was
pressed upon him so hastily, and yet not very capable
of resisting or extricating himself from the
toils of the more knowing Provost—“Eat and
drink?—that is all very well; but, to speak truth,
the sea does not agree with me any more than with
the Treasurer; and I have always a better appetite
for eating and drinking ashore.”</p>
<p>“Hush! hush! hush!” again said the Provost,
in an under tone of earnest expostulation; “would
you actually ruin your character out and out?—A
Factor of the High Chamberlain of the Isles of Orkney
and Zetland, and not like the sea!—you might
as well say you are a Highlander, and do not like
whisky!”</p>
<p>“You must settle it somehow, gentlemen,” said
Captain Cleveland; “it is time we were under
weigh.—Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, are we to be
honoured with your company?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“I am sure, Captain Cleveland,” stammered the
Factor, “I would have no objection to go anywhere
with you—only”——</p>
<p>“He has no objection,” said the Provost, catching
at the first limb of the sentence, without awaiting
the conclusion.</p>
<p>“He has no objection,” cried the Treasurer.</p>
<p>“He has no objection,” sung out the whole four
Bailies together; and the fifteen Councillors, all
catching up the same phrase of assent, repeated it in
chorus, with the additions of—“good man”—“public-spirited”—“honourable
gentleman”—“burgh
eternally obliged”—“where will you find such a
worthy Factor?” and so forth.</p>
<p>Astonished and confused at the praises with which
he was overwhelmed on all sides, and in no shape
understanding the nature of the transaction that
was going forward, the astounded and overwhelmed
agriculturist became incapable of resisting the part
of the Kirkwall Curtius thus insidiously forced upon
him, and was delivered up by Captain Cleveland to
his party, with the strictest injunctions to treat him
with honour and attention. Goffe and his companions
began now to lead him off, amid the applauses
of the whole meeting, after the manner in which the
victim of ancient days was garlanded and greeted
by shouts, when consigned to the priests, for the
purpose of being led to the altar, and knocked on
the head, a sacrifice for the commonweal. It was
while they thus conducted, and in a manner forced
him out of the Council-chamber, that poor Triptolemus,
much alarmed at finding that Cleveland, in
whom he had some confidence, was to remain behind
the party, tried, when just going out at the
door, the effect of one remonstrating bellow.—“Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
but, Provost!—Captain!—Bailies!—Treasurer!
Councillors!—if Captain Cleveland does not go
aboard to protect me, it is nae bargain, and go I
will not, unless I am trailed with cart-ropes!”</p>
<p>His protest was, however, drowned in the unanimous
chorus of the Magistrates and Councillors,
returning him thanks for his public spirit—wishing
him a good voyage—and praying to Heaven for
his happy and speedy return. Stunned and overwhelmed,
and thinking, if he had any distinct
thoughts at all, that remonstrance was vain, where
friends and strangers seemed alike determined to
carry the point against him, Triptolemus, without
farther resistance, suffered himself to be conducted
into the street, where the pirate’s boat’s-crew, assembling
around him, began to move slowly towards
the quay, many of the townsfolk following out of
curiosity, but without any attempt at interference
or annoyance; for the pacific compromise which the
dexterity of the first Magistrate had achieved, was
unanimously approved of as a much better settlement
of the disputes betwixt them and the strangers,
than might have been attained by the dubious issue
of an appeal to arms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as they went slowly along, Triptolemus
had time to study the appearance, countenance,
and dress, of those into whose hands he had
been thus delivered, and began to imagine that he
read in their looks, not only the general expression
of a desperate character, but some sinister intentions
directed particularly towards himself. He
was alarmed by the truculent looks of Goffe, in particular,
who, holding his arm with a gripe which
resembled in delicacy of touch the compression of
a smith’s vice, cast on him from the outer corner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
his eye oblique glances, like those which the eagle
throws upon the prey which she has clutched, ere
yet she proceeds, as it is technically called, to plume
it. At length Yellowley’s fears got so far the better
of his prudence, that he fairly asked his terrible
conductor, in a sort of crying whisper, “Are you
going to murder me, Captain, in the face of the
laws baith of God and man?”</p>
<p>“Hold your peace, if you are wise,” said Goffe,
who had his own reasons for desiring to increase
the panic of his captive; “we have not murdered
a man these three months, and why should you put
us in mind of it?”</p>
<p>“You are but joking, I hope, good worthy Captain!”
replied Triptolemus. “This is worse than
witches, dwarfs, dirking of whales, and cowping of
cobles, put all together!—this is an away-ganging
crop, with a vengeance!—What good, in Heaven’s
name, would murdering me do to you?”</p>
<p>“We might have some pleasure in it, at least,”
said Goffe.—“Look these fellows in the face, and
see if you see one among them that would not
rather kill a man than let it alone?—But we will
speak more of that when you have first had a taste
of the bilboes—unless, indeed, you come down with
a handsome round handful of Chili boards<a id="FNanchor2_37_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_37_41">[37]</a> for
your ransom.”</p>
<p>“As I shall live by bread, Captain,” answered
the Factor, “that misbegotten dwarf has carried off
the whole hornful of silver!”</p>
<p>“A cat-and-nine-tails will make you find it
again,” said Goffe, gruffly; “flogging and pickling
is an excellent receipt to bring a man’s wealth into
his mind—twisting a bowstring round his skull till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the eyes start a little, is a very good remembrancer
too.”</p>
<p>“Captain,” replied Yellowley, stoutly, “I have
no money—seldom can improvers have. We turn
pasture to tillage, and barley into aits, and heather
into greensward, and the poor <i>yarpha</i>, as the benighted
creatures here call their peat-bogs, into
baittle grass-land; but we seldom make any thing
of it that comes back to our ain pouch. The carles
and the cart-avers make it all, and the carles and
the cart-avers eat it all, and the deil clink doun
with it!”</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said Goffe, “if you be really a
poor fellow, as you pretend, I’ll stand your friend;”
then, inclining his head so as to reach the ear of
the Factor, who stood on tiptoe with anxiety, he
said, “If you love your life, do not enter the boat
with us.”</p>
<p>“But how am I to get away from you, while you
hold me so fast by the arm, that I could not get off
if the whole year’s crop of Scotland depended on
it?”</p>
<p>“Hark ye, you gudgeon,” said Goffe, “just when
you come to the water’s edge, and when the fellows
are jumping in and taking their oars, slue yourself
round suddenly to the larboard—I will let go your
arm—and then cut and run for your life!”</p>
<p>Triptolemus did as he was desired, Goffe’s willing
hand relaxed the grasp as he had promised, the
agriculturist trundled off like a football that has
just received a strong impulse from the foot of one
of the players, and, with celerity which surprised
himself as well as all beholders, fled through the
town of Kirkwall. Nay, such was the impetus of
his retreat, that, as if the grasp of the pirate was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
still open to pounce upon him, he never stopped till
he had traversed the whole town, and attained the
open country on the other side. They who had
seen him that day—his hat and wig lost in the
sudden effort he had made to bolt forward, his cravat
awry, and his waistcoat unbuttoned,—and who had
an opportunity of comparing his round spherical
form and short legs with the portentous speed at
which he scoured through the street, might well
say, that if Fury ministers arms, Fear confers wings.
His very mode of running seemed to be that peculiar
to his fleecy care, for, like a ram in the midst of
his race, he ever and anon encouraged himself by
a great bouncing attempt at a leap, though there
were no obstacles in his way.</p>
<p>There was no pursuit after the agriculturist; and
though a musket or two were presented, for the purpose
of sending a leaden messenger after him, yet
Goffe, turning peace-maker for once in his life, so
exaggerated the dangers that would attend a breach
of the truce with the people of Kirkwall, that he
prevailed upon the boat’s crew to forbear any active
hostilities, and to pull off for their vessel with all
dispatch.</p>
<p>The burghers, who regarded the escape of Triptolemus
as a triumph on their side, gave the boat
three cheers, by way of an insulting farewell; while
the Magistrates, on the other hand, entertained
great anxiety respecting the probable consequences
of this breach of articles between them and the
pirates; and, could they have seized upon the
fugitive very privately, instead of complimenting
him with a civic feast in honour of the agility
which he displayed, it is likely they might have delivered
the runaway hostage once more into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
hands of his foemen. But it was impossible to set
their face publicly to such an act of violence, and
therefore they contented themselves with closely
watching Cleveland, whom they determined to make
responsible for any aggression which might be attempted
by the pirates. Cleveland, on his part,
easily conjectured that the motive which Goffe had
for suffering the hostage to escape, was to leave him
answerable for all consequences, and, relying more
on the attachment and intelligence of his friend and
adherent, Frederick Altamont, alias Jack Bunce,
than on any thing else, expected the result with
considerable anxiety, since the Magistrates, though
they continued to treat him with civility, plainly intimated
they would regulate his treatment by the
behaviour of the crew, though he no longer commanded
them.</p>
<p>It was not, however, without some reason that he
reckoned on the devoted fidelity of Bunce; for no
sooner did that trusty adherent receive from Goffe,
and the boat’s crew, the news of the escape of Triptolemus,
than he immediately concluded it had been
favoured by the late Captain, in order that, Cleveland
being either put to death or consigned to
hopeless imprisonment, Goffe might be called upon
to resume the command of the vessel.</p>
<p>“But the drunken old boatswain shall miss his
mark,” said Bunce to his confederate Fletcher; “or
else I am contented to quit the name of Altamont,
and be called Jack Bunce, or Jack Dunce, if you
like it better, to the end of the chapter.”</p>
<p>Availing himself accordingly of a sort of nautical
eloquence, which his enemies termed slack-jaw,
Bunce set before the crew, in a most animated manner,
the disgrace which they all sustained, by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Captain remaining, as he was pleased to term it, in
the bilboes, without any hostage to answer for his
safety; and succeeded so far, that, besides exciting
a good deal of discontent against Goffe, he brought
the crew to the resolution of seizing the first vessel
of a tolerable appearance, and declaring that the
ship, crew, and cargo, should be dealt with according
to the usage which Cleveland should receive on
shore. It was judged at the same time proper to
try the faith of the Orcadians, by removing from
the roadstead of Kirkwall, and going round to that
of Stromness, where, according to the treaty betwixt
Provost Torfe and Captain Cleveland, they were to
victual their sloop. They resolved, in the meantime,
to intrust the command of the vessel to a
council, consisting of Goffe, the boatswain, and
Bunce himself, until Cleveland should be in a situation
to resume his command.</p>
<p>These resolutions having been proposed and acceded
to, they weighed anchor, and got their sloop
under sail, without experiencing any opposition or
annoyance from the battery, which relieved them
of one important apprehension incidental to their

</p>
<p>A very handsome brig, which, with several other
vessels, was the property of Magnus Troil, the great
Zetland Udaller, had received on board that Magnate
himself, his two lovely daughters, and the facetious
Claud Halcro, who, for friendship’s sake
chiefly, and the love of beauty proper to his poetical
calling, attended them on their journey from
Zetland to the capital of Orkney, to which Norna
had referred them, as the place where her mystical
oracles should at length receive a satisfactory
explanation.</p>
<p>They passed, at a distance, the tremendous cliffs
of the lonely spot of earth called the Fair Isle, which,
at an equal distance from either archipelago, lies in
the sea which divides Orkney from Zetland; and at
length, after some baffling winds, made the Start of
Sanda. Off the headland so named, they became involved
in a strong current, well known, by those
who frequent these seas, as the Roost of the Start,
which carried them considerably out of their course,
and, joined to an adverse wind, forced them to keep
on the east side of the island of Stronsa, and, finally
compelled them to lie by for the night in Papa
Sound, since the navigation in dark or thick weather,
amongst so many low islands, is neither pleasant
nor safe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>On the ensuing morning they resumed their voyage
under more favourable auspices; and, coasting
along the island of Stronsa, whose flat, verdant, and
comparatively fertile shores, formed a strong contrast
to the dun hills and dark cliffs of their own
islands, they doubled the cape called the Lambhead,
and stood away for Kirkwall.</p>
<p>They had scarce opened the beautiful bay betwixt
Pomona and Shapinsha, and the sisters were
admiring the massive church of Saint Magnus, as it
was first seen to rise from amongst the inferior
buildings of Kirkwall, when the eyes of Magnus,
and of Claud Halcro, were attracted by an object
which they thought more interesting. This was an
armed sloop, with her sails set, which had just left
the anchorage in the bay, and was running before
the wind by which the brig of the Udaller was
beating in.</p>
<p>“A tight thing that, by my ancestors’ bones!”
said the old Udaller; “but I cannot make out of
what country, as she shows no colours. Spanish
built, I should think her.”</p>
<p>“Ay, ay,” said Claud Halcro, “she has all the
look of it. She runs before the wind that we must
battle with, which is the wonted way of the world.
As glorious John says,—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘With roomy deck, and guns of mighty strength<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves,</span><br>
Deep in her draught, and warlike in her length,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves.’”</span><br>
</p>
<p>Brenda could not help telling Halcro, when he
had spouted this stanza with great enthusiasm,
“that though the description was more like a first-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>rate
than a sloop, yet the simile of the sea-wasp
served but indifferently for either.”</p>
<p>“A sea-wasp?” said Magnus, looking with some
surprise, as the sloop, shifting her course, suddenly
bore down on them: “Egad, I wish she may not
show us presently that she has a sting!”</p>
<p>What the Udaller said in jest, was fulfilled in
earnest; for, without hoisting colours, or hailing,
two shots were discharged from the sloop, one of
which ran dipping and dancing upon the water,
just ahead of the Zetlander’s bows, while the other
went through his main-sail.</p>
<p>Magnus caught up a speaking-trumpet, and hailed
the sloop, to demand what she was, and what was
the meaning of this unprovoked aggression. He
was only answered by the stern command,—“Down
top-sails instantly, and lay your main-sail to the
mast—you shall see who we are presently.”</p>
<p>There were no means within the reach of possibility
by which obedience could be evaded, where
it would instantly have been enforced by a broadside;
and, with much fear on the part of the sisters
and Claud Halcro, mixed with anger and astonishment
on that of the Udaller, the brig lay-to to await
the commands of the captors.</p>
<p>The sloop immediately lowered a boat, with six
armed hands, commanded by Jack Bunce, which
rowed directly for their prize. As they approached
her, Claud Halcro whispered to the Udaller,—“If
what we hear of buccaniers be true, these men, with
their silk scarfs and vests, have the very cut of them.”</p>
<p>“My daughters! my daughters!” muttered Magnus
to himself, with such an agony as only a father
could feel,—“Go down below, and hide yourselves,
girls, while I”—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>—</p>
<p>He threw down his speaking-trumpet, and seized
on a handspike, while his daughters, more afraid of
the consequences of his fiery temper to himself than
of any thing else, hung round him, and begged him
to make no resistance. Claud Halcro united his
entreaties, adding, “It were best pacify the fellows
with fair words. They might,” he said, “be Dunkirkers,
or insolent man-of-war’s men on a frolic.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” answered Magnus, “it is the sloop
which the Jagger told us of. But I will take your
advice—I will have patience for these girls’ sakes;
yet”——</p>
<p>He had no time to conclude the sentence, for
Bunce jumped on board with his party, and drawing
his cutlass, struck it upon the companion-ladder,
and declared the ship was theirs.</p>
<p>“By what warrant or authority do you stop us on
the high seas?” said Magnus.</p>
<p>“Here are half a dozen of warrants,” said Bunce,
showing the pistols which were hung round him,
according to a pirate-fashion already mentioned,
“choose which you like, old gentleman, and you
shall have the perusal of it presently.”</p>
<p>“That is to say, you intend to rob us?” said
Magnus.—“So be it—we have no means to help
it—only be civil to the women, and take what you
please from the vessel. There is not much, but I will
and can make it worth more, if you use us well.”</p>
<p>“Civil to the women!” said Fletcher, who had
also come on board with the gang—“when were
we else than civil to them? ay, and kind to boot?—Look
here, Jack Bunce!—what a trim-going
little thing here is!—By G—, she shall make a
cruize with us, come of old Squaretoes what will!”</p>
<p>He seized upon the terrified Brenda with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
hand, and insolently pulled back with the other
the hood of the mantle in which she had muffled
herself.</p>
<p>“Help, father!—help, Minna!” exclaimed the
affrighted girl; unconscious, at the moment, that
they were unable to render her assistance.</p>
<p>Magnus again uplifted the handspike, but Bunce
stopped his hand.—“Avast, father!” he said, “or
you will make a bad voyage of it presently—And
you, Fletcher, let go the girl!”</p>
<p>“And, d—n me! why should I let her go?” said
Fletcher.</p>
<p>“Because I command you, Dick,” said the other,
“and because I’ll make it a quarrel else.—And
now let me know, beauties, is there one of you
bears that queer heathen name of Minna, for which
I have a certain sort of regard?”</p>
<p>“Gallant sir!” said Halcro, “unquestionably it
is because you have some poetry in your heart.”</p>
<p>“I have had enough of it in my mouth in my
time,” answered Bunce; “but that day is by, old
gentleman—however, I shall soon find out which
of these girls is Minna.—Throw back your mufflings
from your faces, and don’t be afraid, my Lindamiras;
no one here shall meddle with you to do
you wrong. On my soul, two pretty wenches!—I
wish I were at sea in an egg-shell, and a rock
under my lee-bow, if I would wish a better leaguer-lass
than the worst of them!—Hark you, my girls;
which of you would like to swing in a rover’s hammock?—you
should have gold for the gathering!”</p>
<p>The terrified maidens clung close together, and
grew pale at the bold and familiar language of the
desperate libertine.</p>
<p>“Nay, don’t be frightened,” said he; “no one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
shall serve under the noble Altamont but by her
own free choice—there is no pressing amongst
gentlemen of fortune. And do not look so shy
upon me neither, as if I spoke of what you never
thought of before. One of you, at least, has heard
of Captain Cleveland, the Rover.”</p>
<p>Brenda grew still paler, but the blood mounted
at once in Minna’s cheeks, on hearing the name of
her lover thus unexpectedly introduced; for the
scene was in itself so confounding, that the idea of
the vessel’s being the consort of which Cleveland
had spoken at Burgh-Westra, had occurred to no
one save the Udaller.</p>
<p>“I see how it is,” said Bunce, with a familiar
nod, “and I will hold my course accordingly.—You
need not be afraid of any injury, father,” he
added, addressing Magnus familiarly; “and though
I have made many a pretty girl pay tribute in my
time, yet yours shall go ashore without either
wrong or ransom.”</p>
<p>“If you will assure me of that,” said Magnus;
“you are as welcome to the brig and cargo, as ever
I made man welcome to a can of punch.”</p>
<p>“And it is no bad thing that same can of punch,”
said Bunce, “if we had any one here that could mix
it well.”</p>
<p>“I will do it,” said Claud Halcro, “with any
man that ever squeezed lemon—Eric Scambester,
the punch-maker of Burgh-Westra, being alone
excepted.”</p>
<p>“And you are within a grapnel’s length of him,
too,” said the Udaller.—“Go down below, my
girls,” he added, “and send up the rare old man,
and the punch-bowl.”</p>
<p>“The punch-bowl!” said Fletcher; “I say, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
bucket, d—n me!—Talk of bowls in the cabin of a
paltry merchantman, but not to gentlemen-strollers—rovers,
I would say,” correcting himself, as he
observed that Bunce looked sour at the mistake.</p>
<p>“And I say, these two pretty girls shall stay on
deck, and fill my can,” said Bunce; “I deserve
some attendance, at least, for all my generosity.”</p>
<p>“And they shall fill mine, too,” said Fletcher—“they
shall fill it to the brim!—and I will have
a kiss for every drop they spill—broil me if I
won’t!”</p>
<p>“Why, then, I tell you, you shan’t!” said Bunce;
“for I’ll be d—d if any one shall kiss Minna but
one, and that’s neither you nor I; and her other
little bit of a consort shall ’scape for company;—there
are plenty of willing wenches in Orkney.—And
so, now I think on it, these girls shall go down
below, and bolt themselves into the cabin; and we
shall have the punch up here on deck, <i>al fresco</i>, as
the old gentleman proposes.”</p>
<p>“Why, Jack, I wish you knew your own mind,”
said Fletcher; “I have been your messmate these
two years, and I love you; and yet flay me like a
wild bullock, if you have not as many humours as
a monkey!—And what shall we have to make a
little fun of, since you have sent the girls down
below?”</p>
<p>“Why, we will have Master Punch-maker here,”
answered Bunce, “to give us toasts, and sing us
songs.—And, in the meantime, you there, stand
by sheets and tacks, and get her under way!—and
you, steersman, as you would keep your brains in
your skull, keep her under the stern of the sloop.—If
you attempt to play us any trick, I will scuttle
your sconce as if it were an old calabash!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>”</p>
<p>The vessel was accordingly got under way, and
moved slowly on in the wake of the sloop, which,
as had been previously agreed upon, held her course,
not to return to the Bay of Kirkwall, but for an
excellent roadstead called Inganess Bay, formed by
a promontory which extends to the eastward two
or three miles from the Orcadian metropolis, and
where the vessels might conveniently lie at anchor,
while the rovers maintained any communication
with the Magistrates which the new state of things
seemed to require.</p>
<p>Meantime Claud Halcro had exerted his utmost
talents in compounding a bucketful of punch for
the use of the pirates, which they drank out of large
cans; the ordinary seamen, as well as Bunce and
Fletcher, who acted as officers, dipping them into
the bucket with very little ceremony, as they came
and went upon their duty. Magnus, who was particularly
apprehensive that liquor might awaken the
brutal passions of these desperadoes, was yet so
much astonished at the quantities which he saw
them drink, without producing any visible effect
upon their reason, that he could not help expressing
his surprise to Bunce himself, who, wild as he was,
yet appeared by far the most civil and conversable
of his party, and whom he was, perhaps, desirous
to conciliate, by a compliment of which all boon
topers know the value.</p>
<p>“Bones of Saint Magnus!” said the Udaller, “I
used to think I took off my can like a gentleman;
but to see your men swallow, Captain, one would
think their stomachs were as bottomless as the hole
of Laifell in Foula, which I have sounded myself
with a line of an hundred fathoms. By my soul, the
Bicker of Saint Magnus were but a sip to them!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“In our way of life, sir,” answered Bunce, “there
is no stint till duty calls, or the puncheon is drunk
out.”</p>
<p>“By my word, sir,” said Claud Halcro, “I believe
there is not one of your people but could
drink out the mickle bicker of Scarpa, which was
always offered to the Bishop of Orkney brimful of
the best bummock that ever was brewed.”<a id="FNanchor2_38_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_38_42">[38]</a></p>
<p>“If drinking could make them bishops,” said
Bunce, “I should have a reverend crew of them;
but as they have no other clerical qualities about
them, I do not propose that they shall get drunk
to-day; so we will cut our drink with a song.”</p>
<p>“And I’ll sing it, by ——!” said or swore Dick
Fletcher, and instantly struck up the old ditty—</p>
<p class="poem">
“It was a ship, and a ship of fame,<br>
Launch’d off the stocks, bound for the main,<br>
With an hundred and fifty brisk young men,<br>
All pick’d and chosen every one.”<br>
</p>
<p>“I would sooner be keel-hauled than hear that
song over again,” said Bunce; “and confound your
lantern jaws, you can squeeze nothing else out of
them!”</p>
<p>“By ——,” said Fletcher, “I will sing my song,
whether you like it or no;” and again he sung, with
the doleful tone of a north-easter whistling through
sheet and shrouds,—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Captain Glen was our captain’s name;<br>
A very gallant and brisk young man;<br>
As bold a sailor as e’er went to sea,<br>
And we were bound for High Barbary.”<br>
</p>
<p>“I tell you again,” said Bunce, “we will have
none of your screech-owl music here; and I’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
d—d if you shall sit here and make that infernal
noise!”</p>
<p>“Why, then, I’ll tell you what,” said Fletcher,
getting up, “I’ll sing when I walk about, and I hope
there is no harm in that, Jack Bunce.” And so,
getting up from his seat, he began to walk up and
down the sloop, croaking out his long and disastrous
ballad.</p>
<p>“You see how I manage them,” said Bunce, with
a smile of self-applause—“allow that fellow two
strides on his own way, and you make a mutineer of
him for life. But I tie him strict up, and he follows
me as kindly as a fowler’s spaniel after he has
got a good beating.—And now your toast and your
song, sir,” addressing Halcro; “or rather your song
without your toast. I have got a toast for myself.
Here is success to all roving blades, and confusion
to all honest men!”</p>
<p>“I should be sorry to drink that toast, if I could
help it,” said Magnus Troil.</p>
<p>“What! you reckon yourself one of the honest
folks, I warrant?” said Bunce.—“Tell me your
trade, and I’ll tell you what I think of it. As for
the punch-maker here, I knew him at first glance to
be a tailor, who has, therefore, no more pretensions
to be honest, than he has not to be mangy. But
you are some High-Dutch skipper, I warrant me,
that tramples on the cross when he is in Japan, and
denies his religion for a day’s gain.”</p>
<p>“No,” replied the Udaller, “I am a gentleman of
Zetland.”</p>
<p>“O, what!” retorted the satirical Mr. Bunce, “you
are come from the happy climate where gin is a
groat a-bottle, and where there is daylight for ever?”</p>
<p>“At your service, Captain,” said the Udaller, sup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>pressing
with much pain some disposition to resent
these jests on his country, although under every risk,
and at all disadvantage.</p>
<p>“At <i>my</i> service!” said Bunce—“Ay, if there
was a rope stretched from the wreck to the beach,
you would be at my service to cut the hawser, make
<i>floatsome</i> and <i>jetsome</i> of ship and cargo, and well if
you did not give me a rap on the head with the back
of the cutty-axe; and you call yourself honest?
But never mind—here goes the aforesaid toast—and
do you sing me a song, Mr. Fashioner; and look
it be as good as your punch.”</p>
<p>Halcro, internally praying for the powers of a new
Timotheus, to turn his strain and check his auditor’s
pride, as glorious John had it, began a heart-soothing
ditty with the following lines:—</p>
<p class="poem">
“Maidens fresh as fairest rose,<br>
Listen to this lay of mine.”<br>
</p>
<p>“I will hear nothing of maidens or roses,” said
Bunce; “it puts me in mind what sort of a cargo
we have got on board; and, by ——, I will be true
to my messmate and my captain as long as I can!—And
now I think on’t, I’ll have no more punch
either—that last cup made innovation, and I am
not to play Cassio to-night—and if I drink not, nobody
else shall.”</p>
<p>So saying, he manfully kicked over the bucket,
which, notwithstanding the repeated applications
made to it, was still half full, got up from his seat,
shook himself a little to rights, as he expressed it,
cocked his hat, and, walking the quarter-deck with
an air of dignity, gave, by word and signal, the orders
for bringing the ships to anchor, which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
readily obeyed by both, Goffe being then, in all probability,
past any rational state of interference.</p>
<p>The Udaller, in the meantime, condoled with
Halcro on their situation. “It is bad enough,” said
the tough old Norseman; “for these are rank rogues—and
yet, were it not for the girls, I should not
fear them. That young vapouring fellow, who seems
to command, is not such a born devil as he might
have been.”</p>
<p>“He has queer humours, though,” said Halcro;
“and I wish we were loose from him. To kick
down a bucket half full of the best punch ever was
made, and to cut me short in the sweetest song I
ever wrote,—I promise you, I do not know what he
may do next—it is next door to madness.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ships being brought to anchor,
the valiant Lieutenant Bunce called upon Fletcher,
and, resuming his seat by his unwilling passengers,
he told them they should see what message he was
about to send to the wittols of Kirkwall, as they
were something concerned in it. “It shall run in
Dick’s name,” he said, “as well as in mine. I love
to give the poor young fellow a little countenance
now and then—don’t I, Dick, you d—d stupid ass?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, Jack Bunce,” said Dick, “I can’t say
but as you do—only you are always bullocking one
about something or other, too—but, howsomdever,
d’ye see”——</p>
<p>“Enough said—belay your jaw, Dick,” said
Bunce, and proceeded to write his epistle, which,
being read aloud, proved to be of the following tenor:</p>
<div class="psmall"><p>“For the Mayor and Aldermen of Kirkwall—Gentlemen,
As, contrary to your good faith given, you have
not sent us on board a hostage for the safety of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Captain, remaining on shore at your request, these come
to tell you, we are not thus to be trifled with. We
have already in our possession, a brig, with a family of
distinction, its owners and passengers; and as you deal
with our Captain, so will we deal with them in every
respect. And as this is the first, so assure yourselves
it shall not be the last damage which we will
do to your town and trade, if you do not send on
board our Captain, and supply us with stores according
to treaty.</p>
<p>“Given on board the brig Mergoose of Burgh-Westra,
lying in Inganess Bay. Witness our hands,
commanders of the Fortune’s Favourite, and gentlemen
adventurers.”</p></div>
<p>He then subscribed himself Frederick Altamont,
and handed the letter to Fletcher, who read the
said subscription with much difficulty; and, admiring
the sound of it very much, swore he would have
a new name himself, and the rather that Fletcher
was the most crabbed word to spell and conster, he
believed, in the whole dictionary. He subscribed
himself accordingly, Timothy Tugmutton.</p>
<p>“Will you not add a few lines to the coxcombs?”
said Bunce, addressing Magnus.</p>
<p>“Not I,” returned the Udaller, stubborn in his
ideas of right and wrong, even in so formidable an
emergency. “The Magistrates of Kirkwall know
their duty, and were I they”——But here the
recollection that his daughters were at the mercy of
these ruffians, blanked the bold visage of Magnus
Troil, and checked the defiance which was just
about to issue from his lips.</p>
<p>“D—n me,” said Bunce, who easily conjectured
what was passing in the mind of his prisoner—“that
pause would have told well on the stage—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
would have brought down pit, box, and gallery,
egad, as Bayes has it.”</p>
<p>“I will hear nothing of Bayes,” said Claud Halcro,
(himself a little elevated,) “it is an impudent
satire on glorious John; but he tickled Buckingham
off for it—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘In the first rank of these did Zimri stand;<br>
A man so various’”——<br>
</p>
<p>“Hold your peace!” said Bunce, drowning the
voice of the admirer of Dryden in louder and more
vehement asseveration, “the Rehearsal is the best
farce ever was written—and I’ll make him kiss the
gunner’s daughter that denies it. D—n me, I was
the best Prince Prettyman ever walked the boards—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘Sometimes a fisher’s son, sometimes a prince.’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">But let us to business.—Hark ye, old gentleman,”
(to Magnus,) “you have a sort of sulkiness about
you, for which some of my profession would cut
your ears out of your head, and broil them for your
dinner with red pepper. I have known Goffe do
so to a poor devil, for looking sour and dangerous
when he saw his sloop go to Davy Jones’s locker
with his only son on board. But I’m a spirit of
another sort; and if you or the ladies are ill used,
it shall be the Kirkwall people’s fault, and not mine,
and that’s fair; and so you had better let them know
your condition, and your circumstances, and so forth,—and
that’s fair, too.”</p>
<p>Magnus, thus exhorted, took up the pen, and
attempted to write; but his high spirit so struggled
with his paternal anxiety, that his hand refused its
office. “I cannot help it,” he said, after one or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
illegible attempts to write—“I cannot form a letter,
if all our lives depended upon it.”</p>
<p>And he could not, with his utmost efforts, so suppress
the convulsive emotions which he experienced,
but that they agitated his whole frame. The willow
which bends to the tempest, often escapes better
than the oak which resists it; and so, in great calamities,
it sometimes happens, that light and frivolous
spirits recover their elasticity and presence of mind
sooner than those of a loftier character. In the
present case, Claud Halcro was fortunately able to
perform the task which the deeper feelings of his
friend and patron refused. He took the pen, and, in
as few words as possible, explained the situation in
which they were placed, and the cruel risks to which
they were exposed, insinuating at the same time, as
delicately as he could express it, that, to the magistrates
of the country, the life and honour of its
citizens should be a dearer object than even the apprehension
or punishment of the guilty; taking care,
however, to qualify the last expression as much as
possible, for fear of giving umbrage to the pirates.</p>
<p>Bunce read over the letter, which fortunately met
his approbation; and, on seeing the name of Claud
Halcro at the bottom, he exclaimed, in great surprise,
and with more energetic expressions of asseveration
than we choose to record—“Why, you are the little
fellow that played the fiddle to old Manager Gadabout’s
company, at Hogs Norton, the first season I
came out there! I thought I knew your catchword
of glorious John.”</p>
<p>At another time this recognition might not have
been very grateful to Halcro’s minstrel pride; but,
as matters stood with him, the discovery of a golden

instantly remembered the very hopeful young performer
who came out in Don Sebastian, and judiciously
added, that the muse of glorious John had
never received such excellent support during the
time that he was first (he might have added, and
only) violin to Mr. Gadabout’s company.</p>
<p>“Why, yes,” said Bunce, “I believe you are
right—I think I might have shaken the scene as
well as Booth or Betterton either. But I was destined
to figure on other boards,” (striking his foot
upon the deck,) “and I believe I must stick by
them, till I find no board at all to support me. But
now, old acquaintance, I will do something for you—slue
yourself this way a bit—I would have you
solus.” They leaned over the taffrail, while Bunce
whispered with more seriousness than he usually
showed, “I am sorry for this honest old heart of
Norway pine—blight me if I am not—and for the
daughters too—besides, I have my own reasons for
befriending one of them. I can be a wild fellow
with a willing lass of the game; but to such decent
and innocent creatures—d—n me, I am Scipio at
Numantia, and Alexander in the tent of Darius.
You remember how I touch off Alexander?” (here
he started into heroics.)</p>
<p class="poem">
“‘Thus from the grave I rise to save my love;<br>
All draw your swords, with wings of lightning move.<br>
When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay—<br>
’Tis beauty calls, and glory shows the way.’”<br>
</p>
<p>Claud Halcro failed not to bestow the necessary
commendations on his declamation, declaring, that,
in his opinion as an honest man, he had always
thought Mr. Altamont’s giving that speech far superior
in tone and energy to Betterton.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>Bunce, or Altamont, wrung his hand tenderly.
“Ah, you flatter me, my dear friend,” he said; “yet,
why had not the public some of your judgment!—I
should not then have been at this pass. Heaven
knows, my dear Mr. Halcro—Heaven knows with
what pleasure I could keep you on board with me,
just that I might have one friend who loves as much
to hear, as I do to recite, the choicest pieces of our
finest dramatic authors. The most of us are beasts—and,
for the Kirkwall hostage yonder, he uses
me, egad, as I use Fletcher, I think, and huffs me
the more, the more I do for him. But how delightful
it would be in a tropic night, when the ship was
hanging on the breeze, with a broad and steady sail,
for me to rehearse Alexander, with you for my pit,
box, and gallery! Nay, (for you are a follower of
the muses, as I remember,) who knows but you and
I might be the means of inspiring, like Orpheus and
Eurydice, a pure taste into our companions, and softening
their manners, while we excited their better
feelings?”</p>
<p>This was spoken with so much unction, that Claud
Halcro began to be afraid he had both made the
actual punch over potent, and mixed too many bewitching
ingredients in the cup of flattery which he
had administered; and that, under the influence of
both potions, the sentimental pirate might detain
him by force, merely to realize the scenes which his
imagination presented. The conjuncture was, however,
too delicate to admit of any active effort, on
Halcro’s part, to redeem his blunder, and therefore
he only returned the tender pressure of his friend’s
hand, and uttered the interjection “alas!” in as
pathetic a tone as he could.</p>
<p>Bunce immediately resumed: “You are right, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
friend, these are but vain visions of felicity, and it
remains but for the unhappy Altamont to serve the
friend to whom he is now to bid farewell. I have
determined to put you and the two girls ashore,
with Fletcher for your protection; and so call
up the young women, and let them begone before
the devil get aboard of me, or of some one
else. You will carry my letter to the magistrates,
and second it with your own eloquence, and assure
them, that if they hurt but one hair of Cleveland’s
head, there will be the devil to pay, and no
pitch hot.”</p>
<p>Relieved at heart by this unexpected termination
of Bunce’s harangue, Halcro descended the companion
ladder two steps at a time, and knocking at
the cabin door, could scarce find intelligible language
enough to say his errand. The sisters hearing,
with unexpected joy, that they were to be set
ashore, muffled themselves in their cloaks, and,
when they learned that the boat was hoisted out,
came hastily on deck, where they were apprized, for
the first time, to their great horror, that their father
was still to remain on board of the pirate.</p>
<p>“We will remain with him at every risk,” said
Minna—“we may be of some assistance to him,
were it but for an instant—we will live and die
with him!”</p>
<p>“We shall aid him more surely,” said Brenda,
who comprehended the nature of their situation
better than Minna, “by interesting the people of
Kirkwall to grant these gentlemen’s demands.”</p>
<p>“Spoken like an angel of sense and beauty,” said
Bunce; “and now away with you; for, d—n me,
if this is not like having a lighted linstock in the
powder-room—if you speak another word more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
confound me if I know how I shall bring myself
to part with you!”</p>
<p>“Go, in God’s name, my daughters,” said Magnus.
“I am in God’s hand; and when you are gone I shall
care little for myself—and I shall think and say, as
long as I live, that this good gentleman deserves a
better trade.—Go—go—away with you!”—for
they yet lingered in reluctance to leave him.</p>
<p>“Stay not to kiss,” said Bunce, “for fear I be
tempted to ask my share. Into the boat with you—yet
stop an instant.” He drew the three captives
apart—“Fletcher,” said he, “will answer for the
rest of the fellows, and will see you safe off the sea-beach.
But how to answer for Fletcher, I know
not, except by trusting Mr. Halcro with this little
guarantee.”</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">
<img alt="" src="images/i_635.jpg" title="" id="img_images_i_635.jpg" style="width: 100%; ">
</div>
<p>He offered the minstrel a small double-barrelled
pistol, which, he said, was loaded with a brace of
balls. Minna observed Halcro’s hand tremble as
he stretched it out to take the weapon. “Give it to
me, sir,” she said, taking it from the outlaw; “and
trust to me for defending my sister and myself.”</p>
<p>“Bravo, bravo!” shouted Bunce. “There spoke a
wench worthy of Cleveland, the King of Rovers!”</p>
<p>“Cleveland!” repeated Minna, “do you then know
that Cleveland, whom you have twice named?”</p>
<p>“Know him! Is there a man alive,” said Bunce,
“that knows better than I do the best and stoutest
fellow ever stepped betwixt stem and stern? When
he is out of the bilboes, as please Heaven he shall
soon be, I reckon to see you come on board of us,
and reign the queen of every sea we sail over.—You
have got the little guardian; I suppose you
know how to use it? If Fletcher behaves ill to you,
you need only draw up this piece of iron with your
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>thumb, so—and if he persists, it is but crooking
your pretty forefinger thus, and I shall lose the
most dutiful messmate that ever man had—though,
d—n the dog, he will deserve his death if he disobeys
my orders. And now, into the boat—but
stay, one kiss for Cleveland’s sake.”</p>
<p>Brenda, in deadly terror, endured his courtesy,
but Minna, stepping back with disdain, offered her
hand. Bunce laughed, but kissed, with a theatrical
air, the fair hand which she extended as a ransom
for her lips, and at length the sisters and Halcro
were placed in the boat, which rowed off under
Fletcher’s command.</p>
<p>Bunce stood on the quarter-deck, soliloquizing
after the manner of his original profession. “Were
this told at Port-Royal now, or at the isle of Providence,
or in the Petits Guaves, I wonder what they
would say of me! Why, that I was a good-natured
milksop—a Jack-a-lent—an ass.—Well,
let them. I have done enough of bad to think
about it; it is worth while doing one good action,
if it were but for the rarity of the thing, and to
put one in good humour with oneself.” Then turning
to Magnus Troil, he proceeded—“By —— these
are bona-robas, these daughters of yours! The
eldest would make her fortune on the London
boards. What a dashing attitude the wench had
with her, as she seized the pistol!—d—n me, that
touch would have brought the house down! What
a Roxalana the jade would have made!” (for, in
his oratory, Bunce, like Sancho’s gossip, Thomas
Cecial, was apt to use the most energetic word
which came to hand, without accurately considering
its propriety.) “I would give my share of the
next prize but to hear her spout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘Away, begone, and give a whirlwind room,<br>
Or I will blow you up like dust.—Avaunt!<br>
Madness but meanly represents my rage.’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">And then, again, that little, soft, shy, tearful trembler,
for Statira, to hear her recite—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘He speaks the kindest words, and looks such things,<br>
Vows with such passion, swears with so much grace,<br>
That ’tis a kind of heaven to be deluded by him.’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">What a play we might have run up!—I was a
beast not to think of it before I sent them off—I
to be Alexander—Claud Halcro, Lysimachus—this
old gentleman might have made a Clytus, for
a pinch. I was an idiot not to think of it!”</p>
<p>There was much in this effusion which might
have displeased the Udaller; but, to speak truth,
he paid no attention to it. His eye, and, finally,
his spy-glass, were employed in watching the return
of his daughters to the shore. He saw them
land on the beach, and, accompanied by Halcro, and
another man, (Fletcher, doubtless,) he saw them
ascend the acclivity, and proceed upon the road to
Kirkwall; and he could even distinguish that
Minna, as if considering herself as the guardian
of the party, walked a little aloof from the rest,
on the watch, as it seemed, against surprise, and
ready to act as occasion should require. At length,
as the Udaller was just about to lose sight of them,
he had the exquisite satisfaction to see the party
halt, and the pirate leave them, after a space just
long enough for a civil farewell, and proceed slowly
back, on his return to the beach. Blessing the
Great Being who had thus relieved him from the
most agonizing fears which a father can feel,
the worthy Udaller, from that instant, stood resigned
to his own fate, whatever that might be.</p>

</p>
<p>The parting of Fletcher from Claud Halcro and the
sisters of Burgh-Westra, on the spot where it took
place, was partly occasioned by a small party of
armed men being seen at a distance in the act of
advancing from Kirkwall, an apparition hidden
from the Udaller’s spy-glass by the swell of the
ground, but quite visible to the pirate, whom it
determined to consult his own safety by a speedy
return to his boat. He was just turning away,
when Minna occasioned the short delay which her
father had observed.</p>
<p>“Stop,” she said; “I command you!—Tell your
leader from me, that whatever the answer may
be from Kirkwall, he shall carry his vessel, nevertheless,
round to Stromness; and, being anchored
there, let him send a boat ashore for Captain Cleveland
when he shall see a smoke on the Bridge of
Broisgar.”</p>
<p>Fletcher had thought, like his messmate Bunce
of asking a kiss, at least, for the trouble of escorting
these beautiful young women; and perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
neither the terror of the approaching Kirkwall men,
nor of Minna’s weapon, might have prevented his
being insolent. But the name of his Captain, and,
still more, the unappalled, dignified, and commanding
manner of Minna Troil, overawed him. He
made a sea bow,—promised to keep a sharp look-out,
and, returning to his boat, went on board with
his message.</p>
<p>As Halcro and the sisters advanced towards the
party whom they saw on the Kirkwall road, and
who, on their part, had halted as if to observe them,
Brenda, relieved from the fears of Fletcher’s presence,
which had hitherto kept her silent, exclaimed,
“Merciful Heaven!—Minna, in what hands have
we left our dear father?”</p>
<p>“In the hands of brave men,” said Minna, steadily—“I
fear not for him.”</p>
<p>“As brave as you please,” said Claud Halcro,
“but very dangerous rogues for all that.—I know
that fellow Altamont, as he calls himself, though
that is not his right name neither, as deboshed a
dog as ever made a barn ring with blood and blank
verse. He began with Barnwell, and every body
thought he would end with the gallows, like the
last scene in Venice Preserved.”</p>
<p>“It matters not,” said Minna—“the wilder the
waves, the more powerful is the voice that rules
them. The name alone of Cleveland ruled the
mood of the fiercest amongst them.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry for Cleveland,” said Brenda, “if
such are his companions,—but I care little for him
in comparison to my father.”</p>
<p>“Reserve your compassion for those who need
it,” said Minna, “and fear nothing for our father.—God
knows, every silver hair on his head is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
me worth the treasure of an unsummed mine; but
I know that he is safe while in yonder vessel, and
I know that he will be soon safe on shore.”</p>
<p>“I would I could see it,” said Claud Halcro;
“but I fear the Kirkwall people, supposing Cleveland
to be such as I dread, will not dare to exchange
him against the Udaller. The Scots have very
severe laws against theft-boot, as they call it.”</p>
<p>“But who are those on the road before us?”
said Brenda; “and why do they halt there so
jealously?”</p>
<p>“They are a patrol of the militia,” answered
Halcro. “Glorious John touches them off a little
sharply,—but then John was a Jacobite,—<a id="FNanchor2_E_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_E_43">(<i>e</i>)</a></p>
<p class="poem">
‘Mouths without hands, maintain’d at vast expense,<br>
In peace a charge, in war a weak defence;<br>
Stout once a-month, they march, a blustering band,<br>
And ever, but in time of need, at hand.’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">I fancy they halted just now, taking us, as they
saw us on the brow of the hill, for a party of the
sloop’s men, and now they can distinguish that you
wear petticoats, they are moving on again.”</p>
<p>They came on accordingly, and proved to be, as
Claud Halcro had suggested, a patrol sent out to
watch the motions of the pirates, and to prevent
their attempting descents to damage the country.</p>
<p>They heartily congratulated Claud Halcro, who
was well known to more than one of them, upon
his escape from captivity; and the commander of
the party, while offering every assistance to the
ladies, could not help condoling with them on the
circumstances in which their father stood, hinting,
though in a delicate and doubtful manner, the difficulties
which might be in the way of his liberation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>When they arrived at Kirkwall, and obtained an
audience of the Provost, and one or two of the
Magistrates, these difficulties were more plainly
insisted upon.—“The Halcyon frigate is upon the
coast,” said the Provost; “she was seen off Duncansbay-head;
and, though I have the deepest respect
for Mr. Troil of Burgh-Westra, yet I shall
be answerable to law if I release from prison the
Captain of this suspicious vessel, on account of the
safety of any individual who may be unhappily endangered
by his detention. This man is now known
to be the heart and soul of these buccaniers, and
am I at liberty to send him aboard, that he may
plunder the country, or perhaps go fight the King’s
ship?—for he has impudence enough for any
thing.”</p>
<p>“<i>Courage</i> enough for any thing, you mean, Mr.
Provost,” said Minna, unable to restrain her
displeasure.</p>
<p>“Why, you may call it as you please, Miss
Troil,” said the worthy Magistrate; “but, in my
opinion, that sort of courage which proposes to
fight singly against two, is little better than a kind
of practical impudence.”</p>
<p>“But our father?” said Brenda, in a tone of the
most earnest entreaty—“our father—the friend,
I may say the father, of his country—to whom so
many look for kindness, and so many for actual
support—whose loss would be the extinction of a
beacon in a storm—will you indeed weigh the risk
which he runs, against such a trifling thing as letting
an unfortunate man from prison, to seek his
unhappy fate elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“Miss Brenda is right,” said Claud Halcro; “I
am for let-a-be for let-a-be, as the boys say; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
never fash about a warrant of liberation, Provost,
but just take a fool’s counsel, and let the goodman
of the jail forget to draw his bolt on the wicket, or
leave a chink of a window open, or the like, and
we shall be rid of the rover, and have the one best
honest fellow in Orkney or Zetland on the lee-side
of a bowl of punch with us in five hours.”</p>
<p>The Provost replied in nearly the same terms
as before, that he had the highest respect for Mr.
Magnus Troil of Burgh-Westra, but that he could
not suffer his consideration for any individual, however
respectable, to interfere with the discharge of
his duty.</p>
<p>Minna then addressed her sister in a tone of calm
and sarcastic displeasure.—“You forget,” she said,
“Brenda, that you are talking of the safety of a
poor insignificant Udaller of Zetland, to no less a
person than the Chief Magistrate of the metropolis
of Orkney—can you expect so great a person to
condescend to such a trifling subject of consideration?
It will be time enough for the Provost to
think of complying with the terms sent to him—for
comply with them at length he both must and
will—when the Church of Saint Magnus is beat
down about his ears.”</p>
<p>“You may be angry with me, my pretty young
lady,” said the good-humoured Provost Torfe, “but
I cannot be offended with you. The Church of Saint
Magnus has stood many a day, and, I think, will
outlive both you and me, much more yonder pack
of unhanged dogs. And besides that your father is
half an Orkneyman, and has both estate and friends
among us, I would, I give you my word, do as much
for a Zetlander in distress as I would for any one,
excepting one of our own native Kirkwallers, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
are doubtless to be preferred. And if you will take
up your lodgings here with my wife and myself, we
will endeavour to show you,” continued he, “that
you are as welcome in Kirkwall, as ever you could
be in Lerwick or Scalloway.”</p>
<p>Minna deigned no reply to this good-humoured
invitation, but Brenda declined it in civil terms,
pleading the necessity of taking up their abode with
a wealthy widow of Kirkwall, a relation, who
already expected them.</p>
<p>Halcro made another attempt to move the Provost,
but found him inexorable.—“The Collector of
the Customs had already threatened,” he said, “to
inform against him for entering into treaty, or, as he
called it, packing and peeling with those strangers,
even when it seemed the only means of preventing
a bloody affray in the town; and, should he now
forego the advantage afforded by the imprisonment
of Cleveland and the escape of the Factor, he
might incur something worse than censure.” The
burden of the whole was, “that he was sorry for the
Udaller, he was sorry even for the lad Cleveland,
who had some sparks of honour about him; but his
duty was imperious, and must be obeyed.” The
Provost then precluded farther argument, by observing,
that another affair from Zetland called for
his immediate attention. A gentleman named
Mertoun, residing at Jarlshof, had made complaint
against Snailsfoot the Jagger, for having assisted
a domestic of his in embezzling some valuable
articles which had been deposited in his custody,
and he was about to take examinations on the subject,
and cause them to be restored to Mr. Mertoun,
who was accountable for them to the right owner.</p>
<p>In all this information, there was nothing which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
seemed interesting to the sisters excepting the word
Mertoun, which went like a dagger to the heart
of Minna, when she recollected the circumstances
under which Mordaunt Mertoun had disappeared,
and which, with an emotion less painful, though
still of a melancholy nature, called a faint blush
into Brenda’s cheek, and a slight degree of moisture
into her eye. But it was soon evident that
the Magistrate spoke not of Mordaunt, but of his
father; and the daughters of Magnus, little interested
in his detail, took leave of the Provost to
go to their own lodgings.</p>
<p>When they arrived at their relation’s, Minna
made it her business to learn, by such enquiries as
she could make without exciting suspicion, what
was the situation of the unfortunate Cleveland,
which she soon discovered to be exceedingly precarious.
The Provost had not, indeed, committed
him to close custody, as Claud Halcro had anticipated,
recollecting, perhaps, the favourable circumstances
under which he had surrendered himself,
and loath, till the moment of the last necessity,
altogether to break faith with him. But although
left apparently at large, he was strictly watched by
persons well armed and appointed for the purpose,
who had directions to detain him by force, if he
attempted to pass certain narrow precincts which
were allotted to him. He was quartered in a strong
room within what is called the King’s Castle, and
at night his chamber door was locked on the outside,
and a sufficient guard mounted to prevent his
escape. He therefore enjoyed only the degree of
liberty which the cat, in her cruel sport, is sometimes
pleased to permit to the mouse which she
has clutched; and yet, such was the terror of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
resources, the courage, and ferocity of the pirate Captain,
that the Provost was blamed by the Collector,
and many other sage citizens of Kirkwall, for permitting
him to be at large upon any conditions.</p>
<p>It may be well believed, that, under such circumstances,
Cleveland had no desire to seek any place
of public resort, conscious that he was the object of
a mixed feeling of curiosity and terror. His favourite
place of exercise, therefore, was the external
aisles of the Cathedral of Saint Magnus, of which
the eastern end alone is fitted up for public worship.
This solemn old edifice, having escaped the ravage
which attended the first convulsions of the Reformation,
still retains some appearance of episcopal
dignity. This place of worship is separated by a
screen from the nave and western limb of the cross,
and the whole is preserved in a state of cleanliness and
decency, which might be well proposed as an example
to the proud piles of Westminster and St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>It was in this exterior part of the Cathedral that
Cleveland was permitted to walk, the rather that
his guards, by watching the single open entrance,
had the means, with very little inconvenience to
themselves, of preventing any possible attempt at
escape. The place itself was well suited to his melancholy
circumstances. The lofty and vaulted roof
rises upon ranges of Saxon pillars, of massive size,
four of which, still larger than the rest, once supported
the lofty spire, which, long since destroyed
by accident, has been rebuilt upon a disproportioned
and truncated plan. The light is admitted at the
eastern end through a lofty, well-proportioned, and
richly-ornamented Gothic window; and the pavement
is covered with inscriptions, in different languages,
distinguishing the graves of noble Orcadians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
who have at different times been deposited within
the sacred precincts.</p>
<p>Here walked Cleveland, musing over the events
of a misspent life, which, it seemed probable, might
be brought to a violent and shameful close, while
he was yet in the prime of youth.—“With these
dead,” he said, looking on the pavement, “shall I
soon be numbered—but no holy man will speak a
blessing; no friendly hand register an inscription;
no proud descendant sculpture armorial bearings
over the grave of the pirate Cleveland. My whitening
bones will swing in the gibbet-irons, on some
wild beach or lonely cape, that will be esteemed
fatal and accursed for my sake. The old mariner,
as he passes the Sound, will shake his head, and
tell of my name and actions, as a warning to his
younger comrades.—But, Minna! Minna!—what
will be thy thoughts when the news reaches thee?—Would
to God the tidings were drowned in the
deepest whirlpool betwixt Kirkwall and Burgh-Westra,
ere they came to her ear!—and O! would
to Heaven that we had never met, since we never
can meet again!”</p>
<p>He lifted up his eyes as he spoke, and Minna
Troil stood before him. Her face was pale, and
her hair dishevelled; but her look was composed
and firm, with its usual expression of high-minded
melancholy. She was still shrouded in the large
mantle which she had assumed on leaving the vessel.
Cleveland’s first emotion was astonishment;
his next was joy, not unmixed with awe. He would
have exclaimed—he would have thrown himself at
her feet—but she imposed at once silence and composure
on him, by raising her finger, and saying, in
a low but commanding accent,—“Be cautious—we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
are observed—there are men without—they let me
enter with difficulty. I dare not remain long—they
would think—they might believe—O, Cleveland!
I have hazarded every thing to save you!”</p>
<p>“To save me?—Alas! poor Minna!” answered
Cleveland, “to save me is impossible.—Enough
that I have seen you once more, were it but to say,
for ever farewell!”</p>
<p>“We must indeed say farewell,” said Minna;
“for fate, and your guilt, have divided us for ever.—Cleveland,
I have seen your associates—need I
tell you more—need I say, that I know now what
a pirate is?”</p>
<p>“You have been in the ruffians’ power!” said
Cleveland, with a start of agony—“Did they
presume”——</p>
<p>“Cleveland,” replied Minna, “they presumed
nothing—your name was a spell over them. By
the power of that spell over these ferocious banditti,
and by that alone, I was reminded of the qualities I
once thought my Cleveland’s!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Cleveland, proudly, “my name has
and shall have power over them, when they are at
the wildest; and, had they harmed you by one rude
word, they should have found—Yet what do I rave
about—I am a prisoner!”</p>
<p>“You shall be so no longer,” said Minna—“Your
safety—the safety of my dear father—all demand
your instant freedom. I have formed a scheme for
your liberty, which, boldly executed, cannot fail.
The light is fading without—muffle yourself in my
cloak, and you will easily pass the guards—I have
given them the means of carousing, and they are
deeply engaged. Haste to the Loch of Stennis, and
hide yourself till day dawns; then make a smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
on the point, where the land, stretching into the
lake on each side, divides it nearly in two at the
Bridge of Broisgar. Your vessel, which lies not
far distant, will send a boat ashore.—Do not hesitate
an instant!”</p>
<p>“But you, Minna!—Should this wild scheme succeed,”
said Cleveland, “what is to become of you?”</p>
<p>“For my share in your escape,” answered the
maiden, “the honesty of my own intention will vindicate
me in the sight of Heaven; and the safety of
my father, whose fate depends on yours, will be my
excuse to man.”</p>
<p>In a few words, she gave him the history of their
capture, and its consequences. Cleveland cast up
his eyes and raised his hands to Heaven, in thankfulness
for the escape of the sisters from his evil
companions, and then hastily added,—“But you
are right, Minna; I must fly at all rates—for your
father’s sake I must fly.—Here, then, we part—yet
not, I trust, for ever.”</p>
<p>“For ever!” answered a voice, that sounded as
from a sepulchral vault.</p>
<p>They started, looked around them, and then
gazed on each other. It seemed as if the echoes of
the building had returned Cleveland’s last words, but
the pronunciation was too emphatically accented.</p>
<p>“Yes, for ever!” said Norna of the Fitful-head,
stepping forward from behind one of the massive
Saxon pillars which support the roof of the Cathedral.
“Here meet the crimson foot and the crimson
hand. Well for both that the wound is healed
whence that crimson was derived—well for both,
but best, for him who shed it.—Here, then, you
meet—and meet for the last time!”</p>
<p>“Not so,” said Cleveland, as if about to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Minna’s hand; “to separate me from Minna, while
I have life, must be the work of herself alone.”</p>
<p>“Away!” said Norna, stepping betwixt them,—“away
with such idle folly!—Nourish no vain
dreams of future meetings—you part here, and you
part for ever. The hawk pairs not with the dove;
guilt matches not with innocence.—Minna Troil,
you look for the last time on this bold and criminal
man—Cleveland, you behold Minna for the
last time!”</p>
<p>“And dream you,” said Cleveland, indignantly,
“that your mummery imposes on me, and that I
am among the fools who see more than trick in your
pretended art?”</p>
<p>“Forbear, Cleveland, forbear!” said Minna, her
hereditary awe of Norna augmented by the circumstance
of her sudden appearance. “O, forbear!—she
is powerful—she is but too powerful.—And
do you, O Norna, remember my father’s safety is
linked with Cleveland’s.”</p>
<p>“And it is well for Cleveland that I do remember
it,” replied the Pythoness—“and that, for the
sake of one, I am here to aid both. You, with your
childish purpose, of passing one of his bulk and
stature under the disguise of a few paltry folds of
wadmaal—what would your device have procured
him but instant restraint with bolt and shackle?—I
will save him—I will place him in security on
board his bark. But let him renounce these shores
for ever, and carry elsewhere the terrors of his sable
flag, and his yet blacker name; for if the sun rises
twice, and finds him still at anchor, his blood be on
his own head.—Ay, look to each other—look the
last look that I permit to frail affection,—and say,
if ye <i>can</i> say it, Farewell for ever!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Obey her,” stammered Minna; “remonstrate not,
but obey her.”</p>
<p>Cleveland, grasping her hand, and kissing it ardently,
said, but so low that she only could hear it,
“Farewell, Minna, but <i>not</i> for ever.”</p>
<p>“And now, maiden, begone,” said Norna, “and
leave the rest to the Reimkennar.”</p>
<p>“One word more,” said Minna, “and I obey you.
Tell me but if I have caught aright your meaning—Is
Mordaunt Mertoun safe and recovered?”</p>
<p>“Recovered, and safe,” said Norna; “else woe to
the hand that shed his blood!”</p>
<p>Minna slowly sought the door of the Cathedral,
and turned back from time to time to look at the
shadowy form of Norna, and the stately and military
figure of Cleveland, as they stood together in the
deepening gloom of the ancient Cathedral. When
she looked back a second time they were in motion,
and Cleveland followed the matron, as, with
a slow and solemn step, she glided towards one of
the side aisles. When Minna looked back a third
time, their figures were no longer visible. She
collected herself, and walked on to the eastern
door by which she had entered, and listened for
an instant to the guard, who talked together on
the outside.</p>
<p>“The Zetland girl stays a long time with this
pirate fellow,” said one. “I wish they have not
more to speak about than the ransom of her father.”</p>
<p>“Ay, truly,” answered another, “the wenches
will have more sympathy with a handsome young
pirate, than an old bed-ridden burgher.”</p>
<p>Their discourse was here interrupted by her of
whom they were speaking; and, as if taken in
the manner, they pulled off their hats, made their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
awkward obeisances, and looked not a little embarrassed
and confused.</p>
<p>Minna returned to the house where she lodged,
much affected, yet, on the whole, pleased with the
result of her expedition, which seemed to put her
father out of danger, and assured her at once of the
escape of Cleveland, and of the safety of young Mordaunt.
She hastened to communicate both pieces of
intelligence to Brenda, who joined her in thankfulness
to Heaven, and was herself wellnigh persuaded
to believe in Norna’s supernatural pretensions, so
much was she pleased with the manner in which
they had been employed. Some time was spent in
exchanging their mutual congratulations, and mingling
tears of hope, mixed with apprehension;
when, at a late hour in the evening, they were interrupted
by Claud Halcro, who, full of a fidgeting
sort of importance, not unmingled with fear, came
to acquaint them, that the prisoner, Cleveland, had
disappeared from the Cathedral, in which he had
been permitted to walk, and that the Provost, having
been informed that Minna was accessary to his
flight, was coming, in a mighty quandary, to make
enquiry into the circumstances.</p>
<p>When the worthy Magistrate arrived, Minna did
not conceal from him her own wish that Cleveland
should make his escape, as the only means which
she saw of redeeming her father from imminent
danger. But that she had any actual accession to
his flight, she positively denied; and stated, “that
she had parted from Cleveland in the Cathedral,
more than two hours since, and then left him in
company with a third person, whose name she did
not conceive herself obliged to communicate.”</p>
<p>“It is not needful, Miss Minna Troil,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Provost Torfe; “for, although no person but this
Captain Cleveland and yourself was seen to enter the
Kirk of St. Magnus this day, we know well enough
that your cousin, old Ulla Troil, whom you Zetlanders
call Norna of Fitful-head, has been cruising
up and down, upon sea and land, and air, for what
I know, in boats and on ponies, and it may be on
broomsticks; and here has been her dumb Drow,
too, coming and going, and playing the spy on every
one—and a good spy he is, for he can hear every
thing, and tells nothing again, unless to his mistress.
And we know, besides, that she can enter the Kirk
when all the doors are fast, and has been seen there
more than once, God save us from the Evil One!—and
so, without farther questions asked, I conclude
it was old Norna whom you left in the Kirk
with this slashing blade—and, if so, they may catch
them again that can.—I cannot but say, however,
pretty Mistress Minna, that you Zetland folks seem
to forget both law and gospel, when you use the
help of witchcraft to fetch delinquents out of a legal
prison; and the least that you, or your cousin, or
your father, can do, is to use influence with this
wild fellow to go away as soon as possible, without
hurting the town or trade, and then there will be
little harm in what has chanced; for, Heaven knows,
I did not seek the poor lad’s life, so I could get
my hands free of him without blame; and far less
did I wish, that, through his imprisonment, any
harm should come to worthy Magnus Troil of
Burgh-Westra.”</p>
<p>“I see where the shoe pinches you, Mr. Provost,”
said Claud Halcro, “and I am sure I can answer
for my friend Mr. Troil, as well as for myself, that
we will say and do all in our power with this man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Captain Cleveland, to make him leave the coast
directly.”</p>
<p>“And I,” said Minna, “am so convinced that what
you recommend is best for all parties, that my sister
and I will set off early to-morrow morning to
the House of Stennis, if Mr. Halcro will give us
his escort, to receive my father when he comes
ashore, that we may acquaint him with your wish,
and to use every influence to induce this unhappy
man to leave the country.”</p>
<p>Provost Torfe looked upon her with some surprise.
“It is not every young woman,” he said,
“would wish to move eight miles nearer to a band
of pirates.”</p>
<p>“We run no risk,” said Claud Halcro, interfering.
“The House of Stennis is strong; and my cousin,
whom it belongs to, has men and arms within it.
The young ladies are as safe there as in Kirkwall;
and much good may arise from an early communication
between Magnus Troil and his daughters.
And happy am I to see, that in your case, my good
old friend,—as glorious John says,—</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">——‘After much debate,</span><br>
The man prevails above the magistrate.’”<br>
</p>
<p>The Provost smiled, nodded his head, and indicated,
as far as he thought he could do so with
decency, how happy he should be if the Fortune’s
Favourite, and her disorderly crew, would leave
Orkney without further interference, or violence
on either side. He could not authorize their being
supplied from the shore, he said; but, either for
fear or favour, they were certain to get provisions
at Stromness. This pacific magistrate then took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
leave of Halcro and the two ladies, who proposed
the next morning, to transfer their residence to the
House of Stennis, situated upon the banks of the
salt-water lake of the same name, and about four
miles by water from the Road of Stromness, where
the Rover’s vessel was lying.</p>

</p>
<p>It was one branch of the various arts by which
Norna endeavoured to maintain her pretensions to
supernatural powers, that she made herself familiarly
and practically acquainted with all the secret
passes and recesses, whether natural or artificial,
which she could hear of, whether by tradition or
otherwise, and was, by such knowledge, often enabled
to perform feats which were otherwise unaccountable.
Thus, when she escaped from the
tabernacle at Burgh-Westra, it was by a sliding
board which covered a secret passage in the wall,
known to none but herself and Magnus, who, she
was well assured, would not betray her. The profusion,
also, with which she lavished a considerable
income, otherwise of no use to her, enabled her to
procure the earliest intelligence respecting whatever
she desired to know, and, at the same time, to secure
all other assistance necessary to carry her plans into
effect. Cleveland, upon the present occasion, had
reason to admire both her sagacity and her resources.</p>
<p>Upon her applying a little forcible pressure, a
door which was concealed under some rich wooden
sculpture in the screen which divides the eastern
aisle from the rest of the Cathedral, opened, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
disclosed a dark narrow winding passage, into which
she entered, telling Cleveland, in a whisper, to follow,
and be sure he shut the door behind him. He
obeyed, and followed her in darkness and silence,
sometimes descending steps, of the number of which
she always apprized him, sometimes ascending, and
often turning at short angles. The air was more
free than he could have expected, the passage being
ventilated at different parts by unseen and ingeniously
contrived spiracles, which communicated with
the open air. At length their long course ended,
by Norna drawing aside a sliding panel, which,
opening behind a wooden, or box-bed, as it is called
in Scotland, admitted them into an ancient, but very
mean apartment, having a latticed window, and a
groined roof. The furniture was much dilapidated;
and its only ornaments were, on the one side of the
wall, a garland of faded ribbons, such as are used
to decorate whale-vessels; and, on the other, an
escutcheon, bearing an Earl’s arms and coronet, surrounded
with the usual emblems of mortality. The
mattock and spade, which lay in one corner, together
with the appearance of an old man, who, in a rusty
black coat, and slouched hat, sat reading by a table,
announced that they were in the habitation of the
church-beadle, or sexton, and in the presence of
that respectable functionary.</p>
<p>When his attention was attracted by the noise
of the sliding panel, he arose, and, testifying much
respect, but no surprise, took his shadowy hat from
his thin grey locks, and stood uncovered in the presence
of Norna with an air of profound humility.</p>
<p>“Be faithful,” said Norna to the old man, “and
beware you show not any living mortal the secret
path to the Sanctuary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>”</p>
<p>The old man bowed, in token of obedience and
of thanks, for she put money in his hand as she
spoke. With a faltering voice, he expressed his
hope that she would remember his son, who was on
the Greenland voyage, that he might return fortunate
and safe, as he had done last year, when he
brought back the garland, pointing to that upon
the wall.</p>
<p>“My cauldron shall boil, and my rhyme shall be
said, in his behalf,” answered Norna. “Waits Pacolet
without with the horses?”</p>
<p>The old Sexton assented, and the Pythoness,
commanding Cleveland to follow her, went through
a back door of the apartment into a small garden,
corresponding, in its desolate appearance, to the
habitation they had just quitted. The low and
broken wall easily permitted them to pass into
another and larger garden, though not much better
kept, and a gate, which was upon the latch, let them
into a long and winding lane, through which, Norna
having whispered to her companion that it was the
only dangerous place on their road, they walked
with a hasty pace. It was now nearly dark, and
the inhabitants of the poor dwellings, on either hand,
had betaken themselves to their houses. They saw
only one woman, who was looking from her door,
but blessed herself, and retired into her house with
precipitation, when she saw the tall figure of Norna
stalk past her with long strides. The lane conducted
them into the country, where the dumb dwarf waited
with three horses, ensconced behind the wall of a
deserted shed. On one of these Norna instantly
seated herself, Cleveland mounted another, and, followed
by Pacolet on the third, they moved sharply
on through the darkness; the active and spirited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
animals on which they rode being of a breed rather
taller than those reared in Zetland.</p>
<p>After more than an hour’s smart riding, in which
Norna acted as guide, they stopped before a hovel,
so utterly desolate in appearance, that it resembled
rather a cattle-shed than a cottage.</p>
<p>“Here you must remain till dawn, when your
signal can be seen from your vessel,” said Norna,
consigning the horses to the care of Pacolet, and
leading the way into the wretched hovel, which she
presently illuminated by lighting the small iron lamp
which she usually carried along with her. “It is
a poor,” she said, “but a safe place of refuge; for
were we pursued hither, the earth would yawn and
admit us into its recesses ere you were taken. For
know, that this ground is sacred to the Gods of old
Valhalla.—And now say, man of mischief and of
blood, are you friend or foe to Norna, the sole
priestess of these disowned deities?”</p>
<p>“How is it possible for me to be your enemy?”
said Cleveland.—“Common gratitude”——</p>
<p>“Common gratitude,” said Norna, interrupting him,
“is a common word—and words are the common
pay which fools accept at the hands of knaves; but
Norna must be requited by actions—by sacrifices.”</p>
<p>“Well, mother, name your request.”</p>
<p>“That you never seek to see Minna Troil again,
and that you leave this coast in twenty-four hours,”
answered Norna.</p>
<p>“It is impossible,” said the outlaw; “I cannot be
soon enough found in the sea-stores which the sloop
must have.”</p>
<p>“You can. I will take care you are fully supplied;
and Caithness and the Hebrides are not far
distant—you can depart if you will.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“And why should I,” said Cleveland, “if I will
not?”</p>
<p>“Because your stay endangers others,” said Norna,
“and will prove your own destruction. Hear me
with attention. From the first moment I saw you
lying senseless on the sand beneath the cliffs of
Sumburgh, I read that in your countenance which
linked you with me, and those who were dear to
me; but whether for good or evil, was hidden from
mine eyes. I aided in saving your life, in preserving
your property. I aided in doing so, the very youth
whom you have crossed in his dearest affections—crossed
by tale-bearing and slander.”</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> slander Mertoun!” exclaimed Cleveland. “By
heaven, I scarce mentioned his name at Burgh-Westra,
if it is that which you mean. The peddling
fellow Bryce, meaning, I believe, to be my friend,
because he found something could be made by me,
did, I have since heard, carry tattle, or truth, I
know not which, to the old man, which was confirmed
by the report of the whole island. But, for
me, I scarce thought of him as a rival; else, I had
taken a more honourable way to rid myself of him.”</p>
<p>“Was the point of your double-edged knife, directed
to the bosom of an unarmed man, intended
to carve out that more honourable way?” said
Norna, sternly.</p>
<p>Cleveland was conscience-struck, and remained
silent for an instant, ere he replied, “There, indeed,
I was wrong; but he is, I thank Heaven, recovered,
and welcome to an honourable satisfaction.”</p>
<p>“Cleveland,” said the Pythoness, “No! The fiend
who employs you as his implement is powerful;
but with me he shall not strive. You are of that
temperament which the dark Influences desire as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the tools of their agency; bold, haughty, and undaunted,
unrestrained by principle, and having only
in its room a wild sense of indomitable pride, which
such men call honour. Such you are, and as such
your course through life has been—onward and
unrestrained, bloody and tempestuous. By me, however,
it shall be controlled,” she concluded, stretching
out her staff, as if in the attitude of determined
authority—“ay, even although the demon who presides
over it should now arise in his terrors.”</p>
<p>Cleveland laughed scornfully. “Good mother,”
he said, “reserve such language for the rude sailor
that implores you to bestow him fair wind, or the
poor fisherman that asks success to his nets and
lines. I have been long inaccessible both to fear
and to superstition. Call forth your demon, if you
command one, and place him before me. The man
that has spent years in company with incarnate
devils, can scarce dread the presence of a disembodied
fiend.”</p>
<p>This was said with a careless and desperate bitterness
of spirit, which proved too powerfully energetic
even for the delusions of Norna’s insanity; and it
was with a hollow and tremulous voice that she
asked Cleveland—“For what, then, do you hold me,
if you deny the power I have bought so dearly?”</p>
<p>“You have wisdom, mother,” said Cleveland; “at
least you have art, and art is power. I hold you for
one who knows how to steer upon the current of
events, but I deny your power to change its course.
Do not, therefore, waste words in quoting terrors
for which I have no feeling, but tell me at once,
wherefore you would have me depart?”</p>
<p>“Because I will have you see Minna no more,”
answered Norna—“Because Minna is the destined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
bride of him whom men call Mordaunt Mertoun—Because
if you depart not within twenty-four hours,
utter destruction awaits you. In these plain words
there is no metaphysical delusion—Answer me as
plainly.”</p>
<p>“In as plain words, then,” answered Cleveland,
“I will <i>not</i> leave these islands—not, at least, till
I have seen Minna Troil; and never shall your
Mordaunt possess her while I live.”</p>
<p>“Hear him!” said Norna—“hear a mortal man
spurn at the means of prolonging his life!—hear a
sinful—a most sinful being, refuse the time which
fate yet affords for repentance, and for the salvation
of an immortal soul!—Behold him how he stands
erect, bold and confident in his youthful strength
and courage! My eyes, unused to tears—even my
eyes, which have so little cause to weep for him,
are blinded with sorrow, to think what so fair a
form will be ere the second sun set!”</p>
<p>“Mother,” said Cleveland, firmly, yet with some
touch of sorrow in his voice, “I in part understand
your threats. You know more than we do of the
course of the Halcyon—perhaps have the means
(for I acknowledge you have shown wonderful skill
of combination in such affairs) of directing her cruise
our way. Be it so,—I will not depart from my
purpose for that risk. If the frigate comes hither,
we have still our shoal water to trust to; and I
think they will scarce cut us out with boats, as if
we were a Spanish xebeck. I am therefore resolved
I will hoist once more the flag under which I have
cruised, avail ourselves of the thousand chances
which have helped us in greater odds, and, at the
worst, fight the vessel to the very last; and, when
mortal man can do no more, it is but snapping a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
pistol in the powder-room, and, as we have lived, so
will we die.”</p>
<p>There was a dead pause as Cleveland ended; and
it was broken by his resuming, in a softer tone—“You
have heard my answer, mother; let us debate
it no further, but part in peace. I would willingly
leave you a remembrance, that you may not forget
a poor fellow to whom your services have been useful,
and who parts with you in no unkindness, however
unfriendly you are to his dearest interests.—Nay,
do not shun to accept such a trifle,” he said, forcing
upon Norna the little silver enchased box which
had been once the subject of strife betwixt Mertoun
and him; “it is not for the sake of the metal,
which I know you value not, but simply as a
memorial that you have met him of whom many
a strange tale will hereafter be told in the seas
which he has traversed.”</p>
<p>“I accept your gift,” said Norna, “in token that,
if I have in aught been accessary to your fate, it
was as the involuntary and grieving agent of other
powers. Well did you say we direct not the current
of the events which hurry us forward, and
render our utmost efforts unavailing; even as the
wells of Tuftiloe<a id="FNanchor2_39_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_39_44">[39]</a> can wheel the stoutest vessel
round and round, in despite of either sail or steerage.—Pacolet!”
she exclaimed, in a louder voice,
“what, ho! Pacolet!”</p>
<p>A large stone, which lay at the side of the wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
of the hovel, fell as she spoke, and to Cleveland’s
surprise, if not somewhat to his fear, the misshapen
form of the dwarf was seen, like some overgrown
reptile, extricating himself out of a subterranean
passage, the entrance to which the stone had
covered.</p>
<p>Norna, as if impressed by what Cleveland had
said on the subject of her supernatural pretensions,
was so far from endeavouring to avail herself of
this opportunity to enforce them, that she hastened
to explain the phenomenon he had witnessed.</p>
<p>“Such passages,” she said, “to which the entrances
are carefully concealed, are frequently found
in these islands—the places of retreat of the ancient
inhabitants, where they sought refuge from the rage
of the Normans, the pirates of that day. It was
that you might avail yourself of this, in case of need,
that I brought you hither. Should you observe
signs of pursuit, you may either lurk in the bowels
of the earth until it has passed by, or escape, if you
will, through the farther entrance near the lake,
by which Pacolet entered but now.—And now
farewell! Think on what I have said; for as
sure as you now move and breathe a living man,
so surely is your doom fixed and sealed, unless,
within four-and-twenty hours, you have doubled
the Burgh-head.”</p>
<p>“Farewell, mother!” said Cleveland, as she departed,
bending a look upon him, in which, as he
could perceive by the lamp, sorrow was mingled
with displeasure.</p>
<p>The interview, which thus concluded, left a strong
effect even upon the mind of Cleveland, accustomed
as he was to imminent dangers and to hair-breadth
escapes. He in vain attempted to shake off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
impression left by the words of Norna, which he felt
the more powerful, because they were in a great
measure divested of her wonted mystical tone, which
he contemned. A thousand times he regretted that
he had from time to time delayed the resolution,
which he had long adopted, to quit his dreadful and
dangerous trade; and as often he firmly determined,
that, could he but see Minna Troil once more,
were it but for a last farewell, he would leave the
sloop, as soon as his comrades were extricated from
their perilous situation, endeavour to obtain the
benefit of the King’s pardon, and distinguish himself,
if possible, in some more honourable course
of warfare.</p>
<p>This resolution, to which he again and again
pledged himself, had at length a sedative effect on
his mental perturbation, and, wrapt in his cloak, he
enjoyed, for a time, that imperfect repose which exhausted
nature demands as her tribute, even from
those who are situated on the verge of the most
imminent danger. But how far soever the guilty
may satisfy his own mind, and stupify the feelings
of remorse, by such a conditional repentance, we
may well question whether it is not, in the sight of
Heaven, rather a presumptuous aggravation, than
an expiation of his sins.</p>
<p>When Cleveland awoke, the grey dawn was already
mingling with the twilight of an Orcadian
night. He found himself on the verge of a beautiful
sheet of water, which, close by the place where he
had rested, was nearly divided by two tongues of
land that approach each other from the opposing
sides of the lake, and are in some degree united by
the Bridge of Broisgar, a long causeway, containing
openings to permit the flow and reflux of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
tide. Behind him, and fronting to the bridge, stood
that remarkable semicircle of huge upright stones,
which has no rival in Britain, excepting the inimitable
monument at Stonehenge. These immense
blocks of stone, all of them above twelve feet, and
several being even fourteen or fifteen feet in height,
stood around the pirate in the grey light of the dawning,
like the phantom forms of antediluvian giants,
who, shrouded in the habiliments of the dead, came
to revisit, by this pale light, the earth which they
had plagued by their oppression and polluted by
their sins, till they brought down upon it the vengeance
of long-suffering Heaven.<a id="FNanchor2_40_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_40_45">[40]</a></p>
<p>Cleveland was less interested by this singular
monument of antiquity than by the distant view of
Stromness, which he could as yet scarce discover.
He lost no time in striking a light, by the assistance
of one of his pistols, and some wet fern supplied
him with fuel sufficient to make the appointed signal.
It had been earnestly watched for on board the
sloop; for Goffe’s incapacity became daily more apparent;
and even his most steady adherents agreed
it would be best to submit to Cleveland’s command
till they got back to the West Indies.</p>
<p>Bunce, who came with the boat to bring off his
favourite commander, danced, cursed, shouted, and
spouted for joy, when he saw him once more at
freedom. “They had already,” he said, “made
some progress in victualling the sloop, and they
might have made more, but for that drunken old
swab Goffe, who minded nothing but splicing the
main-brace.”</p>
<p>The boat’s crew were inspired with the same enthusiasm,
and rowed so hard, that, although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
tide was against them, and the air or wind failed,
they soon placed Cleveland once more on the quarter-deck
of the vessel which it was his misfortune
to command.</p>
<p>The first exercise of the Captain’s power was to
make known to Magnus Troil that he was at full
freedom to depart—that he was willing to make
him any compensation in his power, for the interruption
of his voyage to Kirkwall; and that Captain
Cleveland was desirous, if agreeable to Mr.
Troil, to pay his respects to him on board his brig—thank
him for former favours, and apologize for
the circumstances attending his detention.</p>
<p>To Bunce, who, as the most civilized of the crew,
Cleveland had intrusted this message, the old plain-dealing
Udaller made the following answer: “Tell
your Captain that I should be glad to think he had
never stopped any one upon the high sea, save such
as have suffered as little as I have. Say, too, that
if we are to continue friends, we shall be most so
at a distance; for I like the sound of his cannon-balls
as little by sea, as he would like the whistle
of a bullet by land from my rifle-gun. Say, in a
word, that I am sorry I was mistaken in him, and
that he would have done better to have reserved
for the Spaniard the usage he is bestowing on his
countrymen.”</p>
<p>“And so that is your message, old Snapcholerick?”
said Bunce—“Now, stap my vitals if I have
not a mind to do your errand for you over the left
shoulder, and teach you more respect for gentlemen
of fortune! But I won’t, and chiefly for the sake
of your two pretty wenches, not to mention my
old friend Claud Halcro, the very visage of whom
brought back all the old days of scene-shifting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
candle-snuffing. So good morrow to you, Gaffer
Seal’s-cap, and all is said that need pass between
us.”</p>
<p>No sooner did the boat put off with the pirates,
who left the brig, and now returned to their own
vessel, than Magnus, in order to avoid reposing
unnecessary confidence in the honour of these gentlemen
of fortune, as they called themselves, got his
brig under way; and, the wind coming favourably
round, and increasing as the sun rose, he crowded
all sail for Scalpa-flow, intending there to disembark
and go by land to Kirkwall, where he expected
to meet his daughters and his friend Claud Halcro.</p>

<p class="poem">
Now, Emma, now the last reflection make,<br>
What thou wouldst follow, what thou must forsake<br>
By our ill-omen’d stars and adverse Heaven,<br>
No middle object to thy choice is given.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><i>Henry and Emma.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>The sun was high in heaven; the boats were busily
fetching off from the shore the promised supply
of provisions and water, which, as many fishing
skiffs were employed in the service, were got on
board with unexpected speed, and stowed away by
the crew of the sloop, with equal dispatch. All
worked with good will; for all, save Cleveland himself,
were weary of a coast, where every moment
increased their danger, and where, which they esteemed
a worse misfortune, there was no booty to
be won. Bunce and Derrick took the immediate
direction of this duty, while Cleveland, walking
the deck alone, and in silence, only interfered from
time to time, to give some order which circumstances
required, and then relapsed into his own
sad reflections.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of men whom situations of
guilt, terror, and commotion, bring forward as prominent
agents. The first are spirits so naturally
moulded and fitted for deeds of horror, that they
stalk forth from their lurking-places like actual
demons, to work in their native element, as the
hideous apparition of the Bearded Man came forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
at Versailles, on the memorable 5th October, 1789,
the delighted executioner of the victims delivered
up to him by a bloodthirsty rabble. But Cleveland
belonged to the second class of these unfortunate
beings, who are involved in evil rather by the concurrence
of external circumstances than by natural
inclination, being, indeed, one in whom his first
engaging in this lawless mode of life, as the follower
of his father, nay, perhaps, even his pursuing it as
his father’s avenger, carried with it something of
mitigation and apology;—one also who often considered
his guilty situation with horror, and had
made repeated, though ineffectual efforts, to escape
from it.</p>
<p>Such thoughts of remorse were now rolling in his
mind, and he may be forgiven, if recollections of
Minna mingled with and aided them. He looked
around, too, on his mates, and, profligate and hardened
as he knew them to be, he could not think of
their paying the penalty of his obstinacy. “We
shall be ready to sail with the ebb tide,” he said to
himself—“why should I endanger these men, by
detaining them till the hour of danger, predicted by
that singular woman, shall arrive? Her intelligence,
howsoever acquired, has been always strangely accurate;
and her warning was as solemn as if a
mother were to apprize an erring son of his crimes,
and of his approaching punishment. Besides, what
chance is there that I can again see Minna? She
is at Kirkwall, doubtless, and to hold my course
thither would be to steer right upon the rocks. No,
I will not endanger these poor fellows—I will sail
with the ebb tide. On the desolate Hebrides, or
on the north-west coast of Ireland, I will leave the
vessel, and return hither in some disguise—yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
why should I return, since it will perhaps be only
to see Minna the bride of Mordaunt? No—let
the vessel sail with this ebb tide without me. I
will abide and take my fate.”</p>
<p>His meditations were here interrupted by Jack
Bunce, who, hailing him noble Captain, said they
were ready to sail when he pleased.</p>
<p>“When <i>you</i> please, Bunce; for I shall leave the
command with you, and go ashore at Stromness,”
said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“You shall do no such matter, by Heaven!” answered
Bunce. “The command with me, truly!
and how the devil am I to get the crew to obey
<i>me</i>? Why, even Dick Fletcher rides rusty on me
now and then. You know well enough that, without
you, we shall be all at each other’s throats in
half an hour; and, if you desert us, what a rope’s
end does it signify whether we are destroyed by the
king’s cruisers, or by each other? Come, come,
noble Captain, there are black-eyed girls enough in
the world, but where will you find so tight a sea-boat
as the little Favourite here, manned as she is
with a set of tearing lads,</p>
<p class="poem">
‘Fit to disturb the peace of all the world,<br>
And rule it when ’tis wildest?’”<br>
</p>
<p>“You are a precious fool, Jack Bunce,” said
Cleveland, half angry, and, in despite of himself,
half diverted, by the false tones and exaggerated
gesture of the stage-struck pirate.</p>
<p>“It may be so, noble Captain,” answered Bunce,
“and it may be that I have my comrades in my folly.
Here are you, now, going to play All for Love, and
the World well Lost, and yet you cannot bear a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
harmless bounce in blank verse—Well, I can talk
prose for the matter, for I have news enough to tell—and
strange news, too—ay, and stirring news to
boot.”</p>
<p>“Well, prithee deliver them (to speak thy own
cant) like a man of this world.”</p>
<p>“The Stromness fishers will accept nothing for
their provisions and trouble,” said Bunce—“there
is a wonder for you!”</p>
<p>“And for what reason, I pray?” said Cleveland;
“it is the first time I have ever heard of cash being
refused at a seaport.”</p>
<p>“True—they commonly lay the charges on as
thick as if they were caulking. But here is the
matter. The owner of the brig yonder, the father
of your fair Imoinda, stands paymaster, by way of
thanks for the civility with which we treated his
daughters, and that we may not meet our due, as
he calls it, on these shores.”</p>
<p>“It is like the frank-hearted old Udaller!” said
Cleveland; “but is he at Stromness? I thought he
was to have crossed the island for Kirkwall.”</p>
<p>“He did so purpose,” said Bunce; “but more
folks than King Duncan change the course of their
voyage. He was no sooner ashore than he was met
with by a meddling old witch of these parts, who
has her finger in every man’s pie, and by her counsel
he changed his purpose of going to Kirkwall,
and lies at anchor for the present in yonder white
house, that you may see with your glass up the lake
yonder. I am told the old woman clubbed also to
pay for the sloop’s stores. Why she should shell
out the boards I cannot conceive an idea, except
that she is said to be a witch, and may befriend us
as so many devils.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“But who told you all this?” said Cleveland,
without using his spy-glass, or seeming so much
interested in the news as his comrade had expected.</p>
<p>“Why,” replied Bunce, “I made a trip ashore
this morning to the village, and had a can with an
old acquaintance, who had been sent by Master
Troil to look after matters, and I fished it all out of
him, and more, too, than I am desirous of telling
you, noble Captain.”</p>
<p>“And who is your intelligencer?” said Cleveland;
“has he got no name?”</p>
<p>“Why, he is an old, fiddling, foppish acquaintance
of mine, called Halcro, if you must know,”
said Bunce.</p>
<p>“Halcro!” echoed Cleveland, his eyes sparkling
with surprise—“Claud Halcro?—why, he went
ashore at Inganess with Minna and her sister—Where
are they?”</p>
<p>“Why, that is just what I did not want to tell
you,” replied the confidant—“yet hang me if I can
help it, for I cannot baulk a fine situation.—That
start had a fine effect—O ay, and the spy-glass is
turned on the House of Stennis <i>now</i>!—Well, yonder
they are, it must be confessed—indifferently
well guarded, too. Some of the old witch’s people
are come over from that mountain of an island—Hoy,
as they call it; and the old gentleman has got
some fellows under arms himself. But what of
all that, noble Captain!—give you but the word,
and we snap up the wenches to-night—clap
them under hatches—man the capstern by daybreak—up
topsails—and sail with the morning
tide.”</p>
<p>“You sicken me with your villainy,” said Cleveland,
turning away from him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>“Umph!—villainy, and sicken you!” said Bunce—“Now,
pray, what have I said but what has been
done a thousand times by gentlemen of fortune
like ourselves?”</p>
<p>“Mention it not again,” said Cleveland; then
took a turn along the deck, in deep meditation,
and, coming back to Bunce, took him by the hand,
and said, “Jack, I will see her once more.”</p>
<p>“With all my heart,” said Bunce, sullenly.</p>
<p>“Once more will I see her, and it may be to
abjure at her feet this cursed trade, and expiate
my offences”——</p>
<p>“At the gallows!” said Bunce, completing the
sentence—“With all my heart!—confess and be
hanged is a most reverend proverb.”</p>
<p>“Nay—but, dear Jack!” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Dear Jack!” answered Bunce, in the same sullen
tone—“a dear sight you have been to dear
Jack. But hold your own course—I have done
with caring for you for ever—I should but sicken
you with my villainous counsels.”</p>
<p>“Now, must I soothe this silly fellow as if he
were a spoiled child,” said Cleveland, speaking at
Bunce, but not to him; “and yet he has sense
enough, and bravery enough, too; and, one would
think, kindness enough to know that men don’t
pick their words during a gale of wind.”</p>
<p>“Why, that’s true, Clement,” said Bunce, “and
there is my hand upon it—And, now I think upon’t,
you shall have your last interview, for it’s out of my
line to prevent a parting scene; and what signifies
a tide—we can sail by to-morrow’s ebb as well as
by this.”</p>
<p>Cleveland sighed, for Norna’s prediction rushed
on his mind; but the opportunity of a last meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
with Minna was too tempting to be resigned either
for presentiment or prediction.</p>
<p>“I will go presently ashore to the place where
they all are,” said Bunce; “and the payment of
these stores shall serve me for a pretext; and I will
carry any letters or message from you to Minna
with the dexterity of a valet de chambre.”</p>
<p>“But they have armed men—you may be in
danger,” said Cleveland.</p>
<p>“Not a whit—not a whit,” replied Bunce. “I
protected the wenches when they were in my power;
I warrant their father will neither wrong me, nor
see me wronged.”</p>
<p>“You say true,” said Cleveland, “it is not in his
nature. I will instantly write a note to Minna.”
And he ran down to the cabin for that purpose,
where he wasted much paper, ere, with a trembling
hand, and throbbing heart, he achieved such a letter
as he hoped might prevail on Minna to permit him
a farewell meeting on the succeeding morning.</p>
<p>His adherent, Bunce, in the meanwhile, sought
out Fletcher, of whose support to second any motion
whatever, he accounted himself perfectly sure; and,
followed by this trusty satellite, he intruded himself
on the awful presence of Hawkins the boatswain,
and Derrick the quarter-master, who were
regaling themselves with a can of rumbo, after the
fatiguing duty of the day.</p>
<p>“Here comes he can tell us,” said Derrick.—“So,
Master Lieutenant, for so we must call you now, I
think, let us have a peep into your counsels—When
will the anchor be a-trip?”</p>
<p>“When it pleases heaven, Master Quarter-master,”
answered Bunce, “for I know no more than the
stern-post.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Why, d—n my buttons,” said Derrick, “do we
not weigh this tide?”</p>
<p>“Or to-morrow’s tide, at farthest?” said the
Boatswain—“Why, what have we been slaving
the whole company for, to get all these stores
aboard?”</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” said Bunce, “you are to know that
Cupid has laid our Captain on board, carried the
vessel, and nailed down his wits under hatches.”</p>
<p>“What sort of play-stuff is all this?” said the
Boatswain, gruffly. “If you have any thing to tell
us, say it in a word, like a man.”</p>
<p>“Howsomdever,” said Fletcher, “I always think
Jack Bunce speaks like a man, and acts like a man
too—and so, d’ye see”——</p>
<p>“Hold your peace, dear Dick, best of bullybacks,
be silent,” said Bunce—“Gentlemen, in one word,
the Captain is in love.”</p>
<p>“Why, now, only think of that!” said the Boatswain;
“not but that I have been in love as often
as any man, when the ship was laid up.”</p>
<p>“Well, but,” continued Bunce, “Captain Cleveland
is in love—Yes—Prince Volscius is in love; and,
though that’s the cue for laughing on the stage, it is
no laughing matter here. He expects to meet the
girl to-morrow, for the last time; and that, we all
know, leads to another meeting, and another, and
so on till the Halcyon is down on us, and then we
may look for more kicks than halfpence.”</p>
<p>“By —,” said the Boatswain, with a sounding
oath, “we’ll have a mutiny, and not allow him to go
ashore,—eh, Derrick?”</p>
<p>“And the best way, too,” said Derrick.</p>
<p>“What d’ye think of it, Jack Bunce?” said
Fletcher, in whose ears this counsel sounded very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
sagely, but who still bent a wistful look upon his
companion.</p>
<p>“Why, look ye, gentlemen,” said Bunce, “I will
mutiny none, and stap my vitals if any of you shall!”</p>
<p>“Why, then I won’t, for one,” said Fletcher; “but
what are we to do, since howsomdever”——</p>
<p>“Stopper your jaw, Dick, will you?” said Bunce.—“Now,
Boatswain, I am partly of your mind, that
the Captain must be brought to reason by a little
wholesome force. But you all know he has the
spirit of a lion, and will do nothing unless he is
allowed to hold on his own course. Well, I’ll go
ashore and make this appointment. The girl comes
to the rendezvous in the morning, and the Captain
goes ashore—we take a good boat’s crew with us,
to row against tide and current, and we will be
ready at the signal, to jump ashore and bring off the
Captain and the girl, whether they will or no. The
pet-child will not quarrel with us, since we bring off
his whirligig along with him; and if he is still
fractious, why, we will weigh anchor without his
orders, and let him come to his senses at leisure,
and know his friends another time.”</p>
<p>“Why, this has a face with it, Master Derrick,”
said Hawkins.</p>
<p>“Jack Bunce is always right,” said Fletcher;
“howsomdever, the Captain will shoot some of us,
that is certain.”</p>
<p>“Hold your jaw, Dick,” said Bunce; “pray, who
the devil cares, do you think, whether you are shot
or hanged?”</p>
<p>“Why, it don’t much argufy for the matter of
that,” replied Dick; “howsomdever”——</p>
<p>“Be quiet, I tell you,” said his inexorable patron,
“and hear me out.—We will take him at unawares,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
so that he shall neither have time to use cutlass nor
pops; and I myself, for the dear love I bear him,
will be the first to lay him on his back. There is a
nice tight-going bit of a pinnace, that is a consort of
this chase of the Captain’s,—if I have an opportunity,
I’ll snap her up on my own account.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” said Derrick, “let you alone for keeping
on the look-out for your own comforts.”</p>
<p>“Faith, nay,” said Bunce, “I only snatch at them
when they come fairly in my way, or are purchased
by dint of my own wit; and none of you could have
fallen on such a plan as this. We shall have the
Captain with us, head, hand, and heart and all, besides
making a scene fit to finish a comedy. So I
will go ashore to make the appointment, and do
you possess some of the gentlemen who are still
sober, and fit to be trusted, with the knowledge of
our intentions.”</p>
<p>Bunce, with his friend Fletcher, departed accordingly,
and the two veteran pirates remained looking
at each other in silence, until the Boatswain
spoke at last. “Blow me, Derrick, if I like these
two daffadandilly young fellows; they are not the
true breed. Why, they are no more like the rovers
I have known, than this sloop is to a first-rate.
Why, there was old Sharpe that read prayers to his
ship’s company every Sunday, what would he have
said to have heard it proposed to bring two wenches
on board?”</p>
<p>“And what would tough old Black Beard have
said,” answered his companion, “if they had expected
to keep them to themselves? They deserve
to be made to walk the plank for their impudence;
or to be tied back to back and set a-diving, and I
care not how soon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Ay, but who is to command the ship, then?”
said Hawkins.</p>
<p>“Why, what ails you at old Goffe?” answered
Derrick.</p>
<p>“Why, he has sucked the monkey so long and
so often,” said the Boatswain, “that the best of him
is buffed. He is little better than an old woman
when he is sober, and he is roaring mad when he is
drunk—we have had enough of Goffe.”</p>
<p>“Why, then, what d’ye say to yourself, or to me,
Boatswain?” demanded the Quarter-master. “I am
content to toss up for it.”</p>
<p>“Rot it, no,” answered the Boatswain, after a
moment’s consideration; “if we were within reach
of the trade-winds, we might either of us make a
shift; but it will take all Cleveland’s navigation to
get us there; and so, I think, there is nothing like
Bunce’s project for the present. Hark, he calls for
the boat—I must go on deck and have her lowered
for his honour, d—n his eyes.”</p>
<p>The boat was lowered accordingly, made its voyage
up the lake with safety, and landed Bunce
within a few hundred yards of the old mansion-house
of Stennis. Upon arriving in front of the
house, he found that hasty measures had been taken
to put it in a state of defence, the lower windows
being barricaded, with places left for use of musketry,
and a ship-gun being placed so as to command
the entrance, which was besides guarded by
two sentinels. Bunce demanded admission at the
gate, which was briefly and unceremoniously refused,
with an exhortation to him, at the same time,
to be gone about his business before worse came of
it. As he continued, however, importunately to insist
on seeing some one of the family, and stated his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
business to be of the most urgent nature, Claud
Halcro at length appeared, and, with more peevishness
than belonged to his usual manner, that admirer
of glorious John expostulated with his old
acquaintance upon his pertinacious folly.</p>
<p>“You are,” he said, “like foolish moths fluttering
about a candle, which is sure at last to consume you.”</p>
<p>“And you,” said Bunce, “are a set of stingless
drones, whom we can smoke out of your defences at
our pleasure, with half-a-dozen of hand-grenades.”</p>
<p>“Smoke a fool’s head!” said Halcro; “take my
advice, and mind your own matters, or there will
be those upon you will smoke you to purpose.
Either begone, or tell me in two words what you
want; for you are like to receive no welcome here
save from a blunderbuss. We are men enough of
ourselves; and here is young Mordaunt Mertoun
come from Hoy, whom your Captain so nearly
murdered.”</p>
<p>“Tush, man,” said Bunce, “he did but let out a
little malapert blood.”</p>
<p>“We want no such phlebotomy here,” said Claud
Halcro; “and, besides, your patient turns out to be
nearer allied to us than either you or we thought of;
so you may think how little welcome the Captain or
any of his crew are like to be here.”</p>
<p>“Well; but what if I bring money for the stores
sent on board?”</p>
<p>“Keep it till it is asked of you,” said Halcro.
“There are two bad paymasters—he that pays too
soon, and he that does not pay at all.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, let me at least give our thanks to
the donor,” said Bunce.</p>
<p>“Keep them, too, till they are asked for,” answered
the poet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>“So this is all the welcome I have of you for old
acquaintance’ sake?” said Bunce.</p>
<p>“Why, what can I do for you, Master Altamont?”
said Halcro, somewhat moved.—“If young Mordaunt
had had his own will, he would have welcomed you
with ‘the red Burgundy, Number a thousand.’ For
God’s sake begone, else the stage direction will be,
Enter guard, and seize Altamont.”</p>
<p>“I will not give you the trouble,” said Bunce,
“but will make my exit instantly.—Stay a moment—I
had almost forgot that I have a slip of paper for
the tallest of your girls there—Minna, ay, Minna is
her name. It is a farewell from Captain Cleveland—you
cannot refuse to give it her?”</p>
<p>“Ah, poor fellow!” said Halcro—“I comprehend—I
comprehend—Farewell, fair Armida—</p>
<p class="poem">
‘’Mid pikes and ’mid bullets, ’mid tempests and fire,<br>
The danger is less than in hopeless desire!’<br>
</p>
<p class="noidt">Tell me but this—is there poetry in it?”</p>
<p>“Chokeful to the seal, with song, sonnet, and
elegy,” answered Bunce; “but let her have it
cautiously and secretly.”</p>
<p>“Tush, man!—teach me to deliver a billet-doux!—me,
who have been in the Wits’ Coffee-house, and
have seen all the toasts of the Kit-Cat Club!—Minna
shall have it, then, for old acquaintance’
sake, Mr. Altamont, and for your Captain’s sake,
too, who has less of the core of devil about him
than his trade requires. There can be no harm in
a farewell letter.”</p>
<p>“Farewell, then, old boy, for ever and a day!”
said Bunce; and seizing the poet’s hand, gave it so
hearty a gripe, that he left him roaring, and shaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
his fist, like a dog when a hot cinder has fallen on
his foot.</p>
<p>Leaving the rover to return on board the vessel,
we remain with the family of Magnus Troil, assembled
at their kinsman’s mansion of Stennis,
where they maintained a constant and careful watch
against surprise.</p>
<p>Mordaunt Mertoun had been received with much
kindness by Magnus Troil, when he came to his
assistance, with a small party of Norna’s dependants,
placed by her under his command. The
Udaller was easily satisfied that the reports instilled
into his ears by the Jagger, zealous to augment
his favour towards his more profitable customer
Cleveland, by diminishing that of Mertoun,
were without foundation. They had, indeed, been
confirmed by the good Lady Glowrowrum, and by
common fame, both of whom were pleased to represent
Mordaunt Mertoun as an arrogant pretender
to the favour of the sisters of Burgh-Westra, who
only hesitated, sultan-like, on whom he should bestow
the handkerchief. But common fame, Magnus
considered, was a common liar, and he was
sometimes disposed (where scandal was concerned)
to regard the good Lady Glowrowrum as rather an
uncommon specimen of the same genus. He therefore
received Mordaunt once more into full favour,
listened with much surprise to the claim which
Norna laid to the young man’s duty, and with no
less interest to her intention of surrendering to
him the considerable property which she had inherited
from her father. Nay, it is even probable
that, though he gave no immediate answer to her
hints concerning an union betwixt his eldest daughter
and her heir, he might think such an alliance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
recommended, as well by the young man’s personal
merits, as by the chance it gave of reuniting the
very large estate which had been divided betwixt
his own father and that of Norna. At all events,
the Udaller received his young friend with much
kindness, and he and the proprietor of the mansion
joined in intrusting to him, as the youngest and
most active of the party, the charge of commanding
the night-watch, and relieving the sentinels
around the House of Stennis.</p>

</p>
<p>Mordaunt had caused the sentinels who had been
on duty since midnight to be relieved ere the peep
of day, and having given directions that the guard
should be again changed at sunrise, he had retired
to a small parlour, and, placing his arms beside him,
was slumbering in an easy-chair, when he felt himself
pulled by the watch-cloak in which he was
enveloped.</p>
<p>“Is it sunrise,” said he, “already?” as, starting
up, he discovered the first beams lying level upon
the horizon.</p>
<p>“Mordaunt!” said a voice, every note of which
thrilled to his heart.</p>
<p>He turned his eyes on the speaker, and Brenda
Troil, to his joyful astonishment, stood before him.
As he was about to address her eagerly, he was
checked by observing the signs of sorrow and discomposure
in her pale cheeks, trembling lips, and
brimful eyes.</p>
<p>“Mordaunt,” she said, “you must do Minna and
me a favour—you must allow us to leave the house
quietly, and without alarming any one, in order to
go as far as the Standing Stones of Stennis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“What freak can this be, dearest Brenda?”
said Mordaunt, much amazed at the request—“some
Orcadian observance of superstition, perhaps;
but the time is too dangerous, and my charge
from your father too strict, that I should permit
you to pass without his consent. Consider, dearest
Brenda, I am a soldier on duty, and must obey
orders.”</p>
<p>“Mordaunt,” said Brenda, “this is no jesting
matter—Minna’s reason, nay, Minna’s life, depends
on your giving us this permission.”</p>
<p>“And for what purpose?” said Mordaunt; “let
me at least know that.”</p>
<p>“For a wild and a desperate purpose,” replied
Brenda—“It is that she may meet Cleveland.”</p>
<p>“Cleveland!” said Mordaunt—“Should the
villain come ashore, he shall be welcomed with a
shower of rifle-balls. Let me within a hundred
yards of him,” he added, grasping his piece, “and
all the mischief he has done me shall be balanced
with an ounce bullet!”</p>
<p>“His death will drive Minna frantic,” said
Brenda; “and him who injures Minna, Brenda
will never again look upon.”</p>
<p>“This is madness—raving madness!” said Mordaunt—“Consider
your honour—consider your
duty.”</p>
<p>“I can consider nothing but Minna’s danger,”
said Brenda, breaking into a flood of tears; “her
former illness was nothing to the state she has been
in all night. She holds in her hand his letter,
written in characters of fire, rather than of ink,
imploring her to see him, for a last farewell, as she
would save a mortal body, and an immortal soul;
pledging himself for her safety; and declaring no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
power shall force him from the coast till he has
seen her.—You <i>must</i> let us pass.”</p>
<p>“It is impossible!” replied Mordaunt, in great
perplexity—“This ruffian has imprecations enough,
doubtless, at his fingers’ ends—but what better
pledge has he to offer?—I cannot permit Minna
to go.”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Brenda, somewhat reproachfully,
while she dried her tears, yet still continued
sobbing, “that there is something in what Norna
spoke of betwixt Minna and you; and that you are
too jealous of this poor wretch, to allow him even
to speak with her an instant before his departure.”</p>
<p>“You are unjust,” said Mordaunt, hurt, and yet
somewhat flattered by her suspicions,—“you are
as unjust as you are imprudent. You know—you
cannot but know—that Minna is chiefly dear to me
as <i>your</i> sister. Tell me, Brenda—and tell me truly—if
I aid you in this folly, have you no suspicion
of the Pirate’s faith!”</p>
<p>“No, none,” said Brenda; “if I had any, do
you think I would urge you thus? He is wild
and unhappy, but I think we may in this trust
him.”</p>
<p>“Is the appointed place the Standing Stones, and
the time daybreak?” again demanded Mordaunt.</p>
<p>“It is, and the time is come,” said Brenda,—“for
Heaven’s sake let us depart!”</p>
<p>“I will myself,” said Mordaunt, “relieve the
sentinel at the front door for a few minutes, and
suffer you to pass.—You will not protract this interview,
so full of danger?”</p>
<p>“We will not,” said Brenda; “and you, on your
part, will not avail yourself of this unhappy man’s
venturing hither, to harm or to seize him?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Rely on my honour,” said Mordaunt—“He
shall have no harm, unless he offers any.”</p>
<p>“Then I go to call my sister,” said Brenda, and
quickly left the apartment.</p>
<p>Mordaunt considered the matter for an instant,
and then going to the sentinel at the front door, he
desired him to run instantly to the main-guard, and
order the whole to turn out with their arms—to see
the order obeyed, and to return when they were in
readiness. Meantime, he himself, he said, would
remain upon the post.</p>
<p>During the interval of the sentinel’s absence, the
front door was slowly opened, and Minna and
Brenda appeared, muffled in their mantles. The
former leaned on her sister, and kept her face bent
on the ground, as one who felt ashamed of the step
she was about to take. Brenda also passed her
lover in silence, but threw back upon him a look of
gratitude and affection, which doubled, if possible,
his anxiety for their safety.</p>
<p>The sisters, in the meanwhile, passed out of sight
of the house; when Minna, whose step, till that
time, had been faint and feeble, began to erect her
person, and to walk with a pace so firm and so swift,
that Brenda, who had some difficulty to keep up
with her, could not forbear remonstrating on the
imprudence of hurrying her spirits, and exhausting
her force, by such unnecessary haste.</p>
<p>“Fear not, my dearest sister,” said Minna; “the
spirit which I now feel will, and must, sustain me
through the dreadful interview. I could not but
move with a drooping head, and dejected pace, while
I was in view of one who must necessarily deem me
deserving of his pity, or his scorn. But you know,
my dearest Brenda, and Mordaunt shall also know,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
that the love I bore to that unhappy man, was as
pure as the rays of that sun, that is now reflected
on the waves. And I dare attest that glorious sun,
and yonder blue heaven, to bear me witness, that,
but to urge him to change his unhappy course of
life, I had not, for all the temptations this round
world holds, ever consented to see him more.”</p>
<p>As she spoke thus, in a tone which afforded much
confidence to Brenda, the sisters attained the summit
of a rising ground, whence they commanded a
full view of the Orcadian Stonehenge, consisting of
a huge circle and semicircle of the Standing Stones,
as they are called, which already glimmered a greyish
white in the rising sun, and projected far to the
westward their long gigantic shadows. At another
time, the scene would have operated powerfully on
the imaginative mind of Minna, and interested the
curiosity at least of her less sensitive sister. But,
at this moment, neither was at leisure to receive
the impressions which this stupendous monument
of antiquity is so well calculated to impress on the
feelings of those who behold it; for they saw, in
the lower lake, beneath what is termed the Bridge of
Broisgar, a boat well manned and armed, which had
disembarked one of its crew, who advanced alone,
and wrapped in a naval cloak, towards that monumental
circle which they themselves were about to
reach from another quarter.</p>
<p>“They are many, and they are armed,” said the
startled Brenda, in a whisper to her sister.</p>
<p>“It is for precaution’s sake,” answered Minna,
“which, alas, their condition renders but too necessary.
Fear no treachery from him—that, at least,
is not his vice.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, or shortly afterwards, she attained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the centre of the circle, on which, in the midst of the
tall erect pillars of rude stone that are raised around,
lies one flat and prostrate, supported by short stone
pillars, of which some relics are still visible, that had
once served, perhaps, the purpose of an altar.</p>
<p>“Here,” she said, “in heathen times (if we may
believe legends, which have cost me but too dear)
our ancestors offered sacrifices to heathen deities—and
here will I, from my soul, renounce, abjure, and
offer up to a better and a more merciful God than
was known to them, the vain ideas with which my
youthful imagination has been seduced.”</p>
<p>She stood by the prostrate table of stone, and saw
Cleveland advance towards her, with a timid pace,
and a downcast look, as different from his usual
character and bearing, as Minna’s high air and lofty
demeanour, and calm contemplative posture, were
distant from those of the love-lorn and broken-hearted
maiden, whose weight had almost borne
down the support of her sister as she left the House
of Stennis. If the belief of those is true, who assign
these singular monuments exclusively to the
Druids, Minna might have seemed the Haxa, or
high priestess of the order, from whom some champion
of the tribe expected inauguration. Or, if we
hold the circles of Gothic and Scandinavian origin,
she might have seemed a descended Vision of Freya,
the spouse of the Thundering Deity, before whom
some bold Sea-King or champion bent with an awe,
which no mere mortal terror could have inflicted
upon him. Brenda, overwhelmed with inexpressible
fear and doubt, remained a pace or two behind,
anxiously observing the motions of Cleveland, and
attending to nothing around, save to him and to her
sister.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>Cleveland approached within two yards of Minna,
and bent his head to the ground. There was a
dead pause, until Minna said, in a firm but melancholy
tone, “Unhappy man, why didst thou seek
this aggravation of our woe? Depart in peace, and
may Heaven direct thee to a better course than that
which thy life has yet held!”</p>
<p>“Heaven will not aid me,” said Cleveland, “excepting
by your voice. I came hither rude and
wild, scarce knowing that my trade, my desperate
trade, was more criminal in the sight of man or of
Heaven, than that of those privateers whom your
law acknowledges. I was bred in it, and, but for
the wishes you have encouraged me to form, I should
have perhaps died in it, desperate and impenitent.
O, do not throw me from you! let me do something
to redeem what I have done amiss, and do not leave
your own work half-finished!”</p>
<p>“Cleveland,” said Minna, “I will not reproach
you with abusing my inexperience, or with availing
yourself of those delusions which the credulity of
early youth had flung around me, and which led me
to confound your fatal course of life with the deeds
of our ancient heroes. Alas, when I saw your followers,
that illusion was no more!—but I do not
upbraid you with its having existed. Go, Cleveland;
detach yourself from those miserable wretches with
whom you are associated, and believe me, that if
Heaven yet grants you the means of distinguishing
your name by one good or glorious action, there are
eyes left in those lonely islands, that will weep as
much for joy, as—as—they must now do for sorrow.”</p>
<p>“And is this all?” said Cleveland; “and may
I not hope, that if I extricate myself from my present
associates—if I can gain my pardon by being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
as bold in the right, as I have been too often in the
wrong cause—if, after a term, I care not how long—but
still a term which may have an end, I can
boast of having redeemed my fame—may I not—may
I not hope that Minna may forgive what my
God and my country shall have pardoned?”</p>
<p>“Never, Cleveland, never!” said Minna, with
the utmost firmness; “on this spot we part, and
part for ever, and part without longer indulgence.
Think of me as of one dead, if you continue as you
now are; but if, which may Heaven grant, you
change your fatal course, think of me then as one,
whose morning and evening prayers will be for your
happiness, though she has lost her own.—Farewell,
Cleveland!”</p>
<p>He kneeled, overpowered by his own bitter feelings,
to take the hand which she held out to him,
and in that instant, his confidant Bunce, starting
from behind one of the large upright pillars, his
eyes wet with tears, exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Never saw such a parting scene on any stage!
But I’ll be d—d if you make your exit as you
expect!”</p>
<p>And so saying, ere Cleveland could employ either
remonstrance or resistance, and indeed before he
could get upon his feet, he easily secured him by
pulling him down on his back, so that two or three
of the boat’s crew seized him by the arms and legs,
and began to hurry him towards the lake. Minna
and Brenda shrieked, and attempted to fly; but
Derrick snatched up the former with as much ease
as a falcon pounces on a pigeon, while Bunce, with
an oath or two which were intended to be of a consolatory
nature, seized on Brenda; and the whole
party, with two or three of the other pirates, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
stealing from the water-side, had accompanied
them on the ambuscade, began hastily to run
towards the boat, which was left in charge of two
of their number. Their course, however, was unexpectedly
interrupted, and their criminal purpose
entirely frustrated.</p>
<p>When Mordaunt Mertoun had turned out his
guard in arms, it was with the natural purpose of
watching over the safety of the two sisters. They
had accordingly closely observed the motions of the
pirates, and when they saw so many of them leave
the boat and steal towards the place of rendezvous
assigned to Cleveland, they naturally suspected
treachery, and by cover of an old hollow way or
trench, which perhaps had anciently been connected
with the monumental circle, they had thrown themselves
unperceived between the pirates and their
boat. At the cries of the sisters, they started up
and placed themselves in the way of the ruffians,
presenting their pieces, which, notwithstanding,
they dared not fire, for fear of hurting the young
ladies, secured as they were in the rude grasp of
the marauders. Mordaunt, however, advanced with
the speed of a wild deer on Bunce, who, loath to
quit his prey, yet unable to defend himself otherwise,
turned to this side and that alternately, exposing
Brenda to the blows which Mordaunt offered
at him. This defence, however, proved in vain
against a youth, possessed of the lightest foot and
most active hand ever known in Zetland, and after
a feint or two, Mordaunt brought the pirate to the
ground with a stroke from the but of the carabine,
which he dared not use otherwise. At the same
time fire-arms were discharged on either side by
those who were liable to no such cause of forbear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ance,
and the pirates who had hold of Cleveland,
dropped him, naturally enough, to provide for their
own defence or retreat. But they only added to
the numbers of their enemies; for Cleveland, perceiving
Minna in the arms of Derrick, snatched her
from the ruffian with one hand, and with the other
shot him dead on the spot. Two or three more of
the pirates fell or were taken, the rest fled to their
boat, pushed off, then turned their broadside to the
shore, and fired repeatedly on the Orcadian party,
which they returned, with little injury on either
side. Meanwhile Mordaunt, having first seen that
the sisters were at liberty and in full flight towards
the house, advanced on Cleveland with his cutlass
drawn. The pirate presented a pistol, and calling
out at the same time,—“Mordaunt, I never missed
my aim,” he fired into the air, and threw it into
the lake; then drew his cutlass, brandished it
round his head, and flung that also as far as his
arm could send it, in the same direction. Yet
such was the universal belief of his personal strength
and resources, that Mordaunt still used precaution,
as, advancing on Cleveland, he asked if he
surrendered.</p>
<p>“I surrender to no man,” said the Pirate-captain;
“but you may see I have thrown away my weapons.”</p>
<p>He was immediately seized by some of the Orcadians
without his offering any resistance; but the
instant interference of Mordaunt prevented his being
roughly treated, or bound. The victors conducted
him to a well-secured upper apartment in
the House of Stennis, and placed a sentinel at the
door. Bunce and Fletcher, both of whom had been
stretched on the field during the skirmish, were
lodged in the same chamber; and two prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
who appeared of lower rank, were confined in a
vault belonging to the mansion.</p>
<p>Without pretending to describe the joy of Magnus
Troil, who, when awakened by the noise and
firing, found his daughters safe, and his enemy a
prisoner, we shall only say, it was so great, that he
forgot, for the time at least, to enquire what circumstances
were those which had placed them in
danger; that he hugged Mordaunt to his breast a
thousand times, as their preserver; and swore as
often by the bones of his sainted namesake, that if
he had a thousand daughters, so tight a lad, and so
true a friend, should have the choice of them, let
Lady Glowrowrum say what she would.</p>
<p>A very different scene was passing in the prison-chamber
of the unfortunate Cleveland and his associates.
The Captain sat by the window, his eyes
bent on the prospect of the sea which it presented,
and was seemingly so intent on it, as to be insensible
of the presence of the others. Jack Bunce
stood meditating some ends of verse, in order to
make his advances towards a reconciliation with
Cleveland; for he began to be sensible, from the
consequences, that the part he had played towards
his Captain, however well intended, was neither
lucky in its issue, nor likely to be well taken. His
admirer and adherent Fletcher lay half asleep, as it
seemed, on a truckle-bed in the room, without the
least attempt to interfere in the conversation which
ensued.</p>
<p>“Nay, but speak to me, Clement,” said the penitent
Lieutenant, “if it be but to swear at me for my
stupidity!</p>
<p class="poem">
‘What! not an oath?—Nay, then the world goes hard,<br>
If Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.’”<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>“I prithee peace, and be gone!” said Cleveland;
“I have one bosom friend left yet, and you will
make me bestow its contents on you, or on myself.”</p>
<p>“I have it!” said Bunce, “I have it!” and on he
went in the vein of Jaffier—</p>
<p class="poem">
“‘Then, by the hell I merit, I’ll not leave thee,<br>
Till to thyself at least thou’rt reconciled,<br>
However thy resentment deal with me!’”<br>
</p>
<p>“I pray you once more to be silent,” said Cleveland—“Is
it not enough that you have undone me
with your treachery, but you must stun me with
your silly buffoonery?—I would not have believed
<i>you</i> would have lifted a finger against me, Jack, of
any man or devil in yonder unhappy ship.”</p>
<p>“Who, I?” exclaimed Bunce, “I lift a finger
against you!—and if I did, it was in pure love, and
to make you the happiest fellow that ever trode a
deck, with your mistress beside you, and fifty fine
fellows at your command. Here is Dick Fletcher
can bear witness I did all for the best, if he would
but speak, instead of lolloping there like a Dutch
dogger laid up to be careened.—Get up, Dick, and
speak for me, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, Jack Bunce,” answered Fletcher,
raising himself with difficulty, and speaking feebly,
“I will if I can—and I always knew you spoke
and did for the best—but howsomdever, d’ye see,
it has turned out for the worst for me this time, for
I am bleeding to death, I think.”</p>
<p>“You cannot be such an ass!” said Jack Bunce,
springing to his assistance, as did Cleveland. But
human aid came too late—he sunk back on the
bed, and, turning on his face, expired without a
groan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>“I always thought him a d—d fool,” said Bunce,
as he wiped a tear from his eye, “but never such a
consummate idiot as to hop the perch so sillily.
I have lost the best follower”—and he again wiped
his eye.</p>
<p>Cleveland looked on the dead body, the rugged
features of which had remained unaltered by the
death-pang—“A bull-dog,” he said, “of the true
British breed, and, with a better counsellor, would
have been a better man.”</p>
<p>“You may say that of some other folks, too, Captain,
if you are minded to do them justice,” said
Bunce.</p>
<p>“I may indeed, and especially of yourself,” said
Cleveland, in reply.</p>
<p>“Why then, say, <i>Jack, I forgive you</i>,” said Bunce;
“it’s but a short word, and soon spoken.”</p>
<p>“I forgive you from all my soul, Jack,” said
Cleveland, who had resumed his situation at the
window; “and the rather that your folly is of little
consequence—the morning is come that must bring
ruin on us all.”</p>
<p>“What! you are thinking of the old woman’s
prophecy you spoke of?” said Bunce.</p>
<p>“It will soon be accomplished,” answered Cleveland.
“Come hither; what do you take yon large
square-rigged vessel for, that you see doubling the
headland on the east, and opening the Bay of
Stromness?”</p>
<p>“Why, I can’t make her well out,” said Bunce,
“but yonder is old Goffe, takes her for a West Indiaman
loaded with rum and sugar, I suppose, for
d—n me if he does not slip cable, and stand out to
her!”</p>
<p>“Instead of running into the shoal-water, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
was his only safety,” said Cleveland—“The fool!
the dotard! the drivelling, drunken idiot!—he will
get his flip hot enough; for yon is the Halcyon—See,
she hoists her colours and fires a broadside!
and there will soon be an end of the Fortune’s Favourite!
I only hope they will fight her to the last
plank. The Boatswain used to be stanch enough,
and so is Goffe, though an incarnate demon.—Now
she shoots away, with all the sail she can spread,
and that shows some sense.”</p>
<p>“Up goes the Jolly Hodge, the old black flag,
with the death’s head and hour-glass, and that
shows some spunk,” added his comrade.</p>
<p>“The hour-glass is turned for us, Jack, for this
bout—our sand is running fast.—Fire away yet,
my roving lads! The deep sea or the blue sky,
rather than a rope and a yard-arm!”</p>
<p>There was a moment of anxious and dead silence;
the sloop, though hard pressed, maintaining still a
running fight, and the frigate continuing in full
chase, but scarce returning a shot. At length the
vessels neared each other, so as to show that the
man-of-war intended to board the sloop, instead of
sinking her, probably to secure the plunder which
might be in the pirate vessel.</p>
<p>“Now, Goffe—now, Boatswain!” exclaimed
Cleveland, in an ecstasy of impatience, and as if
they could have heard his commands, “stand by
sheets and tacks—rake her with a broadside, when
you are under her bows, then about ship, and go
off on the other tack like a wild-goose. The sails
shiver—the helm’s a-lee—Ah!—deep-sea sink the
lubbers!—they miss stays, and the frigate runs
them aboard!”</p>
<p>Accordingly, the various manœuvres of the chase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
had brought them so near, that Cleveland, with his
spy-glass, could see the man-of-war’s-men boarding
by the yards and bowsprit, in irresistible numbers,
their naked cutlasses flashing in the sun, when, at
that critical moment, both ships were enveloped in
a cloud of thick black smoke, which suddenly arose
on board the captured pirate.</p>
<p>“Exeunt omnes!” said Bunce, with clasped hands.</p>
<p>“There went the Fortune’s Favourite, ship and
crew!” said Cleveland, at the same instant.</p>
<p>But the smoke immediately clearing away, showed
that the damage had only been partial, and that,
from want of a sufficient quantity of powder, the
pirates had failed in their desperate attempt to blow
up their vessel with the Halcyon.</p>
<p>Shortly after the action was over, Captain Weatherport
of the Halcyon sent an officer and a party of
marines to the House of Stennis, to demand from
the little garrison the pirate seamen who were their
prisoners, and, in particular, Cleveland and Bunce,
who acted as Captain and Lieutenant of the gang.</p>
<p>This was a demand which was not to be resisted,
though Magnus Troil could have wished sincerely
that the roof under which he lived had been allowed
as an asylum at least to Cleveland. But the officer’s
orders were peremptory; and he added, it was Captain
Weatherport’s intention to land the other prisoners,
and send the whole, with a sufficient escort,
across the island to Kirkwall, in order to undergo
an examination there before the civil authorities,
previous to their being sent off to London for trial
at the High Court of Admiralty. Magnus could
therefore only intercede for good usage to Cleveland,
and that he might not be stripped or plundered,
which the officer, struck by his good mien, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
compassionating his situation, readily promised.
The honest Udaller would have said something in
the way of comfort to Cleveland himself, but he
could not find words to express it, and only shook
his head.</p>
<p>“Old friend,” said Cleveland, “you may have
much to complain of—yet you pity instead of exulting
over me—for the sake of you and yours, I will
never harm human being more. Take this from
me—my last hope, but my last temptation also”—he
drew from his bosom a pocket-pistol, and gave
it to Magnus Troil. “Remember me to—But no—let
every one forget me.—I am your prisoner,
sir,” said he to the officer.</p>
<p>“And I also,” said poor Bunce; and putting on a
theatrical countenance, he ranted, with no very perceptible
faltering in his tone, the words of Pierre:</p>
<p class="poem">

Keep off the rabble, that I may have room<br>

</p>
<p>The news of the capture of the Rover reached Kirkwall,
about an hour before noon, and filled all men
with wonder and with joy. Little business was
that day done at the Fair, whilst people of all ages
and occupations streamed from the place to see the
prisoners as they were marched towards Kirkwall,
and to triumph in the different appearance which
they now bore, from that which they had formerly
exhibited when ranting, swaggering, and bullying
in the streets of that town. The bayonets of the
marines were soon seen to glisten in the sun, and
then came on the melancholy troop of captives,
handcuffed two and two together. Their finery had
been partly torn from them by their captors, partly
hung in rags about them; many were wounded and
covered with blood, many blackened and scorched
with the explosion, by which a few of the most desperate
had in vain striven to blow up the vessel.
Most of them seemed sullen and impenitent, some
were more becomingly affected with their condition,
and a few braved it out, and sung the same
ribald songs to which they had made the streets of
Kirkwall ring when they were in their frolics.</p>
<p>The Boatswain and Goffe, coupled together, exhausted
themselves in threats and imprecations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
against each other; the former charging Goffe with
want of seamanship, and the latter alleging that the
Boatswain had prevented him from firing the powder
that was stowed forward, and so sending them
all to the other world together. Last came Cleveland
and Bunce, who were permitted to walk unshackled;
the decent melancholy, yet resolved
manner of the former, contrasting strongly with the
stage strut and swagger which poor Jack thought
it fitting to assume, in order to conceal some less
dignified emotions. The former was looked upon
with compassion, the latter with a mixture of scorn
and pity; while most of the others inspired horror,
and even fear, by their looks and their language.</p>
<p>There was one individual in Kirkwall, who was so
far from hastening to see the sight which attracted
all eyes, that he was not even aware of the event
which agitated the town. This was the elder Mertoun,
whose residence Kirkwall had been for two
or three days, part of which had been spent in attending
to some judicial proceedings, undertaken at
the instance of the Procurator Fiscal, against that
grave professor, Bryce Snailsfoot. In consequence
of an inquisition into the proceedings of this worthy
trader, Cleveland’s chest, with his papers and
other matters therein contained, had been restored
to Mertoun, as the lawful custodier thereof, until
the right owner should be in a situation to establish
his right to them. Mertoun was at first desirous to
throw back upon Justice the charge which she was
disposed to intrust him with; but, on perusing one
or two of the papers, he hastily changed his mind—in
broken words, requested the Magistrate to let
the chest be sent to his lodgings, and, hastening
homeward, bolted himself into the room, to consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
and digest the singular information which chance
had thus conveyed to him, and which increased, in
a tenfold degree, his impatience for an interview
with the mysterious Norna of the Fitful-head.</p>
<p>It may be remembered that she had required of
him, when they met in the Churchyard of Saint
Ninian, to attend in the outer isle of the Cathedral
of Saint Magnus, at the hour of noon, on the fifth
day of the Fair of Saint Olla, there to meet a person
by whom the fate of Mordaunt would be explained
to him.—“It must be herself,” he said;
“and that I should see her at this moment is indispensable.
How to find her sooner, I know not;
and better lose a few hours even in this exigence,
than offend her by a premature attempt to force
myself on her presence.”</p>
<p>Long, therefore, before noon—long before the
town of Kirkwall was agitated by the news of the
events on the other side of the island, the elder
Mertoun was pacing the deserted aisle of the Cathedral,
awaiting, with agonizing eagerness, the
expected communication from Norna. The bell
tolled twelve—no door opened—no one was seen
to enter the Cathedral; but the last sounds had
not ceased to reverberate through the vaulted roof,
when, gliding from one of the interior side-aisles,
Norna stood before him. Mertoun, indifferent to
the apparent mystery of her sudden approach, (with
the secret of which the reader is acquainted,) went
up to her at once, with the earnest ejaculation—“Ulla—Ulla
Troil—aid me to save our unhappy
boy!”</p>
<p>“To Ulla Troil,” said Norna, “I answer not—I
gave that name to the winds, on the night that
cost me a father!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>”</p>
<p>“Speak not of that night of horror,” said Mertoun;
“we have need of our reason—let us not
think on recollections which may destroy it; but
aid me, if thou canst, to save our unfortunate
child!”</p>
<p>“Vaughan,” answered Norna, “he is already
saved—long since saved; think you a mother’s
hand—and that of such a mother as I am—would
await your crawling, tardy, ineffectual assistance?
No, Vaughan—I make myself known to you, but
to show my triumph over you—it is the only revenge
which the powerful Norna permits herself to
take for the wrongs of Ulla Troil.”</p>
<p>“Have you indeed saved him—saved him from
the murderous crew?” said Mertoun, or Vaughan—“speak!—and
speak truth!—I will believe every
thing—all you would require me to assent to!—prove
to me only he is escaped and safe!”</p>
<p>“Escaped and safe, by my means,” said Norna—“safe,
and in assurance of an honoured and happy
alliance. Yes, great unbeliever!—yes, wise and
self-opinioned infidel!—these were the works of
Norna! I knew you many a year since; but never
had I made myself known to you, save with the
triumphant consciousness of having controlled the
destiny that threatened my son. All combined
against him—planets which threatened drowning—combinations
which menaced blood—but my
skill was superior to all.—I arranged—I combined—I
found means—I made them—each disaster
has been averted;—and what infidel on earth, or
stubborn demon beyond the bounds of earth, shall
hereafter deny my power?”</p>
<p>The wild ecstasy with which she spoke, so much
resembled triumphant insanity, that Mertoun an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>swered—“Were
your pretensions less lofty, and
your speech more plain, I should be better assured
of my son’s safety.”</p>
<p>“Doubt on, vain sceptic!” said Norna—“And
yet know, that not only is our son safe, but vengeance
is mine, though I sought it not—vengeance
on the powerful implement of the darker Influences
by whom my schemes were so often thwarted, and
even the life of my son endangered.—Yes, take it
as a guarantee of the truth of my speech, that
Cleveland—the pirate Cleveland—even now enters
Kirkwall as a prisoner, and will soon expiate with
his life the having shed blood which is of kin to
Norna’s.”</p>
<p>“Who didst thou say was prisoner?” exclaimed
Mertoun, with a voice of thunder—“<i>Who</i>, woman,
didst thou say should expiate his crimes with his
life?”</p>
<p>“Cleveland—the pirate Cleveland!” answered
Norna; “and by me, whose counsel he scorned, he
has been permitted to meet his fate.”</p>
<p>“Thou most wretched of women!” said Mertoun,
speaking from between his clenched teeth,—“thou
hast slain thy son, as well as thy father!”</p>
<p>“My son!—what son?—what mean you?—Mordaunt
is your son—your only son!” exclaimed
Norna—“is he not?—tell me quickly—is he not?”</p>
<p>“Mordaunt is indeed <i>my</i> son,” said Mertoun—“the
laws, at least, gave him to me as such—But,
O unhappy Ulla! Cleveland is your son as well
as mine—blood of our blood, bone of our bone;
and if you have given him to death, I will end my
wretched life along with him!”</p>
<p>“Stay—hold—stop, Vaughan!” said Norna; “I
am not yet overcome—prove but to me the truth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of what you say, I would find help, if I should evoke
hell!—But prove your words, else believe them I
cannot.”</p>
<p>“<i>Thou</i> help! wretched, overweening woman!—in
what have thy combinations and thy stratagems—the
legerdemain of lunacy—the mere quackery
of insanity—in what have these involved thee?—and
yet I will speak to thee as reasonable—nay, I
will admit thee as powerful—Hear, then, Ulla, the
proofs which you demand, and find a remedy, if
thou canst:—</p>
<p>“When I fled from Orkney,” he continued, after
a pause—“it is now five-and-twenty years since—I
bore with me the unhappy offspring to whom
you had given light. It was sent to me by one of
your kinswomen, with an account of your illness,
which was soon followed by a generally received
belief of your death. It avails not to tell in what
misery I left Europe. I found refuge in Hispaniola,
wherein a fair young Spaniard undertook the task
of comforter. I married her—she became mother
of the youth called Mordaunt Mertoun.”</p>
<p>“You married her!” said Norna, in a tone of
deep reproach.</p>
<p>“I did, Ulla,” answered Mertoun; “but you were
avenged. She proved faithless, and her infidelity
left me in doubts whether the child she bore had a
right to call me father—But I also was avenged.”</p>
<p>“You murdered her!” said Norna, with a dreadful
shriek.</p>
<p>“I did that,” said Mertoun, without a more direct
reply, “which made an instant flight from Hispaniola
necessary. Your son I carried with me to
Tortuga, where we had a small settlement. Mordaunt
Vaughan, my son by marriage, about three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
or four years younger, was residing in Port-Royal,
for the advantages of an English education. I resolved
never to see him again, but I continued to
support him. Our settlement was plundered by
the Spaniards, when Clement was but fifteen—Want
came to aid despair and a troubled conscience. I
became a corsair, and involved Clement in the same
desperate trade. His skill and bravery, though
then a mere boy, gained him a separate command;
and after a lapse of two or three years, while we
were on different cruises, my crew rose on me, and
left me for dead on the beach of one of the Bermudas.
I recovered, however, and my first enquiries,
after a tedious illness, were after Clement.
He, I heard, had been also marooned by a rebellious
crew, and put ashore on a desert islet, to perish with
want—I believed he had so perished.”</p>
<p>“And what assures you that he did not?” said
Ulla; “or how comes this Cleveland to be identified
with Vaughan?”</p>
<p>“To change a name is common with such adventurers,”
answered Mertoun, “and Clement had
apparently found that of Vaughan had become too
notorious—and this change, in his case, prevented
me from hearing any tidings of him. It was then
that remorse seized me, and that, detesting all nature,
but especially the sex to which Louisa belonged,
I resolved to do penance in the wild islands of
Zetland for the rest of my life. To subject myself
to fasts and to the scourge, was the advice of the
holy Catholic priests, whom I consulted. But I
devised a nobler penance—I determined to bring
with me the unhappy boy Mordaunt, and to keep
always before me the living memorial of my misery
and my guilt. I have done so, and I have thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
over both, till reason has often trembled on her
throne. And now, to drive me to utter madness,
my Clement—my own, my undoubted son, revives
from the dead to be consigned to an infamous death,
by the machinations of his own mother!”</p>
<p>“Away, away!” said Norna, with a laugh, when
she had heard the story to an end, “this is a legend
framed by the old corsair, to interest my aid in favour
of a guilty comrade. How could I mistake Mordaunt
for my son, their ages being so different?”</p>
<p>“The dark complexion and manly stature may
have done much,” said Basil Mertoun; “strong
imagination must have done the rest.”</p>
<p>“But, give me proofs—give me proofs that this
Cleveland is my son, and, believe me, this sun shall
sooner sink in the east, than they shall have power
to harm a hair of his head.”</p>
<p>“These papers, these journals,” said Mertoun,
offering the pocket-book.</p>
<p>“I cannot read them,” she said, after an effort,
“my brain is dizzy.”</p>
<p>“Clement has also tokens which you may remember,
but they must have become the booty of his
captors. He had a silver box with a Runic inscription,
with which in far other days you presented me—a
golden chaplet.”</p>
<p>“A box!” said Norna, hastily; “Cleveland gave
me one but a day since—I have never looked at
it till now.”</p>
<p>Eagerly she pulled it out—eagerly examined the
legend around the lid, and as eagerly exclaimed—“They
may now indeed call me Reimkennar, for by
this rhyme I know myself murderess of my son,
as well as of my father!”</p>
<p>The conviction of the strong delusion under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
which she had laboured, was so overwhelming, that
she sunk down at the foot of one of the pillars—Mertoun
shouted for help, though in despair of
receiving any; the sexton, however, entered, and,
hopeless of all assistance from Norna, the distracted
father rushed out, to learn, if possible, the fate of
his son.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>Beggar’s Opera.</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>Captain Weatherport had, before this time, reached
Kirkwall in person, and was received with great joy
and thankfulness by the Magistrates, who had assembled
in council for the purpose. The Provost, in
particular, expressed himself delighted with the providential
arrival of the Halcyon, at the very conjuncture
when the Pirate could not escape her.
The Captain looked a little surprised, and said—“For
that, sir, you may thank the information you
yourself supplied.”</p>
<p>“That I supplied?” said the Provost, somewhat
astonished.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Captain Weatherport, “I
understand you to be George Torfe, Chief Magistrate
of Kirkwall, who subscribes this letter.”</p>
<p>The astonished Provost took the letter addressed
to Captain Weatherport of the Halcyon, stating the
arrival, force, &amp;c., of the pirates’ vessel; but adding,
that they had heard of the Halcyon being on the
coast, and that they were on their guard and ready
to baffle her, by going among the shoals, and through
the islands, and holms, where the frigate could not
easily follow; and at the worst, they were desperate
enough to propose running the sloop ashore and
blowing her up, by which much booty and treasure
would be lost to the captors. The letter, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
suggested, that the Halcyon should cruise betwixt
Duncansbay Head and Cape Wrath, for two or three
days, to relieve the pirates of the alarm her neighbourhood
occasioned, and lull them into security,
the more especially as the letter-writer knew it to
be their intention, if the frigate left the coast, to go
into Stromness Bay, and there put their guns ashore
for some necessary repairs, or even for careening
their vessel, if they could find means. The letter
concluded by assuring Captain Weatherport, that,
if he could bring his frigate into Stromness Bay on
the morning of the 24th of August, he would have
a good bargain of the pirates—if sooner, he was not
unlikely to miss them.</p>
<p>“This letter is not of my writing or subscribing,
Captain Weatherport,” said the Provost; “nor
would I have ventured to advise any delay in your
coming hither.”</p>
<p>The Captain was surprised in his turn. “All I
know is, that it reached me when I was in the bay
of Thurso, and that I gave the boat’s crew that
brought it five dollars for crossing the Pentland
Frith in very rough weather. They had a dumb
dwarf as cockswain, the ugliest urchin my eyes ever
opened upon. I give you much credit for the accuracy
of your intelligence, Mr. Provost.”</p>
<p>“It is lucky as it is,” said the Provost; “yet I
question whether the writer of this letter would not
rather that you had found the nest cold and the
bird flown.”</p>
<p>So saying, he handed the letter to Magnus Troil,
who returned it with a smile, but without any observation,
aware, doubtless, with the sagacious reader,
that Norna had her own reasons for calculating
with accuracy on the date of the Halcyon’s arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>Without puzzling himself farther concerning a
circumstance which seemed inexplicable, the Captain
requested that the examinations might proceed;
and Cleveland and Altamont, as he chose to be called,
were brought up the first of the pirate crew, on the
charge of having acted as Captain and Lieutenant.
They had just commenced the examination, when,
after some expostulation with the officers who kept
the door, Basil Mertoun burst into the apartment and
exclaimed, “Take the old victim for the young one!—I
am Basil Vaughan, too well known on the windward
station—take my life, and spare my son’s!”</p>
<p>All were astonished, and none more than Magnus
Troil, who hastily explained to the Magistrates and
Captain Weatherport, that this gentleman had been
living peaceably and honestly on the Mainland of
Zetland for many years.</p>
<p>“In that case,” said the Captain, “I wash my
hands of the poor man, for he is safe, under two
proclamations of mercy; and, by my soul, when I
see them, the father and his offspring, hanging on
each other’s neck, I wish I could say as much for
the son.”</p>
<p>“But how is it—how can it be?” said the Provost;
“we always called the old man Mertoun, and
the young, Cleveland, and now it seems they are
both named Vaughan.”</p>
<p>“Vaughan,” answered Magnus, “is a name which
I have some reason to remember; and, from what
I have lately heard from my cousin Norna, that old
man has a right to bear it.”</p>
<p>“And, I trust, the young man also,” said the
Captain, who had been looking over a memorandum.
“Listen to me a moment,” added he, addressing
the younger Vaughan, whom we have hitherto called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Cleveland. “Hark you, sir, your name is said to
be Clement Vaughan—are you the same, who, then
a mere boy, commanded a party of rovers, who,
about eight or nine years ago, pillaged a Spanish
village called Quempoa, on the Spanish Main, with
the purpose of seizing some treasure?”</p>
<p>“It will avail me nothing to deny it,” answered
the prisoner.</p>
<p>“No,” said Captain Weatherport, “but it may
do you service to admit it.—Well, the muleteers
escaped with the treasure, while you were engaged
in protecting, at the hazard of your own life, the
honour of two Spanish ladies against the brutality
of your followers. Do you remember any thing of
this?”</p>
<p>“I am sure <i>I</i> do,” said Jack Bunce; “for our
Captain here was marooned for his gallantry, and
I narrowly escaped flogging and pickling for having
taken his part.”</p>
<p>“When these points are established,” said Captain
Weatherport, “Vaughan’s life is safe—the
women he saved were persons of quality, daughters
to the governor of the province, and application was
long since made, by the grateful Spaniard, to our
government, for favour to be shown to their preserver.
I had special orders about Clement Vaughan,
when I had a commission for cruizing upon the pirates,
in the West Indies, six or seven years since.
But Vaughan was gone then as a name amongst
them; and I heard enough of Cleveland in his room.
However, Captain, be you Cleveland or Vaughan,
I think that, as the Quempoa hero, I can assure you
a free pardon when you arrive in London.”</p>
<p>Cleveland bowed, and the blood mounted to his
face. Mertoun fell on his knees, and exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
himself in thanksgiving to Heaven. They were
removed, amidst the sympathizing sobs of the
spectators.</p>
<p>“And now, good Master Lieutenant, what have
you got to say for yourself?” said Captain Weatherport
to the ci-devant Roscius.</p>
<p>“Why, little or nothing, please your honour;
only that I wish your honour could find my name
in that book of mercy you have in your hand; for
I stood by Captain Clement Vaughan in that Quempoa
business.”</p>
<p>“You call yourself Frederick Altamont?” said
Captain Weatherport. “I can see no such name
here; one John Bounce, or Bunce, the lady put on
her tablets.”</p>
<p>“Why, that is me—that is I myself, Captain—I
can prove it; and I am determined, though the
sound be something plebeian, rather to live Jack
Bunce, than to hang as Frederick Altamont.”</p>
<p>“In that case,” said the Captain, “I can give
you some hopes as John Bunce.”</p>
<p>“Thank your noble worship!” shouted Bunce;
then changing his tone, he said, “Ah, since an alias
has such virtue, poor Dick Fletcher might have
come off as Timothy Tugmutton; but howsomdever,
d’ye see, to use his own phrase”——</p>
<p>“Away with the Lieutenant,” said the Captain,
“and bring forward Goffe and the other fellows;
there will be ropes reeved for some of them, I think.”
And this prediction promised to be amply fulfilled,
so strong was the proof which was brought against
them.</p>
<p>The Halcyon was accordingly ordered round to
carry the whole prisoners to London, for which she
set sail in the course of two days.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>During the time that the unfortunate Cleveland
remained at Kirkwall, he was treated with civility
by the Captain of the Halcyon; and the kindness
of his old acquaintance, Magnus Troil, who knew
in secret how closely he was allied to his blood,
pressed on him accommodations of every kind, more
than he could be prevailed on to accept.</p>
<p>Norna, whose interest in the unhappy prisoner
was still more deep, was at this time unable to express
it. The sexton had found her lying on the
pavement in a swoon, and when she recovered, her
mind for the time had totally lost its equipoise, and
it became necessary to place her under the restraint
of watchful attendants.</p>
<p>Of the sisters of Burgh-Westra, Cleveland only
heard that they remained ill, in consequence of the
fright to which they had been subjected, until the
evening before the Halcyon sailed, when he received,
by a private conveyance, the following billet:</p>
<div class="psmall"><p>—“Farewell, Cleveland—we part for ever, and it
is right that we should—Be virtuous and be happy.
The delusions which a solitary education and limited
acquaintance with the modern world had spread around
me, are gone and dissipated for ever. But in you, I
am sure, I have been thus far free from error—that
you are one to whom good is naturally more attractive
than evil, and whom only necessity, example, and habit,
have forced into your late course of life. Think of me
as one who no longer exists, unless you should become
as much the object of general praise, as now of general
reproach; and then think of me as one who will rejoice
in your reviving fame, though she must never see you
more!”—</p></div>
<p class="noidt">The note was signed M. T.; and Cleveland, with
a deep emotion, which he testified even by tears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
read it an hundred times over, and then clasped
it to his bosom.</p>
<p>Mordaunt Mertoun heard by letter from his
father, but in a very different style. Basil bade him
farewell for ever, and acquitted him henceforward
of the duties of a son, as one on whom he, notwithstanding
the exertions of many years, had found
himself unable to bestow the affections of a parent.
The letter informed him of a recess in the old house
of Jarlshof, in which the writer had deposited a considerable
quantity of specie and of treasure, which
he desired Mordaunt to use as his own. “You need
not fear,” the letter bore, “either that you lay yourself
under obligation to me, or that you are sharing
the spoils of piracy. What is now given over to
you, is almost entirely the property of your deceased
mother, Louisa Gonzago, and is yours by every
right. Let us forgive each other,” was the conclusion,
“as they who must meet no more.”—And
they never met more; for the elder Mertoun, against
whom no charge was ever preferred, disappeared
after the fate of Cleveland was determined, and was
generally believed to have retired into a foreign
convent.</p>
<p>The fate of Cleveland will be most briefly expressed
in a letter which Minna received within
two months after the Halcyon left Kirkwall. The
family were then assembled at Burgh-Westra, and
Mordaunt was a member of it for the time, the good
Udaller thinking he could never sufficiently repay
the activity which he had shown in the defence of
his daughters. Norna, then beginning to recover
from her temporary alienation of mind, was a guest
in the family, and Minna, who was sedulous in her
attention upon this unfortunate victim of mental de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>lusion,
was seated with her, watching each symptom
of returning reason, when the letter we allude to
was placed in her hands.</p>
<div class="psmall"><p>“Minna,” it said—“dearest Minna!—farewell,
and for ever! Believe me, I never meant you wrong—never.
From the moment I came to know you,
I resolved to detach myself from my hateful comrades,
and had framed a thousand schemes, which have proved
as vain as they deserved to be—for why, or how,
should the fate of her that is so lovely, pure, and innocent,
be involved with that of one so guilty?—Of
these dreams I will speak no more. The stern reality
of my situation is much milder than I either expected
or deserved; and the little good I did has outweighed,
in the minds of honourable and merciful judges, much
that was evil and criminal. I have not only been exempted
from the ignominious death to which several of
my compeers are sentenced; but Captain Weatherport,
about once more to sail for the Spanish Main, under the
apprehension of an immediate war with that country, has
generously solicited and obtained permission to employ
me, and two or three more of my less guilty associates,
in the same service—a measure recommended to himself
by his own generous compassion, and to others by
our knowledge of the coast, and of local circumstances,
which, by whatever means acquired, we now hope to
use for the service of our country. Minna, you will
hear my name pronounced with honour, or you will
never hear it again. If virtue can give happiness, I
need not wish it to you, for it is yours already.—Farewell,
Minna.”</p></div>
<p>Minna wept so bitterly over this letter, that it
attracted the attention of the convalescent Norna.
She snatched it from the hand of her kinswoman,
and read it over at first with the confused air of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
to whom it conveyed no intelligence—then with a
dawn of recollection—then with a burst of mingled
joy and grief, in which she dropped it from her
hand. Minna snatched it up, and retired with her
treasure to her own apartment.</p>
<p>From that time Norna appeared to assume a different
character. Her dress was changed to one of
a more simple and less imposing appearance. Her
dwarf was dismissed, with ample provision for his
future comfort. She showed no desire of resuming
her erratic life; and directed her observatory, as it
might be called, on Fitful-head, to be dismantled.
She refused the name of Norna, and would only be
addressed by her real appellation of Ulla Troil.
But the most important change remained behind.
Formerly, from the dreadful dictates of spiritual
despair, arising out of the circumstances of her
father’s death, she seemed to have considered herself
as an outcast from divine grace; besides, that, enveloped
in the vain occult sciences which she pretended
to practise, her study, like that of Chaucer’s
physician, had been “but little in the Bible.” Now,
the sacred volume was seldom laid aside; and, to the
poor ignorant people who came as formerly to invoke
her power over the elements, she only replied—“<i>The
winds are in the hollow of His hand.</i>”—Her
conversion was not, perhaps, altogether rational;
for this, the state of a mind disordered by such a
complication of horrid incidents, probably prevented.
But it seemed to be sincere, and was certainly useful.
She appeared deeply to repent of her former
presumptuous attempts to interfere with the course
of human events, superintended as they are by far
higher powers, and expressed bitter compunction
when such her former pretensions were in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
manner recalled to her memory. She still showed
a partiality to Mordaunt, though, perhaps, arising
chiefly from habit; nor was it easy to know how
much or how little she remembered of the complicated
events in which she had been connected.
When she died, which was about four years after
the events we have commemorated, it was found
that, at the special and earnest request of Minna
Troil, she had conveyed her very considerable property
to Brenda. A clause in her will specially
directed, that all the books, implements of her laboratory,
and other things connected with her former
studies, should be committed to the flames.</p>
<p>About two years before Norna’s death, Brenda
was wedded to Mordaunt Mertoun. It was some
time before old Magnus Troil, with all his affection
for his daughter, and all his partiality for Mordaunt,
was able frankly to reconcile himself to this match.
But Mordaunt’s accomplishments were peculiarly
to the Udaller’s taste, and the old man felt the impossibility
of supplying his place in his family so
absolutely, that at length his Norse blood gave way
to the natural feeling of the heart, and he comforted
his pride while he looked around him, and saw
what he considered as the encroachments of the
Scottish gentry upon <small>THE COUNTRY</small>, (so Zetland
is fondly termed by its inhabitants,) that as well
“his daughter married the son of an English pirate,
as of a Scottish thief,” in scornful allusion to the
Highland and Border families, to whom Zetland
owes many respectable landholders; but whose ancestors
were generally esteemed more renowned for
ancient family and high courage, than for accurately
regarding the trifling distinctions of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>. The jovial old man lived to the extremity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of human life, with the happy prospect of a numerous
succession in the family of his younger daughter;
and having his board cheered alternately by
the minstrelsy of Claud Halcro, and enlightened by
the lucubrations of Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, who,
laying aside his high pretensions, was, when he
became better acquainted with the manners of the
islanders, and remembered the various misadventures
which had attended his premature attempts
at reformation, an honest and useful representative
of his principal, and never so happy as when he
could escape from the spare commons of his sister
Barbara, to the genial table of the Udaller. Barbara’s
temper also was much softened by the unexpected
restoration of the horn of silver coins, (the
property of Norna,) which she had concealed in
the mansion of old Stourburgh, for achieving some
of her mysterious plans, but which she now restored
to those by whom it had been accidentally discovered,
with an intimation, however, that it would
again disappear unless a reasonable portion was
expended on the sustenance of the family, a precaution
to which Tronda Dronsdaughter (probably
an agent of Norna’s) owed her escape from a slow and
wasting death by inanition.</p>
<p>Mordaunt and Brenda were as happy as our mortal
condition permits us to be. They admired and
loved each other—enjoyed easy circumstances—had
duties to discharge which they did not neglect;
and, clear in conscience as light of heart, laughed,
sung, danced, daffed the world aside, and bid it pass.</p>
<p>But Minna—the high-minded and imaginative
Minna—she, gifted with such depth of feeling and
enthusiasm, yet doomed to see both blighted in early
youth, because, with the inexperience of a disposi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>tion
equally romantic and ignorant, she had built
the fabric of her happiness on a quicksand instead
of a rock,—was she, could she be happy? Reader,
she <i>was</i> happy, for, whatever may be alleged to the
contrary by the sceptic and the scorner, to each
duty performed there is assigned a degree of mental
peace and high consciousness of honourable exertion,
corresponding to the difficulty of the task accomplished.
That rest of the body which succeeds
to hard and industrious toil, is not to be compared
to the repose which the spirit enjoys under similar
circumstances. Her resignation, however, and the
constant attention which she paid to her father, her
sister, the afflicted Norna, and to all who had claims
on her, were neither Minna’s sole nor her most
precious source of comfort. Like Norna, but under
a more regulated judgment, she learned to exchange
the visions of wild enthusiasm which had exerted
and misled her imagination, for a truer and purer
connexion with the world beyond us, than could
be learned from the sagas of heathen bards, or the
visions of later rhymers. To this she owed the
support by which she was enabled, after various
accounts of the honourable and gallant conduct of
Cleveland, to read with resignation, and even with
a sense of comfort, mingled with sorrow, that he
had at length fallen, leading the way in a gallant
and honourable enterprise, which was successfully
accomplished by those companions, to whom his
determined bravery had opened the road. Bunce,
his fantastic follower in good, as formerly in evil,
transmitted an account to Minna of this melancholy
event, in terms which showed, that though his head
was weak, his heart had not been utterly corrupted
by the lawless life which he had for some time led,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
or at least that it had been amended by the change;
and that he himself had gained credit and promotion
in the same action, seemed to be of little consequence
to him, compared with the loss of his old
captain and comrade.<a id="FNanchor2_41_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_41_46">[41]</a> Minna read the intelligence,
and thanked Heaven, even while the eyes which
she lifted up were streaming with tears, that the
death of Cleveland had been in the bed of honour;
nay, she even had the courage to add her gratitude,
that he had been snatched from a situation of temptation
ere circumstances had overcome his new-born
virtue; and so strongly did this reflection operate,
that her life, after the immediate pain of this event
had passed away, seemed not only as resigned, but
even more cheerful than before. Her thoughts,
however, were detached from the world, and only
visited it, with an interest like that which guardian
spirits take for their charge, in behalf of those
friends with whom she lived in love, or of the poor
whom she could serve and comfort. Thus passed
her life, enjoying from all who approached her, an
affection enhanced by reverence; insomuch, that
when her friends sorrowed for her death, which arrived
at a late period of her existence, they were
comforted by the fond reflection, that the humanity
which she then laid down, was the only circumstance
which had placed her, in the words of Scripture,
“a little lower than the angels!”</p>

<h2>AUTHOR’S NOTES.</h2>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote2_6_6" class="pginternal">Note I.</a>, p. 17.—<span class="smcap">Fortune-telling Rhymes.</span></p>
<p>The author has in Chapter I. supposed that a very ancient
northern custom, used by those who were accounted soothsaying
women, might have survived, though in jest rather than
earnest, among the Zetlanders, their descendants. The following
original account of such a scene will show the ancient
importance and consequence of such a prophetic character as
was assumed by Norna:—</p>
<p>“There lived in the same territory (Greenland) a woman
named Thorbiorga, who was a prophetess, and called the little
Vola, (or fatal sister,) the only one of nine sisters who survived.
Thorbiorga during the winter used to frequent the festivities of
the season, invited by those who were desirous of learning their
own fortune, and the future events which impended. Torquil
being a man of consequence in the country, it fell to his lot to
enquire how long the dearth was to endure with which the
country was then afflicted; he therefore invited the prophetess
to his house, having made liberal preparation, as was the custom,
for receiving a guest of such consequence. The seat of the
soothsayer was placed in an eminent situation, and covered
with pillows filled with the softest eider down. In the evening
she arrived, together with a person who had been sent to meet
her, and show her the way to Torquil’s habitation. She was attired
as follows: She had a sky-blue tunick, having the front
ornamented with gems from the top to the bottom, and wore
around her throat a necklace of glass beads.<a id="FNanchor2_42_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_42_47">[42]</a> Her head-gear
was of black lambskin, the lining being the fur of a white wild-cat.
She leant on a staff, having a ball at the top.<a id="FNanchor2_43_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_43_48">[43]</a> The staff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
was ornamented with brass, and the ball or globe with gems or
pebbles. She wore a Hunland (or Hungarian) girdle, to which
was attached a large pouch, in which she kept her magical implements.
Her shoes were of sealskin, dressed with the hair
outside, and secured by long and thick straps, fastened by brazen
clasps. She wore gloves of the wild-cat’s skin, with the fur
inmost. As this venerable person entered the hall, all saluted
her with due respect; but she only returned the compliments of
such as were agreeable to her. Torquil conducted her with
reverence to the seat prepared for her, and requested she would
purify the apartment and company assembled, by casting her
eyes over them. She was by no means sparing of her words.
The table being at length covered, such viands were placed
before Thorbiorga as suited her character of a soothsayer.
These were, a preparation of goat’s milk, and a mess composed
of the hearts of various animals; the prophetess made
use of a brazen spoon, and a pointless knife, the handle of
which was composed of a whale’s tooth, and ornamented with
two rings of brass. The table being removed, Torquil addressed
Thorbiorga, requesting her opinion of his house and guests, at
the same time intimating the subjects on which he and the
company were desirous to consult her.</p>
<p>“Thorbiorga replied, it was impossible for her to answer their
enquiries until she had slept a night under his roof. The next
morning, therefore, the magical apparatus necessary for her purpose
was prepared, and she then enquired, as a necessary part of
the ceremony, whether there was any female present who could
sing a magical song called ‘<i>Vardlokur</i>.’ When no songstress
such as she desired could be found, Gudrida, the daughter of
Torquil, replied, ‘I am no sorceress or soothsayer; but my nurse,
Haldisa, taught me, when in Iceland, a song called <i>Vardlokur</i>.’—‘Then
thou knowest more than I was aware of,’ said Torquil.
‘But as I am a Christian,’ continued Gudrida, ‘I consider these
rites as matters which it is unlawful to promote, and the song
itself as unlawful.’—‘Nevertheless,’ answered the soothsayer,
‘thou mayst help us in this matter without any harm to thy
religion, since the task will remain with Torquil to provide
every thing necessary for the present purpose.’ Torquil also
earnestly entreated Gudrida, till she consented to grant his
request. The females then surrounded Thorbiorga, who took
her place on a sort of elevated stage; Gudrida then sung the
magic song, with a voice so sweet and tuneful, as to excel any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
thing that had been heard by any present. The soothsayer,
delighted with the melody, returned thanks to the singer, and
then said, ‘Much I have now learned of dearth and disease
approaching the country, and many things are now clear to
me which before were hidden as well from me as others. Our
present dearth of substance shall not long endure for the present,
and plenty will in the spring succeed to scarcity. The
contagious diseases also, with which the country has been for
some time afflicted, will in a short time take their departure.
To thee, Gudrida, I can, in recompense for thy assistance on this
occasion, announce a fortune of higher import than any one
could have conjectured. You shall be married to a man of
name here in Greenland; but you shall not long enjoy that
union, for your fate recalls you to Iceland, where you shall
become the mother of a numerous and honourable family, which
shall be enlightened by a luminous ray of good fortune. So,
my daughter, wishing thee health, I bid thee farewell.’ The
prophetess, having afterwards given answers to all queries
which were put to her, either by Torquil or his guests, departed
to show her skill at another festival, to which she had
been invited for that purpose. But all which she had presaged,
either concerning the public or individuals, came truly to pass.”</p>
<p>The above narrative is taken from the Saga of Erick Randa,
as quoted by the learned Bartholine in his curious work. He
mentions similar instances, particularly of one Heida, celebrated
for her predictions, who attended festivals for the purpose, as a
modern Scotsman might say, of <i>spaeing</i> fortunes, with a gallant
<i>tail</i>, or retinue, of thirty male and fifteen female attendants.—See
<i>De Causis Contemptæ a Danis adhuc gentilibus Mortis, lib.
III., cap. 4</i>.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote2_9_10" class="pginternal">Note II.</a>, p. 32.—<span class="smcap">Promise of Odin.</span></p>
<p>Although the Father of Scandinavian mythology has been
as a deity long forgotten in the archipelago, which was once a
very small part of his realm, yet even at this day his name continues
to be occasionally attested as security for a promise.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe, that the rites with which such attestations
are still made in Orkney, correspond to those of the
ancient Northmen. It appears from several authorities, that in
the Norse ritual, when an oath was imposed, he by whom it
was pledged, passed his hand, while pronouncing it, through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
massive ring of silver kept for that purpose.<a id="FNanchor2_44_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_44_49">[44]</a> In like manner,
two persons, generally lovers, desirous to take the promise of
Odin, which they considered as peculiarly binding, joined hands
through a circular hole in a sacrificial stone, which lies in the
Orcadian Stonehenge, called the Circle of Stennis, of which we
shall speak more hereafter. The ceremony is now confined to
the troth-plighting of the lower classes, but at an earlier period
may be supposed to have influenced a character like Minna in
the higher ranks.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote2_18_22" class="pginternal">Note III.</a>, p. 101.—<span class="smcap">The Pictish Burgh.</span></p>
<p>The Pictish Burgh, a fort which Nora is supposed to have
converted into her dwelling-house, has been fully described in
the Notes upon Ivanhoe, vol. xvii. p. 352, of this edition. An
account of the celebrated Castle of Mousa is there given, to
afford an opportunity of comparing it with the Saxon Castle of
Coningsburgh. It should, however, have been mentioned, that
the Castle of Mousa underwent considerable repairs at a comparatively
recent period. Accordingly, Torfæus assures us, that
even this ancient pigeon-house, composed of dry stones, was
fortification enough, not indeed to hold out a ten years’ siege,
like Troy in similar circumstances, but to wear out the patience
of the besiegers. Erland, the son of Harold the Fair-spoken,
had carried off a beautiful woman, the mother of a Norwegian
earl, also called Harold, and sheltered himself with his fair
prize in the Castle of Mousa. Earl Harold followed with an
army, and, finding the place too strong for assault, endeavoured
to reduce it by famine; but such was the length of the siege,
that the offended Earl found it necessary to listen to a treaty of
accommodation, and agreed that his mother’s honour should be
restored by marriage. This transaction took place in the beginning
of the thirteenth century, in the reign of William the
Lion of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor2_45_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2_45_50">[45]</a> It is probable that the improvements
adopted by Erland on this occasion, were those which finished
the parapet of the castle, by making it project outwards, so that
the tower of Mousa rather resembles the figure of a dice-box,
whereas others of the same kind have the form of a truncated
cone. It is easy to see how the projection of the highest parapet
would render the defence more easy and effectual.</p>

<p>While these sheets were passing through the press, I received
a letter from an honourable and learned friend, containing
the following passage, relating to a discovery in Zetland:—“Within
a few weeks, the workmen taking up the foundation
of an old wall, came on a hearth-stone, under which they found
a horn, surrounded with massive silver rings, like bracelets, and
filled with coins of the Heptarchy, in perfect preservation.
The place of finding is within a very short distance of the
[supposed] residence of Norna of the Fitful-head.”—Thus one
of the very improbable fictions of the tale is verified by a singular
coincidence.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote2_33_37" class="pginternal">Note V.</a>, p. 197.—<span class="smcap">Character of Norna.</span></p>
<p>The character of Norna is meant to be an instance of that
singular kind of insanity, during which the patient, while she
or he retains much subtlety and address for the power of imposing
upon others, is still more ingenious in endeavouring to
impose upon themselves. Indeed, maniacs of this kind may be
often observed to possess a sort of double character, in one of
which they are the being whom their distempered imagination
shapes out, and in the other, their own natural self, as seen to
exist by other people. This species of double consciousness
makes wild work with the patient’s imagination, and, judiciously
used, is perhaps a frequent means of restoring sanity of
intellect. Exterior circumstances striking the senses, often
have a powerful effect in undermining or battering the airy
castles which the disorder has excited.</p>
<p>A late medical gentleman, my particular friend, told me the
case of a lunatic patient confined in the Edinburgh Infirmary.
He was so far happy that his mental alienation was of a gay and
pleasant character, giving a kind of joyous explanation to all
that came in contact with him. He considered the large house,
numerous servants, &amp;c., of the hospital, as all matters of state
and consequence belonging to his own personal establishment,
and had no doubt of his own wealth and grandeur. One thing
alone puzzled this man of wealth. Although he was provided
with a first-rate cook and proper assistants, although his table
was regularly supplied with every delicacy of the season, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
he confessed to my friend, that by some uncommon depravity
of the palate, every thing which he ate <i>tasted of porridge</i>. This
peculiarity, of course, arose from the poor man being fed upon
nothing else, and because his stomach was not so easily deceived
as his other senses.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote2_34_38" class="pginternal">Note VI.</a>, p. 199.—<span class="smcap">Birds of Prey.</span></p>
<p>So favourable a retreat does the island of Hoy afford for birds
of prey, that instances of their ravages, which seldom occur in
other parts of the country, are not unusual there. An individual
was living in Orkney not long since, whom, while a child
in its swaddling clothes, an eagle actually transported to its nest
in the hill of Hoy. Happily the eyry being known, and the
bird instantly pursued, the child was found uninjured, playing
with the young eagles. A story of a more ludicrous transportation
was told me by the reverend clergyman who is minister
of the island. Hearing one day a strange grunting, he suspected
his servants had permitted a sow and pigs, which were
tenants of his farm-yard, to get among his barley crop. Having
in vain looked for the transgressors upon solid earth, he at
length cast his eyes upward, when he discovered one of the
litter in the talons of a large eagle, which was soaring away
with the unfortunate pig (squeaking all the while with terror)
towards her nest in the crest of Hoy.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="Note2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote2_40_45" class="pginternal">Note VII.</a>, p. 280.—<span class="smcap">The Standing Stones of Stennis.</span></p>
<p>The Standing Stones of Stennis, as by a little pleonasm this
remarkable monument is termed, furnishes an irresistible refutation
of the opinion of such antiquaries as hold that the circles
usually called Druidical, were peculiar to that race of priests.
There is every reason to believe, that the custom was as prevalent
in Scandinavia as in Gaul or Britain, and as common to
the mythology of Odin as to Druidical superstition. There is
even reason to think, that the Druids never occupied any part
of the Orkneys, and tradition, as well as history, ascribes the
Stones of Stennis to the Scandinavians. Two large sheets of
water, communicating with the sea, are connected by a causeway,
with openings permitting the tide to rise and recede, which
is called the Bridge of Broisgar. Upon the eastern tongue of
land appear the Standing Stones, arranged in the form of a half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page2_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
circle, or rather a horse-shoe, the height of the pillars being
fifteen feet and upwards. Within this circle lies a stone, probably
sacrificial. One of the pillars, a little to the westward,
is perforated with a circular hole, through which loving couples
are wont to join hands when they take the <i>Promise of Odin</i>, as
has been repeatedly mentioned in the text. The enclosure is
surrounded by barrows, and on the opposite isthmus, advancing
towards the Bridge of Broisgar, there is another monument,
of Standing Stones, which, in this case, is completely circular.
They are less in size than those on the eastern side of the lake,
their height running only from ten or twelve to fourteen feet.
This western circle is surrounded by a deep trench drawn on
the outside of the pillars; and I remarked four tumuli, or
mounds of earth, regularly disposed around it. Stonehenge
excels this Orcadian monument; but that of Stennis is, I conceive,
the only one in Britain which can be said to approach it
in consequence. All the northern nations marked by those
huge enclosures the places of popular meeting, either for religious
worship or the transaction of public business of a temporal
nature. The <i>Northern Popular Antiquities</i> contain, in an abstract
of the Eyrbiggia Saga, a particular account of the manner
in which the Helga Fels, or Holy Rock, was set apart by the
Pontiff Thorolf for solemn occasions.</p>
<p>I need only add, that, different from the monument on Salisbury
Plain, the stones which were used in the Orcadian circle
seem to have been raised from a quarry upon the spot, of which
the marks are visible.</p>

<h2>EDITOR’S NOTES.</h2>
<p><a id="Footnote2_A_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_A_7" class="pginternal"><span class="label">(<i>a</i>)</span></a> p. 17. Norna’s soothsaying. The passage quoted by
Scott from the Saga of Eric the Red may be read in its context
in “Vinland the Good,” edited by Mr. Reeves, and published
by the Clarendon Press. Eric was the discoverer of
Greenland, and father of Leif the Lucky, who found Vinland
(New England, or Nova Scotia?) about the year 1002. Leif
has a statue in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><a id="Footnote2_B_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_B_12" class="pginternal"><span class="label">(<i>b</i>)</span></a> p. 35. Islands “supposed to be haunted.” In De
Quincey’s autobiographical essay his sailor brother, Pink, describes
the terrors of those isles. One of them, the noise of a
Midnight Axe, is also found in Ceylon, in Mexico, and elsewhere.
The Editor may be permitted to refer to the legends
collected in his “Custom and Myth.”</p>
<p><a id="Footnote2_C_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_C_15" class="pginternal"><span class="label">(<i>c</i>)</span></a> p. 47. Cleveland’s song. Lockhart says that Scott, in
his later years, heard this song sung, and said, “‘Capital words!
Whose are they? Byron’s, I suppose, but I don’t remember
them.’ He was astonished when I told him that they were his
own in ‘The Pirate.’ He seemed pleased at the moment, but
said next minute, ‘You have distressed me—if memory goes
all is up with me, for that was always my strong point.’”
This was in 1828. Mrs. Arkwright was the daughter of
Stephen Kemble. She set “Hohenlinden.”</p>
<p><a id="Footnote2_D_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_D_18" class="pginternal"><span class="label">(<i>d</i>)</span></a> p. 86. “Auld Robin Gray.” In the Abbotsford MSS.
is a long correspondence between Lady Ann Lindsay and
Scott. She had known him as a child. There was a project
of editing all her poems, but perhaps her own modesty, perhaps
the quality of the work, caused this to be dropped, and
Scott only edited the ballad, with a letter of the lady’s. This
small quarto sells for some £5 when it comes into the market.
It has a frontispiece by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, and is
apparently the only book of Scott’s which is valued as a rarity
by bibliomaniacs.</p>
<p><a id="Footnote2_E_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor2_E_43" class="pginternal"><span class="label">(<i>e</i>)</span></a> p. 255. “John was a Jacobite.” In the library of a
country house in the south of England is a copy of Dryden’s
Miscellany Poems, with a laudatory autograph envoy to Judge
Jeffreys, a sufficiently thoroughgoing King’s man.</p>

of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
