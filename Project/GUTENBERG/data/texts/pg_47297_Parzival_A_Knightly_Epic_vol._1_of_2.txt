<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div>
<img alt="" class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.png" width="100" id="img_images_drop_i.png">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting, for the first time, to English readers the
greatest work of Germany's greatest mediæval poet, a
few words of introduction, alike for poem and writer,
may not be out of place. The lapse of nearly seven
hundred years, and the changes which the centuries
have worked, alike in language and in thought, would have naturally
operated to render any work unfamiliar, still more so when that work
was composed in a foreign tongue; but, indeed, it is only within the
present century that the original text of the <i>Parzival</i> has been collated
from the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> and made accessible, even in its own land, to the
general reader. But the interest which is now felt by many in the
Arthurian romances, quickened into life doubtless by the genius of
the late Poet Laureate, and the fact that the greatest composer of
our time, Richard Wagner, has selected this poem as the groundwork
of that wonderful drama, which a growing consensus of opinion has
hailed as the grandest artistic achievement of this century, seem to
indicate that the time has come when the work of Wolfram von
Eschenbach may hope to receive, from a wider public than that of
his own day, the recognition which it so well deserves.</p>
<p>Of the poet himself we know but little, save from the personal
allusions scattered throughout his works; the dates of his birth and
death are alike unrecorded, but the frequent notices of contemporary
events to be found in his poems enable us to fix with tolerable certainty
the period of his literary activity, and to judge approximately the
outline of his life. Wolfram's greatest work, the <i>Parzival</i>, was apparently
written within the early years of the thirteenth century; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
makes constant allusions to events happening, and to works produced,
within the first decade of that period; and as his latest work, the
<i>Willehalm</i>, left unfinished, mentions as recent the death of the Landgrave
Herman of Thuringia, which occurred in 1216, the probability
seems to be that the <i>Parzival</i> was written within the first fifteen years
of the thirteenth century. Inasmuch, too, as this work bears no traces
of immaturity in thought or style, it is probable that the date of the
poet's birth cannot be placed much later than 1170.</p>
<p>The name, Wolfram von Eschenbach, points to Eschenbach in
Bavaria as in all probability the place of his birth, as it certainly was
of his burial. So late as the end of the seventeenth century his
tomb, with inscription, was to be seen in the Frauen-kirche of Ober-Eschenbach,
and the fact that within a short distance of the town are
to be found localities mentioned in his poems, such as Wildberg,
Abenberg, Trühending, Wertheim, etc., seems to show that there,
too, the life of the poet-knight was spent.</p>
<p>By birth, as Wolfram himself tells us, he belonged to the knightly
order (Zum Schildesamt bin Ich geboren), though whether his family
was noble or not is a disputed point, in any case Wolfram was a poor
man, as the humorous allusions which he makes to his poverty abundantly
testify. Yet he does not seem to have led the life of a wandering
singer, as did his famous contemporary, Walther von der Vogelweide;
if Wolfram journeyed, as he probably did, it was rather in search of
knightly adventures, he tells us: 'Durchstreifen muss Der Lande viel,
Wer Schildesamt verwalten will,' and though fully conscious of his
gift of song, yet he systematically exalts his office of <i>knight</i> above that
of <i>poet</i>. The period when Wolfram lived and sang, we cannot say
<i>wrote</i>, for by his own confession he could neither read nor write ('I'ne
kan decheinen buochstap,' he says in <i>Parzival</i>; and in <i>Willehalm</i>,
'Waz an den buochen steht geschrieben, Des bin Ich kunstelos
geblieben'), and his poems must, therefore, have been orally dictated,
was one peculiarly fitted to develop his special genius. Under the
rule of the Hohenstaufen the institution of knighthood had reached
its highest point of glory, and had not yet lapsed into the extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
absurdities and unrealities which characterised its period of decadence;
and the Arthurian romances which first found shape in Northern
France had just passed into Germany, there to be gladly welcomed,
and to receive at the hands of German poets the impress of an
ethical and philosophical interpretation foreign to their original form.</p>
<p>It was in these romances that Wolfram, in common with other of
his contemporaries, found his chief inspiration; in the <i>Parzival</i>, his
master-work, he has told again the story of the Quest for, and winning
of, the Grail; told it in connection with the Perceval legend, through
the medium of which, it must be remembered, the spiritualising influence
of the Grail myth first came into contact with the brilliant
chivalry and low morality of the original Arthurian romances; and told
it in a manner that is as truly mediæval in form as it is modern in
interpretation. The whole poem is instinct with the true knightly
spirit; it has been well called <i>Das Hohelied von Rittertum</i>, the
knightly song of songs, for Wolfram has seized not merely the external
but the very soul of knighthood, even as described in our own
day by another German poet; Wolfram's ideal knight, in his fidelity
to his plighted word, his noble charity towards his fellow-man, lord
of the Grail, with Its civilising, humanising influence, is a veritable
'true knight of the Holy Ghost.' In a short introduction such as
this it is impossible to discuss with any fulness the fascinating problems
connected with this poem, one can do no more than indicate
where the principal difficulties lie. These may be briefly said to be
chiefly connected with the source from which Wolfram derived his
poem, and with the interpretation of its ethical meaning. That
Wolfram drew from a French source we know from his own statement,
he quotes as his authority a certain 'Kiot the Provençal,' who,
in his turn, found his information in an Arabian <span class="smcap">MS.</span> at Toledo. Unfortunately
no such poet, and no such poem, are known to us, while we
do possess a French version of the story, <i>Li Conte del Graal</i>, by
Chrêtien de Troyes, which, so far as the greater part of the poem
(<i>i.e.</i> Books <span class="smcap">III.</span> to <span class="smcap">XIII.</span>) is concerned, shows a remarkable agreement
not only in sequence of incidents, but even in verbal correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
with Wolfram's work. Chrêtien, however, does not give either the
first two or the last three books as we find them in Wolfram. The
account of Perceval's father, and of his death, is by another hand than
Chrêtien's, and does not agree with Wolfram's account; and the
poem, left unfinished by Chrêtien, has been continued and concluded
at great length by at least three other writers, who have evidently
drawn from differing sources; whereas Wolfram's conclusion agrees
closely with his introduction, and his whole poem forms the most
harmonious and complete version of the story we possess. Wolfram
knew Chrêtien's poem, but refers to it with contempt as being the
wrong version of the tale, whereas 'Kiot' had told the venture aright.
The question then is, where did Wolfram really find those portions of
his poems which he <i>could not</i> have drawn from Chrêtien? Is 'Kiot'
a real, or a feigned, source?</p>
<p>Some German critics have opined that Wolfram really knew no
other poem than Chrêtien's, and that he boldly invented all that he
did not find there, feigning another source in order to conceal the fact.
Others have maintained that whether 'Kiot' be the name of the
writer or not, Wolfram certainly had before him a French poem other
than <i>Li Conte del Graal</i>.</p>
<p>It certainly seems in the highest degree improbable that a <i>German</i>
poet should have introduced the Angevin element, lacking in Chrêtien;
Wolfram's presentment of the Grail, too, differs <i>in toto</i> from any we
find elsewhere, with him it is not the cup of the Last Supper, but a
precious stone endowed with magical qualities. It is true that Chrêtien
does not say <i>what</i> the Grail was, but simply that '<i>du fin or esmeree</i>
<i>estoit, pieres pressieuses avoit el graal de maintes manieres</i>,' yet it seems
scarcely likely that Wolfram should have interpreted this as a precious
stone, to say nothing of sundry Oriental features peculiar to his description.
But whence Wolfram derived his idea of the Grail is a problem
which it is to be feared will never now be completely solved.</p>
<p>The discussion as to the ethical meaning Wolfram attached to the
story seems more hopeful of results, as here we do possess the requisite
data, and can study the poem for ourselves. The question between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
critics is whether Wolfram intended to teach a purely religious lesson
or not; whether the poem is an allegory of life, and Parzival a symbol
of the Soul of man, hovering between Faith and Doubt, perplexed by
the apparent injustice of God's dealings with men, and finally fighting
its way through the darkness of despair to the clear light of renewed
faith in God; or have we here a glorification of the knightly ideal?
a declaration of the poet-knight's belief that in loyal acceptance of, and
obedience to, the dictates of the knightly order, salvation is to be won?
Can the true knight, even though he lack faith in God, yet by keeping
intact his faith with man, by very loyalty and steadfastness of purpose,
win back the spiritual blessing forfeited by his youthful folly? Is
Parzival one of those at whose hands 'the Kingdom of Heaven
suffereth violence'? It may well be that <i>both</i> these interpretations are,
in a measure, true, that Wolfram found the germ of the religious idea
already existing in his French source, but that to the genius of the
German poet we owe that <i>humanising</i> of the ideal which has brought
the <i>Parzival</i> into harmony with the best aspirations of men in all
ages. This, at least, may be said with truth, that of all the romances
of the Grail cycle, there is but one which can be presented, in its
entirety, to the world of to-day with the conviction that its morality
is as true, its human interest as real, its lesson as much needed now as
it was seven hundred years ago, and that romance is the <i>Parzival</i> of
Wolfram von Eschenbach.</p>
<p>Some words as to the form of the original poem, and the method
followed in translation, may be of interest to the reader. The original
<i>Parzival</i> is a poem of some 25,000 lines, written in an irregular metre,
every two lines rhyming, <i>reim-paar</i>. Among modern German translators
considerable difference of opinion as to the best method of
rendering the original appears to exist. Simrock has retained the
original form, and adheres very closely to the text; his version certainly
gives the most accurate idea of Wolfram's style; San Marte has allowed
himself considerable freedom in versification, and, unfortunately, also
in translation; in fact, he too often gives a paraphrase rather than a
reproduction of the text. Dr. Bötticher's translation omits the Gawain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
episodes, and, though close to the original, has discarded rhyme. It
must be admitted that Wolfram is by no means easy to translate, his style
is obscure and crabbed, and it is often difficult to interpret his meanings
with any certainty. The translator felt that the two points chiefly to
be aimed at in an English version were, that it should be faithful to
the original text, and easy to read. The metre selected was chosen for
several reasons, principally on account of the length of the poem, which
seemed to render desirable a more flowing measure than the short lines
of the original; and because by selecting this metre it was possible to
retain the original form of <i>reim-paar</i>. As a general rule one line of the
English version represents two of the German poem, but the difference
of language has occasionally demanded expansion in order to do full
justice to the poet's meaning. Throughout, the translator's aim has
been to be as literal as possible, and where the differing conventionalities
of the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries have made a
change in the form of expression necessary, the <i>meaning</i> of the poet
has been reproduced, and in no instance has a different <i>idea</i> been
consciously suggested. That there must of necessity be many faults
and defects in the work the writer is fully conscious, but in the absence
of any previous English translation she can only hope that the present
may be accepted as a not altogether inadequate rendering of a great
original; if it should encourage others to study that original for themselves,
and learn to know Wolfram von Eschenbach, while at the same
time they learn better to understand Richard Wagner, she will feel
herself fully repaid.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The translator feels that it may be well to mention here the works
which have been principally relied on in preparing the English translation
and the writers to whom she is mostly indebted.</p>
<p>For the Text Bartsch's edition of the original <i>Parzival</i>, published
in <i>Deutsche Classiker des Mittelalters</i>, has been used throughout, in
connection with the modern German translation by Simrock.</p>
<p>In preparing the Notes use has been made of Dr. Bötticher's
Introduction to his translation of the <i>Parzival</i>, and the same writer's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<i>Das Hohelied von Rittertum</i>; San Marte's translation has also been
occasionally referred to.</p>
<p>The Appendix on proper names has been mainly drawn up from
Bartsch's article on the subject in <i>Germanistische Studien</i>; and that
on the Angevin allusions from Miss Norgate's <i>England under the</i>
<i>Angevin Kings</i>, though the statements have been verified by reference
to the original chronicles.</p>
<p>For all questions connected with the Perceval legend in its varying
forms the authority consulted has been <i>Studies on the Legend of the</i>
<i>Holy Grail</i>, by Mr. Alfred Nutt, to whom, personally, the translator
is indebted for much valuable advice and assistance in preparing this
book for publication.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the Introduction the poet tells of the evil of doubt and unsteadfastness—against
which he would warn both men and women; he will tell
them a tale which shall speak of truth and steadfastness, and in which
many strange marvels shall befall.</p>
<p>Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> tells how Gamuret of Anjou at the death of his father, King
Gandein, refused to become his brother's vassal, and went forth to seek fame
and love-guerdon for himself. How he fought under the Baruch before
Alexandria, and came to Patelamunt. How Queen Belakané was accused
of having caused the death of her lover Eisenhart, and was besieged by
two armies, which Friedebrand, King of Scotland, Eisenhart's uncle, had
brought against her. How Gamuret defeated her foemen, and married the
Queen, and became King of Assagog and Zassamank. How he grew weary
for lack of knightly deeds, and sailed away in secret from Queen Belakané,
and left her a letter telling of his name and race. How Feirifis was born,
and how Gamuret came to Seville.</p></div>

<span class="i0">Whoever might rule that country, 'twas the law, and none thought it shame<br></span>

<span class="i0">And he growled as a mighty lion, and the hair of his head he tare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'So the years of my lifetime a harvest of folly bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gods they had sent to my keeping a valiant and worthy friend,  <span class="linenum">665</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">If with strife he shall be o'erladen, then mine honour hath found an end;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sword and shield they shall little profit—Yea, shame he would on me cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who should bring this to my remembrance!' Then swift from his place he passed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he gat him into the portal, and a squire towards him drew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he bare a shield that was painted with a knight by a spear pierced thro',<span class="linenum">670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In Eisenhart's land was it fashioned; and a helmet his hand must hold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a sword that Rassalig carried in battle, that heathen bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now was he parted from it whose fame was in every place;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were he slain unbaptized I think me, God had shown to this hero grace!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And e'en as the Burg-grave saw it, ne'er of yore was his joy so great,<span class="linenum">675</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For the coat-of-arms he knew it—So he rode thro' the city gate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And without, his guest had halted, young hero he, not yet old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As one of a joust desirous, and his bridle the Burg-grave bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lahfilirost was his name, he grasped it, and he led him within the wall;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I wot well no other foeman that day 'neath his spear must fall.<span class="linenum">680</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Lahfilirost the Burg-grave, 'Sir Knight, thou shalt tell to me<br></span>

<span class="i0">For he of the Moors is chieftain, the men of true Eisenhart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who have brought unto us such sorrow—But now shall our woe depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a wrathful god who bade him thus seek us with all his host,  <span class="linenum">685</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But his weapons to naught are smitten, and to folly is turned his boast!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he led him in (ill it pleased him) and there met then the royal maid,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And she loosened the bands of his vizor, and her hand on his bridle laid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her care must the Burg-grave yield it: nor his squires to their task were slack,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For they turned them about, and swiftly they rode on their master's track.<span class="linenum">690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So men saw the queen so gracious lead her guest thro' the city street<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who here should be hailed the victor—Then she lighted her on her feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Ah me! but thy squires are faithful! Fear ye lest your lord be lost?<br></span>

<span class="i0">And above found he many a maiden: then her hands of dusky hue      <span class="linenum">695</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The queen set unto his harness, and disarmed the knight so true.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the bed-covering was of sable, and the couch it was spread so fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in secret a hidden honour they did for the knight prepare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For no one was there to witness—The maidens they might not stay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the door was fast closed behind them, and Frau Minne might have her way.<span class="linenum">700</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So the queen in the arms of her true love found guerdon of sweet delight,<br></span>

<span class="i0">That he did, in all truth and honour, yet heavy was he at heart,   <span class="linenum">705</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And afresh sprang the fount of his sorrow for his prince gallant Eisenhart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Burg-grave he heard of his coming; then loud rang the trumpet call,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And no man of Zassamank's princes but came to the palace hall.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They gave Gamuret thanks for the honour he had won in the field that day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Four-and-twenty had fallen before him, and their chargers he bore away,<span class="linenum">710</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And three chieftains had he made captive. And there rode in the princes' train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Many gallant knights, in the courtyard of the palace did they draw rein.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the hero had slept and eaten, and clad him in raiment fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chief host was he, for his body fit garments would they prepare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she who afore was a maiden but now was a wife would take       <span class="linenum">715</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lord by the hand, forth she led him, and unto her princes spake:<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Sir Rassalig, go thou nearer, with a kiss thou my wife shalt greet;<span class="linenum">720</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Gaschier, thou shalt do likewise.' Then the Scotch knight proud Heuteger<br></span>
<span class="i0">He bade on the lips to kiss her (and the wounds won in joust he bare).<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he bade them all be seated, and standing, he wisely spake:<br></span>

<span class="i0">That I find here no other counsel save straightway to set him free!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the queen she smiled, and bade them go swiftly and seek the knight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then thro' the throng he pressed him, that count so fair and bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet bare he the wounds of knighthood, and bravely and well had fought;<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the host of Gaschier the Norman the land of the Moors he sought.<span class="linenum">730</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He was courteous; his sire a Frenchman he was Kailet's sister's son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Killirjacac his name; in the service of fair women fair meed he won,<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the fairest of men they deemed him. When Gamuret saw his face<br></span>

<span class="i0">He bade his queen to kiss him and embrace him as kinsman true,     <span class="linenum">735</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'Now come thou and greet me!' and the knight to his arms he drew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he kissed him, and each was joyful that the other he here might meet:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Gamuret quoth unto him, 'Alas! cousin fair and sweet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What doth thy young strength in this conflict? Say, if woman hath sent thee here?'<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Nay, never a woman sent me, with my cousin I came, Gaschier,      <span class="linenum">740</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He knoweth why he hath brought me—A thousand men have I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I do to him loyal service—To Rouen in Normandy<br></span>
<span class="i0">I came, where his force was gathered, and many a youthful knight<br></span>
<span class="i0">I brought from Champagne in mine army; 'neath his banner we fain would fight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now evil hath turned against him what of cunning is hers and skill,<span class="linenum">745</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">I would fain see my kinsman Kailet, do thou bring him unto me here!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they wrought out the host's desiring, and brought him at his behest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in loving wise and kindly did Gamuret greet his guest;         <span class="linenum">750</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And ofttimes the queen embraced him, and kissed him with kisses sweet:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing it wronged her honour in such wise the prince to greet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He was cousin unto her husband, by birth was himself a king.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then smiling his host spake to him, 'God knows, 'twere an evil thing,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Now there in the Spanish country he thought him the king to greet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His kinsman and cousin Kailet, and he followed with footsteps fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Toledo, but thence had he ridden unto deeds of knighthood fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where many a spear should be splintered, and men thought not their shields to spare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he thought him to make him ready (so the venture doth tell I ween)<span class="linenum">5</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With many a blazoned spear-shaft, and many a sendal green;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For each spear it bare a pennon, with the anchor in ermine white,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And well was it wrought, the symbol, and costly in all men's sight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And long and broad were the pennons, and e'en to the hand hung low<br></span>
<span class="i0">When men on the spear-blade bound them, a span-breadth the point below.<span class="linenum">10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And a hundred spears were ready for that true and gallant knight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his cousin's folk they bare them, and with him went forth to fight;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And honour and loyal service they showed him as fit and fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor I think had their lord been wrathful that his kinsman their love should share.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know not how long he sought him, till shelter at length he found  <span class="linenum">15</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In the Waleis land: 'fore Kanvoleis were pitched on the open ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">Many tents so fair and knightly; (I speak not from fancy light<br></span>
<span class="i0">But sooth are the words I tell ye if the tale ye would hear aright)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he bade his folk to halt there, and he sent on before his face<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chief of his squires, and he bade him to seek them a resting-place.<span class="linenum">20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He would fain do his master's bidding, and swift to the town he sped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a pack-horse laden his comrades behind him led.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And never a house he saw there but its roof was a shield I trow,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the walls were hung and circled with spears in a goodly row,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the queen of the Waleis country had ordered at Kanvoleis        <span class="linenum">25</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That a Tourney fair be holden, and they ordered it in such wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">That a coward had little liked it—for whoever would seek such strife<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his will doth it chance but seldom! She was maiden, not yet a wife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And herself and two lands she offered to him who the prize should hold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many to earth had fallen in whose ear had this tale been told,  <span class="linenum">30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And he who such fall must suffer he held that his chance was o'er.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a dauntless hero showed knighthood those walls before,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a horse rushed onward as the knight spurred to onslaught fierce,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the sword-blades rang clear on each other, and spears did the shield rims pierce.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A bridge from the plain was builded that crossed o'er the river's flow,<span class="linenum">35</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twas closed by a tower-portal; nor the squire at his task was slow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he opened the gates, unwearied, when one would an entrance win.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And above it there stood the palace, and the queen sat the hall within,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she gazed from the high hall window with many a maiden fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they looked on the squires beneath them to see what had brought them there.<span class="linenum">40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt themselves had they taken counsel, and a tent did they rear on high<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the winning of love ungranted a king wrought it in days gone by,<br></span>
<span class="i0">('Twas in service of Queen Belakané). The squires laboured with might and main<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till the burden of thirty pack-steeds they raised on the grassy plain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A pavilion rich to look on, and the meadow it was so wide           <span class="linenum">45</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That the silken ropes that held it might stretch forth on either side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Gamuret, their master, ate without in the open air—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then for his courtly entrance with skill would the knight prepare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer might be delaying—His squires take the spears straightway,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they bind them fast together, and five in each band they lay,   <span class="linenum">50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the sixth in their hand they carry, with its pennon and anchor white;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So proudly into the city came riding this gallant knight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the queen she heard the tidings that a noble guest was come<br></span>
<span class="i0">From a far-off land and distant, and in sooth was he known to none.<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

<span class="i0">But now was I with his people, and they seem me from falsehood free,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they say, 'Who hath lust for riches, if he to our lord shall seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will free him from fear of scarceness!' The while I with them did speak,<span class="linenum">60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I asked them to tell of their master, and they thought not to hide the thing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But spake of a true heart freely, 'Of Zassamank is he king.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas a page who brought the tidings—'Ah me! that pavilion fair!<br></span>

<span class="i0">'Thou needst not to praise so highly, my mouth ne'er shall say thee nay,<span class="linenum">65</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A rich man shall be its owner, no lack doth he know alway.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in this wise she spake, the lady, the fair and gracious queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Why cometh he not to the castle? For fain I his face had seen.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This she bade her page to ask him—Then the hero was fain to make<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave entry into the city, and the sleepers must needs awake.       <span class="linenum">70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Many shields he saw fair shining—The blast of the trumpets clear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rang loud and long before him, and two drummers ye needs must hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">As they tossed and smote their tambours, and the walls echoed back the sound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the notes of the flutes 'twas mingled as the train through the city wound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a march that they played so gaily—Nor forget we how he must ride<span class="linenum">75</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their master and lord, he followed with the fiddlers his rein beside.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he threw his leg o'er his charger, that hero so bold and fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And boots did he wear of leather, or else had his limbs been bare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his mouth it was e'en as a ruby, and red, as a fire doth burn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And full, not too thin; fair his body wherever the eye might turn;  <span class="linenum">80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fair was his hair and curling, and wherever one saw the skin<br></span>
<span class="i0">I ween 'twas as costly cover as ever a head might win.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of samite green was his mantle, and the sable shone dark thereon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' white was his vest, and the gazers they came in a goodly throng.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many must ask the question, 'Who was he, the beardless knight   <span class="linenum">85</span><br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who rode with such pomp of riches?' Then the tale it was spread aright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For they spake it as truth who knew it—So they drew to the bridge anear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The folk of the town, and his people; and so bright was the radiance clear<br></span>
<span class="i0">That shone from the queen that it thrilled him thro' his strong limbs, that goodly knight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he braced himself as a falcon that plumeth its wings for flight,<span class="linenum">90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the lodging he deemed it goodly; so thought he that hero wise;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his hostess with joy beheld him, the lady of fair Waleis!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the king of Spain he heard it, how there stood on the open plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tent that at Rassalig's bidding Gamuret as his prize did gain<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Patelamunt, and the tidings a knight to his lord would bring—   <span class="linenum">95</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he sped as a deer, joy's vassal I ween was the gallant king!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus spake the knight, 'Thy kinsman, and the son of thine aunt I saw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with pomp and in state as aforetime, so to-day doth he hither draw;<br></span>
<span class="i0">There are floating a hundred pennons full fair by his knightly shield,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And around his high pavilion they stand on the grassy field,       <span class="linenum">100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And green as the grass the pennons, and the hero bold doth bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three anchors of snow-white ermine on every sendal fair.'<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then straightway he sent a message to Gaschier, the Norman knight,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And honour enow was his portion ere his manly courage bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">The knight o'er the seas to conflict, for his journey I sorrow sore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For there came unto him true tidings, how the Baruch, his lord of old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was beset by mighty foemen, by Babylon's princes bold:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the one he was called Ipomidon, and Pompey his brother's name  <span class="linenum">685</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(For so hath the venture told me), a proud man of warlike fame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">('Twas not he whom Julius Cæsar had driven from Rome of yore).<br></span>
<span class="i0">His uncle was Nebuchadnezzar, who in books found the lying lore<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he himself should a god be, (o'er this would our folk make sport)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of noble race these brothers, nor of strength nor of gold spared aught.<span class="linenum">690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ninus they came who was ruler ere ever Bagdad might be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nineveh did he found—Now an insult and a shame vexed them bitterly,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Baruch as vassals claimed them—So the combat was won and lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bravely the heroes battled, and on each side they paid the cost.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Gamuret sailed the water, and aid to the Baruch brought,      <span class="linenum">695</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly he bade him welcome; tho' I weep that that land he sought!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How it chanced there, how went the conflict, gain or loss, how the thing might be<br></span>
<span class="i0">Naught of that knew Queen Herzeleide; and bright as the sun was she,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And more than too much her gladness! I think me in very truth      <span class="linenum">700</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She had sped past the goal of all wishes—And on wisdom her heart was set,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she won from the whole world favour; her fair deeds with fair guerdon met,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all men praised Herzeleide, the queen, as both fair and true,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Of these twain was she aye the ruler; and beside them in far Norgals<span class="linenum">705</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Did she bear the crown and sceptre, in the city of Kingrivals.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And so dear did she hold her husband, if never a maid might win<br></span>

<span class="i0">The fiery bolts of Heaven, as they sped on their downward course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sparks sprang from her floating tresses mid the fire of the circling spheres,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a little space was she conscious, then a grip on her right hand fell,<br></span>

<span class="i0">For then did she nurse a dragon, that forth from her body sprung,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then it fled from her sight so swiftly she might look on it never more:<span class="linenum">725</span><br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she did what afore she could not, for the terror that on her lay,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Tampaneis he came riding, of her husband's squires the chief, <span class="linenum">735</span><br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>In the Introduction the poet speaks of the honour in which he holds all
true women, though he be wroth with one who has wronged him. Yet,
though women shall count him their friend, he would fain that they should
honour him for his knightly deeds, rather than for this his song.</p>
<p>In Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> he tells of the sorrow and the faith of Queen Herzeleide; of
Parzival's childhood; of his meeting with the knights; of his faring forth
to seek knighthood from King Arthur; and of the death of Herzeleide.
How Parzival met with Jeschuté, and robbed her of her token, and of the
wrath of her husband Orilus. Of the sorrow of Siguné, and how Parzival
learnt his name and his lineage. How Parzival met with the Red Knight
and bare his challenge to the court of King Arthur, and how he craved a
boon of the king. Of the shaming of Kunnewaaré; and of the death
of the Red Knight. How Parzival came to Gurnemanz of Graharz and
was cured by him of his folly and taught all knightly wisdom, and how he
rode forth from the land of Graharz.</p>

<span class="i0">And his life it fled from falsehood—Then e'en as should be his right<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave to the guest fair welcome, and with him stood nor squire nor knight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Then startled and shamed they turned them, and they whispered each to all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with bated breath the tidings ran swift through the castle hall,<br></span>

<span class="i0">I know not who sent them hither, but maidens richly dressed,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Nor many a field well-fencèd nor wayside cross he found;<br></span>

<span class="i0">And thus from the land of Graharz he rode through the livelong day, <span class="linenum">20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Till he came to the kingdom of Brobarz thro' mountains wild and high—<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When the shadows of evening lengthened, and red flushed the western sky,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he came to a mountain torrent, and the voice of the raging flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rang clear as its waves rushed foaming round the crags that amid them stood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So he rode adown by the waters till he came to the city fair        <span class="linenum">25</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which a king had bequeathed to his daughter; 'twas the city of Pelrapär,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I wot that tho' fair the maiden who bare of that land the crown,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great grief and small gladness had they who dwelt in that noble town!<br></span>

<span class="i0">And a bridge hung high above them with woven work so fair,<br></span>

<span class="i0">As children in swings delight them, and swing themselves to and fro,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So swung the bridge, yet ropeless, youthful gladness it scarce might know!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And on either side were standing, with helmets for battle bound,    <span class="linenum">35</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of knights e'en more than thirty, and they bade him to turn him round,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with lifted swords, tho' feeble, the strife would they gladly wait,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They thought 'twas the King Klamidé whom they oft had seen of late,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So royally rode the hero to the bridge o'er the field so wide—<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thus to the youth they shouted, and with one voice his arms defied,<span class="linenum">40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' he spurred his steed full sharply it shrank from the bridge in fright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But ne'er knew he a thought of terror—To the ground sprang the gallant knight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he led his horse by the bridle where the bridge hung high in air,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Too faint were a coward's courage so bitter a strife to dare!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And well must he watch his footsteps for he feared lest his steed should fall—<span class="linenum">45</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From the other side of the water the knights had ceased their call,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with shield and sword-blade gleaming within the town they passed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For they feared lest an army followed, and they closed their portals fast.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Parzival crossed the river, and he rode o'er a grassy plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where many in search of knighthood must death for their guerdon gain;<span class="linenum">50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And he came to the palace portal, and stately the Burg and high,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there hung there a ring of iron, and he gripped it right manfully.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But none to his call made answer, save only a maiden bright<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who looked forth from out her window, and was 'ware of the gallant knight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spake the maiden so fair and courteous, 'An thou comest, Sir Knight, as foe,<span class="linenum">55</span><br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

<span class="i0">And many a squire so valiant, the bravest from out the land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long, sharp, and strong were the lances they bare in each strong right hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There too, so the story telleth, was many a merchant grave,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And their skins, they were loose for hunger—Then the Marshal of the queen<br></span>

<span class="i0">That buildings so strong and so many in his lifetime he never saw,  <span class="linenum">75</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And on horse or afoot from all sides the knights to his welcome draw.<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a sorry host, for as ashes some were grey, some were pale as clay,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And their palate knew naught of the flavour of the wine-cup, or red or white,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And their doublet hung loosely on them, and wasted each limb of might,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And their skin like wrinkled leather on each rib hung gaunt and grim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For hunger their flesh had wasted and driven from every limb.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' want must they sorely suffer, little grease in their fuel ran—<span class="linenum">85</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(A hero to this had forced them, the proud King of Brandigan,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then they led Parzival in triumph to their queen so fair and young,<br></span>

<span class="i0">They would have him for lord and master; and the queen in her turn she spake,<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>Book V. tells of the wonderful adventure of the Grail Castle; how
Parzival met with the Fisher King, and became his guest; and of the great

and all the marvels of the Grail, and how be asked no question. How he
in the morning found the palace deserted, and was mocked by the squire
as he rode away. Of Parzival meeting with Siguné, and how she
reproached him for his silence. Of Orilus and Jeschuté; of the fight
between the heroes; and of Parzival's oath. How Orilus and his wife were
made friends again, and of their welcome at the court of King Arthur.</p>

<span class="i0">To a water fair, and upon it many boats at anchor lay,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Of peacock's plumes his head-gear—Then the knight to the Fisher spake<br></span>

<span class="i0">To help him unto a shelter where he might thro' the night hours rest.<span class="linenum">25</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Fisher sad he answered in this wise the stranger guest;<br></span>

<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'Nay, Sir Knight, I know not for full thirty miles around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By land alike or water, where dwelling may yet be found<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ride there to the high cliff's ending, then turn thee to thy right hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Until to the moat thou comest, and thy charger perforce must stand;<br></span>

<span class="i0">And the drawbridge was raised, and the fortress it lacked not for strength I trow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As a turner with skill had wrought them stood the turrets in goodly row.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But with wings, or on winds of heaven uplifted, might ye have won<br></span>

<span class="i0">And with ready hands and skilful of his armour they freed the guest,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And they spake, of a truth Good Fortune and blessing should be his share.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he bade them to bring him water, and the rust-stains he washed away<br></span>
<span class="i0">From face and hands, and they saw him as the light of a second day, <span class="linenum">70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So he sat in all eyes lovely—Then a mantle rich they brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of silk of Araby fashioned, and flaw therein was there naught;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he laid it around his shoulder, that hero so fair and bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But the clasp did he leave unfastened, and with one voice they praised the knight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Repanse de Schoie, our lady and queen, did this mantle bear,'      <span class="linenum">75</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth the chamberlain, 'She hath lent it while fit robes they for thee prepare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I feared not this boon to ask her since it seemeth sure to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">That a gallant man and faithful, Sir Knight, thou shalt prove to be!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">'God reward thee who lookest on me with such true and trusting heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks, an thou seest rightly, Good Fortune shall be my part,     <span class="linenum">80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I wot well such gifts come only from the power of God on high.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then gladly they pledged the hero, and in honour and loyalty<br></span>
<span class="i0">They who sorrowed with him were joyful; far more had they there, I ween,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than at Pelrapär, when his right hand their shelter from grief had been!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then sadly he thought, as his harness the squires on one side would bear,<span class="linenum">85</span><br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That in knightly joust and Tourney he here might find little share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then one to the host would call him, and fast came his words and free,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And boldly he spake to the stranger, yea, e'en as in wrath might be.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his life had he nigh paid forfeit to Parzival's youthful pride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he laid his hand to his sword-hilt—When he found it not by his side<span class="linenum">90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he clenched his fist so tightly that the clasp rung the blood-drops red<br></span>
<span class="i0">From beneath his nails, and crimson to the sleeve of his robe they spread.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nay, nay,' quoth the knights, 'be not wrathful, for fain would he make us smile,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With many a taper laden; round the walls shone the tapers' glow.   <span class="linenum">100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath stood a hundred couches, with a hundred cushions fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And each of these goodly couches four knights should between them share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And betwixt each twain of the couches an open space was found,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And before each there lay a carpet of cunning work fashioned round.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto had he wealth in plenty, King Frimutel's son and heir:     <span class="linenum">105</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And one thing had they not forgotten, nor their gold did they think to spare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For within the hall were builded three hearths of marble rare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With skill and wisdom fashioned, and each hearth stood four-square,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the wood was Lignum aloe, and so great a fire, I ween,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er hath burnt on the hearth at Wildberg—Such things have aye costly been.<span class="linenum">110</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the host had bid them lay him on a costly folding bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Fore the central hearth; and gladness from before his face had fled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his life was but a dying—Parzival the hero fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the hall found kindly welcome from him who had sent him there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then his host bade him stand no longer, but be seated his couch anear,<span class="linenum">115</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, here by my side, didst thou seat thee yet further from me, I fear<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Both wide and long, and with sable were they lined and garnished fair.<span class="linenum">120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the poorest skin was costly, and black was its hue and grey;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a cap of the self-same fashioned he wore on his head that day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas within and without of sable, with bands of Arabian gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought around, and a flashing ruby in the centre might all behold.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now many brave knights they sat there, and grief passed their face before,<span class="linenum">125</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For a squire sprang swift thro' the doorway, and a lance in his hand he bore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(And thus did he wake their weeping) from the point did the blood run fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Adown to the hand of the holder till 'twas lost in his sleeve at last.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then thro' the lofty palace was weeping and wailing sore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The folk of thirty kingdoms could scarce have bemoaned them more.  <span class="linenum">130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus to each of the four walls with the lance in his hand he drew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till he reached once again the doorway, and passed him the portal thro'.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stilled was the lamentation, and the grief that this folk must know<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the squire bare the lance before them, and thus bade them to think on woe.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(An here ye be not outwearied I gladly would tell the tale,        <span class="linenum">135</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">How the feast in this Burg was ordered, for in courtesy naught did fail.)<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At the end of the hall a doorway of steel did they open fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two noble children entered—Now hearken what guise they bare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An a knight for love would serve them, with love they his task might pay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two fair and gracious maidens as e'er man might woo were they.     <span class="linenum">140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And each wore on her hair loose flowing, a chaplet of blossoms bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">With silken band, beneath it their tresses sought the ground.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the hand of each maiden carried a candlestick all of gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And every golden socket did a burning taper hold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would I forget the raiment these gentle maidens ware,          <span class="linenum">145</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For one was Tenabroc's countess, ruddy-brown was her robe so fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the self-same garb wore the maiden who beside the countess paced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with girdles rich and costly were they girt round each slender waist.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And behind them there came a Duchess and her fellow; of ivory white<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Two stools they bare, and glowing their lips e'en as fire is bright.<span class="linenum">150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then they bowed, the four, and bending, the stools 'fore the host they laid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was aught to their service lacking, but fitly their part they played.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then they stood all four together, and their faces were fair to see,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the vesture of each fair maiden was like to the other three.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now see how they followed swiftly, fair maidens twice told four,   <span class="linenum">155</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And this was I ween their office, four tapers tall they bore;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the others deemed too heavy the weight of a precious stone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by day the sun shone thro' it, and as Jacinth its name is known.<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas long and broad, and for lightness had they fashioned it fair and meet<br></span>
<span class="i0">To serve at will for a table where a wealthy host might eat.       <span class="linenum">160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And straight to the host they stepped them, and they bowed their fair heads low,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And four laid the costly table on the ivory white as snow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stools they had placed aforetime—and courteous they turned aside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there by their four companions stood the eight in their maiden pride.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And green were the robes of these maidens, green as grass in the month of May,<span class="linenum">165</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Samite in Assagog woven, and long and wide were they.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the waist were they girt with a girdle, narrow, and long, and fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And each of these gentle maidens ware a wreath on her shining hair.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Iwan, the Count of Nonel, and Jernis, the lord of Reil,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Grail were their daughters summoned from many a distant mile.<span class="linenum">170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And they came, these two princesses, in raiment wondrous fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two keen-edged knives, a marvel, on cloths did those maidens bear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of silver white and shining were they wrought with such cunning skill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And so sharp, that methinks their edges e'en steel might they cut at will.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And maidens four went before them, for this should their office be <span class="linenum">175</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To bear lights before the silver; four children from falsehood free.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Six maidens in all they entered and took thro' the hall their way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now hearken, and I will tell ye the service they did that day.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They bowed, and the twain who carried the silver they laid it low<br></span>

<span class="i0">And now, have I counted rightly, here shall eighteen maidens stand;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! see six more come hither in vesture from distant lands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Half their robes were of silk, gold inwoven, half of silk of Nineveh bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For both they and the six before them, parti-coloured their robes of light.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And last of those maids a maiden, o'er the others was she the queen,<span class="linenum">185</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So fair her face that they thought them 'twas the morning's dawn, I ween!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they saw her clad in raiment of Pfellel of Araby,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she bare aloft on a cushion of verdant Achmardi<br></span>
<span class="i0">Root and blossom of Paradise garden, that thing which men call 'The Grail,'<br></span>
<span class="i0">The crown of all earthly wishes, fair fulness that ne'er shall fail!<span class="linenum">190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Repanse de Schoie did they call her, in whose hands the Grail might lie,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Grail Itself elected was she to this office high.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they who would here do service, those maids must be pure of heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And true in life, nor falsehood shall have in their dealings part.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And lights both rare and costly before the Grail they bore         <span class="linenum">195</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Six glasses tall, transparent—and wondrous balsam's store<br></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt within with a strange sweet perfume; with measured steps they came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen bowed low with the maidens who bare the balsam's flame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then this maiden free from falsehood, the Grail on the Jacinth laid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Parzival looked upon her, and thought of the royal maid        <span class="linenum">200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Elect to such high office, whose mantle he needs must wear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the seven courteous turned them to the eighteen maidens fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the noblest they placed in the centre, and twelve on either side<br></span>
<span class="i0">They stood, but the crownèd maiden no beauty with hers had vied!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as many knights as were seated around that palace hall,        <span class="linenum">205</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So to each four was there a server, with golden beaker tall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a page so fair to look on who bare a napkin white—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Riches enow, I trow me, had ye seen in the hall that night!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they bare there a hundred tables, at each table four knights would eat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And swiftly they spread them over with coverings fair and meet.    <span class="linenum">210</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The host himself took water, and heavy at heart was he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Parzival, too, he washed him, for so should the custom be.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A silken towel, bright coloured, a count's son would proffer fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to the guest he gat him, and knelt low before him there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wherever there stood a table there four squires were ready dight<span class="linenum">215</span><br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To serve the four who sat there, and their service they knew aright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For twain would carve, low kneeling, and twain to the knights would bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of food and drink as needful, and thus for their wants would care.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now hearken ye greater riches—on wheelèd cars were rolled<br></span>
<span class="i0">To every knight in order, fair vessels of wroughten gold,          <span class="linenum">220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And four knights set them on the tables, and with each ye a steward might see<br></span>
<span class="i0">To aid them, and claim the vessels when the feast at an end should be.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now hearken another marvel—to a hundred squires they spake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they bade them in fair white napkins the bread from the Grail to take.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway they went, and to each knight at each table the bread they bare;<span class="linenum">225</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As I heard so I tell unto ye, and the truth ye, each one, shall swear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas the Grail Itself that fed them, and before the Grail did stand<br></span>
<span class="i0">What of food or drink desiring, each one might stretch forth his hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Would I here betray another then in sooth ye shall lie with me)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Food warm or cold, or dishes that known or unknown shall be,       <span class="linenum">230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Food wild or tame—Such riches ye never on earth shall find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So many have said, yet I think me that folly doth rule their mind—<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the Grail was the crown of blessing, the fulness of earth's delight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Its joys I right well may liken to the glories of Heaven's height!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they brought in small golden vessels that which every man should need<span class="linenum">235</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sauces, or salt, or pepper—would one sparely or fully feed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet each found enough—and courteous they bare to each noble guest;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And red wine and sweet drinks luscious, each one as he liked him best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might speak the word, and proffer the cup, and behold! 'twas filled<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the power of the Grail—Thus the hunger of that gallant host was stilled,<span class="linenum">240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Grail Itself sustained them, and Parzival wondering saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The riches and mighty marvels, yet to question his host forbore.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he thought, 'Gurnemanz he bade me, in truth, without thought of guile,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To withhold my lips from question—If here I abide awhile<br></span>

<span class="i0">They will tell me, without my question, how here with this folk it stands.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then e'en as he sat thus musing came a squire who a sword did bear,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And its sheath was a thousand marks' worth, and its hilt was a ruby rare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the blade, it might well work wonders—Then the host gave it to the knight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'I full oft have borne it in many a deadly fight     <span class="linenum">250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere God's Hand thus sorely smote me; now with this shalt thou be repaid<br></span>
<span class="i0">If aught hath in care been lacking—Henceforth shalt thou bear this blade<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ah! woe to the guest that asked not, I am sorrowful for his sake,  <span class="linenum">255</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When his hand clasped the sword 'twas a token that his silence he well might break.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the host too my heart is heavy, thus tortured by nameless woe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a question therefrom had freed him, yet to question his guest was slow.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now the feast was ended, who the vessels hither bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again to their task they turn them, and they bear them forth once more.<span class="linenum">260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The cars again they circle; each maid to her task was fain<br></span>

<span class="i0">But he lacked not for other service—His fair face and tapers light<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave challenge unto each other—What day e'er might shine so bright?<br></span>
<span class="i0">And before his couch was another, thereon would he take his seat<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While pages drew them nearer, and proffered him service meet.      <span class="linenum">310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And they bared his white feet comely, and they laid his robes aside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of noble birth were these children, and fair in their youthful pride.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then there passed thro' the open doorway four maidens fair and bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They would know if they well had served him, and if soft lay the stranger knight.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Before each gentle maiden—Parzival, that hero fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang swift to his couch; then the maidens with gentle voice they spake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Sir Knight, we fain would pray thee for our sake awhile to wake'—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as children sport with each other had he hidden him from their sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet they might hear his greeting, yet their eyes had found swift delight,<span class="linenum">320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And their heart's desire was quickened at the sight of his red lips' glow<br></span>
<span class="i0">That for youth were as yet unhidden, for no hair did upon them grow.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now hear what they bare, these maidens, three in their hands so white<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought syrups sweet, and red wine, and the fourth, that maiden bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bare fruit that e'erwhile had ripened in the garden of Paradise    <span class="linenum">325</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On a cloth fair and white, and she knelt low before him that maiden wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade her sit, but she answered, 'Nay, Sir Knight, so is it best<br></span>
<span class="i0">For else were I sure unworthy to serve such a gallant guest.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he drank and would eat a little, and he spake to them soft and sweet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he laid him adown, and the maidens craved leave of him as was meet.<span class="linenum">330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then down on the costly carpet the squires set the tapers bright<br></span>
<span class="i0">When they saw that he slept, and swiftly they gat from the gallant knight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet Parzival lay not lonely, for until the dawn of day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-sorrow would lie beside him, nor passed with the dawn away.<br></span>

<span class="i0">E'en so that the fair youth's vision out-weighed e'en his mother's need<br></span>

<span class="i0">So fearful his dream that, wakened, thirty times had he rather died.<span class="linenum">340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fear and unrest awoke him, and the sweat streamed from every limb;<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The daylight shone fair thro' the windows, yet no voice had called on him.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake, 'Where are now the pages, who stood before me of late?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall hand unto me my garments?' Then awhile would he patient wait<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till slumber again o'ercame him; none spake, none aloud would cry, <span class="linenum">345</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished the folk—When he wakened the noon-tide sun was high.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he sprang up, and lo! before him on the carpet his harness lay,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then he spake to himself, 'Now wherefore was this done? I these arms will take,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep I such anguish suffered, methinks that I surely wake      <span class="linenum">350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To-day to some task of knighthood—If mine host doth some foeman fear<br></span>

<span class="i0">Who of true heart this mantle lent me—If my service she think to take<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then I were for such service joyful; yet not for her sweet love's sake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For my wife hath a face as lovely as ever this castle's queen,     <span class="linenum">355</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Then he did e'en as seemed him fitting, and he armed himself for fight<br></span>
<span class="i0">From foot to head, and beside him he girded those swords of might.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then forth went the gallant hero, and his steed to the palace stair<br></span>

<span class="i0">To where he at eve dismounted when first he the castle found,      <span class="linenum">365</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">For thus spake a knight to his master, 'On a grassy plain I saw<br></span>

<span class="i0">For Arthur the noble monarch, the King of the Breton's land        <span class="linenum">785</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With a wondrous fair host of maidens his court holdeth nigh at hand;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks scarce a mile are they distant, nor shout of knights shall fail,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On either side Plimizöl's waters their camp lies adown the vale.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Duke in haste and gladness forth from his bath he stept—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would ye know how she fared, Jeschuté? No longer the lady wept,    <span class="linenum">790</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But she went, the fair and gentle, from her bath to her couch straightway,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And far fairer, I ween, her garments than she ware for many a day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And closely they clung together, the prince and the princess wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Love came to the aid of gladness, and joy here hath won the prize.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the maidens they clad their lady, but the knights their lord's armour brought,<span class="linenum">795</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And much had ye praised the vesture of Jeschuté, 'twas fairly wrought<br></span>
<span class="i0">And birds caught in snares they brought them, on their couch did they sit the twain,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they brought to the lovely lady a palfrey, so strong and fair,<br></span>

<span class="i0">His shield so marred and splintered, and he asked of the gracious maid<span class="linenum">820</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For whose sake he had ridden thither, and they showed him the lady's seat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kunnewaaré she was of Lalande, and her mien for a maid was meet.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, armed, he drew near unto them—King and queen bade him welcome fair,<br></span>

<span class="i0">To render to me such service as I from your hands would gain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I were dead to all truth and honour if I dealt with thee as a foe,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">If Orilus wrong hath done me, yet I wished unto thee no ill,<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Jeschuté and her husband, the twain, she took by the hand,<br></span>

ARTHUR</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Book VI.</span> tells how King Arthur sought for the Red Knight; and how
he took an oath of his heroes to refrain from fighting. Of the blood-stained
snow, and the love-trance of Parzival; and how, unknowing, he
overthrew Segramor, and took vengeance on Kay. How Gawain led
Parzival to the court of King Arthur; and how he was made a knight of
the Round Table. Of the coming of Kondrie, and Kingrimursel, and the
shaming of Parzival and Gawain. Of Parzival's wrath and despair, and
how he rode forth to seek the Grail. How the knights went forth to the
venture of Château Merveil; and how Gawain rode to Askalon; and of the
scattering of this goodly company.</p>

<span class="i0">Now perchance it were well I should tell ye, how, as this his folk did pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Karidöl and his kingdom, King Arthur had ridden away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the venture telleth, on his own and on stranger ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">For eight days long had they ridden, nor yet had the Red Knight found.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For in truth 'twas for him they were seeking, to honour his hand were fain,<span class="linenum">5</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From sorrow had he released them, who had erst Prince Ither slain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Klamidé the king, and Kingron, in a welcome hour had sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the court of the Breton Monarch: for on this was King Arthur bent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He would make him one of his circle, a knight of the Table Round,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No labour too great he counted, so the hero at last he found!       <span class="linenum">10</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus o'er mountain and vale they sought him—All who knightly shield might bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">King Arthur now called around him, and in this wise he bade them swear:<br></span>
<span class="i0">What deeds so e'er of knighthood they should see, by this their oath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They should on no conflict venture, but faithful still keep their troth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As they sware unto him, their monarch, and fight but as he thereto  <span class="linenum">15</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Should give them leave—He spake thus, 'Now, 'tis well! Since we needs must go<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' many a stranger country, where many a stranger spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a gallant hero are waiting us, I fear,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Much evil might there befall ye, and such chance should but please me ill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by this your oath, I think me, such rashness I best may still.<br></span>

<span class="i0">For whate'er men have sung or spoken of King Arthur, at Whitsuntide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or when May-blossoms deck the meadow, these marvels did aye betide. <span class="linenum">30</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">The falconers from Karidöl, as the shadows of evening fell,<br></span>

<span class="i0">For the best of their hawks flew from them, nor stooped to the lure again,<span class="linenum">35</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">A road unknown, sharp the frost stung, in the far east uprose the day,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Thro' the forest paths untrodden, in ever waxing light,             <span class="linenum">40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Rode our hero by hedge or thicket, by rock and by fallen tree,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till clear grew the shadowy woodland, and its depths he well might see,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a mighty tree of the forest had fallen where he would ride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(The falcon yet followed after) 'mid its clustering boughs he spied<br></span>
<span class="i0">A flock of wild-geese from the Northland, their hissing he first had heard,<span class="linenum">45</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift swooped the falcon upon them and struck to the earth a bird:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce might it fly the clutches of its foe, and fresh shelter take<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath the shade of the fallen branches; in its flight from the wounds there brake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three blood-drops, all glowing crimson, and fell on the spotless snow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Parzival's eyes beheld them, swift sorrow his heart must know!   <span class="linenum">50</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">He thought, 'Say what hand hath painted these colours that here I see?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kondwiramur, I think well, these tints sure shall liken thee!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And white snow and blood-drops crimson, do ever thy likeness share, <span class="linenum">55</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For this favour I praise God's working, and the world he hath wrought so fair!<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then her sweet face arose before him, in that night she first sought his side,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And so true was his love and steadfast, little recked he of aught around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But wrapped round in love and longing, saw naught but the blood-stained ground.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frau Minne with force constrained him, as here on his wife he thought,<span class="linenum">65</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">So held he him still, as sleeping—Would ye know who found him there?<br></span>
<span class="i0">The squire of fair Kunnewaaré would forth unto Lalande fare,<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>The poet will now for a while recount the adventures of Gawain;
whom many have held to be as valiant a knight as Parzival.</p>
<p>Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> tells how Gawain fell in with the army of King Meljanz of
Lys, who would fain avenge himself on Duke Lippaut, whose daughter had
scorned his love. How Gawain came to the beleaguered city of Beaurosch;
how Obie scorned him; and how Obilot besought him to be her knight.
How the heroes fought before the walls of Beaurosch, and of the valiant
deeds of Gawain and the Red Knight. How Gawain took Meljanz of
Lys captive; how Obilot made peace betwixt Obie and Meljanz, and how
Gawain rode forth from Beaurosch.</p>

<span class="i0">Awhile shall this venture follow the knight, who to fly was fain<br></span>
<span class="i0">From shame, nor with guile had dealings, that hero bold, Gawain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For many a one hath held him for as brave, yea, for braver knight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than Parzival, who the hero of this wonder-tale is hight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he who his friend would ever with his words to the heavens upraise<span class="linenum">5</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Is slow to speak well of another, or to yield him his meed of praise;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him shall the people follow whose praises with truth are wrought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else whatever he speak, or hath spoken, shall ne'er under roof be brought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall shelter the word of wisdom if wise men their aid withhold?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But a song that is woven of falsehood is best left in the outer cold,<span class="linenum">10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Homeless, upon the snowdrift, that the mouth may wax chill and sore<br></span>
<span class="i0">That hath spread for truth the story—such rewarding hath God in store<br></span>
<span class="i0">As all true folk must wish him whose guerdon in toil is told—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who is swift to such deeds, I wot me, but blame for reward shall hold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And if good men and true shall praise him, then folly doth rule their mind;<span class="linenum">15</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He will flee such who true shame knoweth, and in knighthood his rule would find.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And true of heart was Sir Gawain, for courage as sentinel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had guarded his fame, nor shadow of cowardice across it fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But his heart in the field of battle was strong as a mighty tower,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Steadfast in sharpest conflict, yet foremost in danger's hour.      <span class="linenum">20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And friend and foe bare witness to the fame of his battle-cry;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fain was Kingrimursel to rob him of his glory thus waxen high—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now far from the court of King Arthur for many a weary day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know not their tale to tell ye, did the valiant Gawain stray;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So rode he, the gallant hero, from out of a woodland shade,         <span class="linenum">25</span><br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And his folk they were close behind him as he wended adown the glade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there on a hill before him he was 'ware of a goodly sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">That would teach him fear, yet fresh courage it brought to the gallant knight.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the hero he saw full clearly how a host on their way would fare<br></span>
<span class="i0">With pomp of warlike pageant, and banners borne high in air.        <span class="linenum">30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then he thought, 'I too far have journeyed this host in the wood to wait'—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade them prepare the charger that was Orilus' gift of late,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And red were its ears, and Gringuljet, I think me, they called its name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without a prayer he won it—The steed from Monsalväsch came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lähelein, in a joust he took it, when lifeless its rider fell       <span class="linenum">35</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Lake of Brimbane—Hereafter Trevrezent would the story tell.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thought Gawain, 'He who cowardly flieth ere the foe on his track shall be<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flieth all too soon for his honour—this host would I nearer see<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever may then befall me; they have seen me ere this I trow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, for aught that may chance unto me, wit shall counsel me well enow.'<span class="linenum">40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then down he sprang from his charger as one who his goal hath found.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Countless I ween the army that in troops was toward him bound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw many robes fair fashioned, and shields with their blazon bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he knew them not, nor the banners that danced on the breezes light.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Strange shall I be to this army,' quoth Gawain, 'strange are they to me,<span class="linenum">45</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">If they count this to me for evil then a joust shall they surely see,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a spear will I break with these heroes ere yet on my way I ride!'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gringuljet too was ready when his master would strife abide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In many an hour of peril he the hero to joust had borne,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Gawain had well bethought him when the steed he would ride that morn.<span class="linenum">50</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Gawain saw many a helmet, costly and decked full fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And new spears white, unsplintered, in sheaves to their goal they bare;<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the pages hands were given those blazoned with colours clear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the badge might ye read on the pennons that floated from every spear.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the son of King Lot, Sir Gawain, he saw there a crowded throng, <span class="linenum">55</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There were mules with harness laden; heavy wagons with horses strong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they hasted them, fain for shelter; and behind them a wondrous store<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of goods, borne by travelling merchants as was ever the way of yore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And women were there in plenty, and of knightly girdle bright<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The twelfth might some wear, the payment and pledge of love holden light.<span class="linenum">60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Not <i>queens</i> were they hight, I think me, <i>Vivandierès</i> was their name—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And young and old behind them a rabble onward came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they ran till their limbs were weary; and a rope had fit guerdon been<br></span>
<span class="i0">For many who swelled this army, and dishonoured true folk I ween!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they rode, and they ran, that army, and Gawain stood beside the way,<span class="linenum">65</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So it chanced they who saw the hero deemed him part of their host that day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And never this side of the water, or in lands that beyond it lie,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So gallant a host had journeyed, great their strength and their courage high.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And close on their track there followed, spurring his steed amain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A squire of noble bearing, with a led horse beside his rein;        <span class="linenum">70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And a fair new shield he carried, and ever his spurs he plied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought to spare his charger, but swift to the strife would ride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his raiment was fairly fashioned—Then Gawain his pathway crossed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, greeting, he asked him tidings, who was lord of this goodly host?<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the squire, 'Sir Knight thou mockest, were I lacking in courtesy,<span class="linenum">75</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And have chastisement earned, then I pray thee that my penance shall other be<br></span>
<span class="i0">That shall wound not so sore mine honour—For God's sake lay thine hate aside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks thou right well shalt know them, these knights that before us ride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why askest thou me? Of a surety to each other shall ye be known<br></span>
<span class="i0">As well, nay, a thousand times better, than I unto thee had shown!' <span class="linenum">80</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then many an oath he sware him, he knew not the race or name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the folk who went there before him, 'My journey hath won but shame,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since in truth must I make confession that never before to-day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes have beheld these heroes, tho' mine aid men right oft would pray!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the squire he quoth unto Gawain, 'Sir Knight, <i>mine</i> the wrong hath been,<span class="linenum">85</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy question I should have answered, here my wisdom hath failed I ween!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now pass judgment on me, I pray thee, of thy friendly heart and true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter I'll gladly tell thee, first must I my folly rue.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Then, lad, by thy words of repentance, sure token of courtesy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The name of this gallant army I prithee to tell to me!'             <span class="linenum">90</span><br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Sir Knight, he who rides before us, and no man his way doth bar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is King Poidikonjonz; and beside him Duke Astor he rides to war,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lanveronz is he ruler—and there rideth beside the twain<br></span>
<span class="i0">One whose roughness and ways discourteous Love's payment have sought in vain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He beareth the brand unknightly, Meljakanz that prince is hight,    <span class="linenum">95</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He wooeth nor wife nor maiden, but their love will he take with might,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, methinks, men for that should slay him—Poidikonjonz' son is he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And here will he fight with his army, and he fighteth right valiantly,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dauntless his heart; but such manhood it profiteth naught, I trow—<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ye threaten, perchance, her sucklings, she fighteth, the mother sow!<span class="linenum">100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And never a voice shall praise him whose strength lacketh knighthood fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And methinks to the truth of my speaking many men will their witness bear.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now hearken to greater marvels, and mark thou the words I say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">One with a mighty army doth follow upon our way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom folly doth drive to battle—The young King Meljanz of Lys,    <span class="linenum">105</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Scorned love wrought in him fierce anger, and pride vexed him needlessly,'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And courteous he spake to Sir Gawain. 'What I saw, I Sir Knight will say:<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sire of the young King Meljanz, as he on his death-bed lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He bade them draw near unto him, the princes from out his land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his gallant life lay forfeit, a pledge in stern Death's cold hand,<span class="linenum">110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to Death he needs must yield him—In grief o'er his coming end<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the faith of the princes round him his son would the king commend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he chose out one from among them, the chief of his vassals true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his faith was proved and steadfast, and from false ways afar he flew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he gave the lad to his keeping, and he quoth, 'Now, with hand and heart,<span class="linenum">115</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">True service henceforward show him, bid him aye act a kingly part<br></span>
<span class="i0">To vassal alike and stranger; bid him list to the poor man's prayer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And freely give of his substance.' Thus he left him unto his care.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And Prince Lippaut did as his monarch, dying, of him did pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor failed in aught, but true service he did to his lord alway.    <span class="linenum">120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And he took the lad to his castle, and the prince had two children fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He loved them well, and I think me, e'en to-day they his love shall share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">One maiden in naught was lacking, save in age, that a knight might crave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her love for his love's rewarding; Obie was the name they gave<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To this maid; Obilot, her sister; and the elder maid, I ween,      <span class="linenum">125</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wrought ill, for she, and none other, the cause of this strife hath been.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'It so fell that one day the young king for his service reward would pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas an ill thought, she quoth, and she asked him why his wits he had cast away?<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake unto him, 'I think me, e'en if thou so old shouldst be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That 'neath shield thou the hours hadst counted that in worthy strife might flee;<span class="linenum">130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With helmet on head hadst mingled in knightly venture bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tale of thy days, if reckoned, full five years more had told;<br></span>
<span class="i0">If there thou hadst won thee honour, and hither hadst come again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed thyself to my bidding, if a <i>yea</i> I to speak were fain<br></span>
<span class="i0">To that which thou now desirest, all too soon should I grant thy prayer—<span class="linenum">135</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art dear, I will ne'er deny it, as Galoes to Annora fair;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For death did she seek, and I think me that her seeking was not in vain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When she lost him, her well belovèd, and her knight in a joust was slain.'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now sore doth it grieve me, Lady, that love worketh so in thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thine anger with words of scorning thus venteth itself on me. <span class="linenum">140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For true service,' quoth he, 'winneth favour, an love thus be well approved;<br></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-weening thy pride thus to taunt me that madness my speech had moved!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Small wisdom in this thou showest, 'twere better thou hadst bethought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How thy father is but my vassal, and save of my grace hath naught!'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For that which he holds can he serve thee,' she spake, 'higher is my aim,<span class="linenum">145</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For fief will I hold of no man, none shall me as vassal claim!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And so high do I prize my freedom that no crown it shall be too high,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That an earthly head e'er weareth!' Then he spake out wrathfully,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Methinks thou hast been well tutored, that thy pride shall have waxed so great,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An thy father such counsel gave thee, then penance on wrong shall wait—<span class="linenum">150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis meet that for this I arm me, some wounded shall be, some slain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An they call it or war, or Tourney, many spears shall they break in twain!'<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thus in anger he left the maiden, and all did his wrath bemoan,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, full sore it grieved the lady—Her father must well atone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' he sware as his lord reproached him, guiltless of wrong was he,<span class="linenum">155</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(Or straight were his ways or crooked, his peers should his judges be,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<span class="i0">All the princes in court assembled)—that he to this strait was brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' no sin of his own—And eager the prince from his lord besought<br></span>
<span class="i0">His favour and love as of old time, but in vain he for peace might pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For anger it ruled the monarch, and his gladness was reft away.'   <span class="linenum">160</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tho' hasty the prince they counselled a prisoner to make his lord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His host had he been, and such treason of a true knight were aye abhorred.<br></span>

<span class="i0">And his pages, the sons of princes, aloud in their sorrow cried.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time with the king they dwelt there, and goodwill they to Lippaut bare,<span class="linenum">165</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For in truth did he aye entreat them, nor failed them in knighthood fair.<br></span>

<span class="i0">And some shall be prince's children, and some not so highly born,<br></span>

<span class="i0">'Thus these two kings, moved by anger, will forth unto Beaurosch ride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where with toil he would win the favour that the maid to his love denied.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Yet so well is Beaurosch guarded that, tho' twenty hosts were here,<span class="linenum">180</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Then the squire he spake unto Gawain, 'Thy leave I, Sir Knight, would pray,'<br></span>

<span class="i0">Save see how this venture ended? Yet awhile he doubted sore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought, 'If I look on conflict, and fight not as aye of yore,<br></span>

<span class="i0">E'en tho' it may be for battle, then in sooth is it reft away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My meed of worldly honour—To fight not, methinks, were best,      <span class="linenum">195</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">First must I fulfil my challenge.' But afresh doubt vexed his breast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he deemed that his warlike errand but little might brook delay,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The crown of all other castles—Before it the army lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the plain 'neath the walls of the city; thro' the lines must he take his way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And right well he marked, Sir Gawain, many tents in a goodly ring, <span class="linenum">205</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">And strangers are oft unfriendly; As King Lot's son he passed them by<br></span>
<span class="i0">No man of them all bade him tarry, so he rode o'er the grassy plain,<span class="linenum">215</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Tho' little he knew the pathway to the Burg came the gallant knight,<br></span>

<span class="i0">So hearken, and do as I pray thee!' Then he bade them to lift the maid<span class="linenum">565</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">If I give him naught—Never hero truer love from a maid might claim!'<br></span>

<span class="i0">And she deems she of right may ask it, since a knight will her token bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he asketh her love, and he offers to do for her service fair.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then out spake the maiden's mother, 'Ah, good and gallant knight!<br></span>

<span class="i0">That therefrom for his little daughter fitting garments should straight be made.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the best would he grudge to the maiden, and they shaped her a garment fair,<br></span>

<span class="i0">This should Gawain win for his token and badge in the coming fray. <span class="linenum">600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So this was the gift that she gave him, a rich silk of Orient bright,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That was brought from the land of the paynim, and had covered her arm so white.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Whosoe'er at Beaurosch had battled, methinks that Gawain had won<br></span>
<span class="i0">The highest fame in both armies, save but for one knight alone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And none knew his red harness glowing, and none knew from whence he came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But high as a banner waveth, so high did it rise, his fame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet of honour alike and good fortune had Gawain in full his share—  <span class="linenum">5</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Now hence must he ride, for the moment of strife which he sought drew near,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And far and wide stretched the woodland thro' which he must wend his way—<br></span>
<span class="i0">No conflict he shunned, tho' all guiltless of the sin men on him would lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, alas! his charger failed him, Ingliart, with the close-cropped ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Moors at Tabronit no better the steeds they rear.<span class="linenum">10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And diverse the wood around him, here a bush and there a field,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And so narrow at whiles, that pathway, it scarcely a space might yield<br></span>
<span class="i0">For tent, or for knight's pavilion. Then fair dwellings met his eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Askalon, and he prayed them if Schamfanzon at hand did lie?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But many a marsh and moorland and many a steep hillside             <span class="linenum">15</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Must he traverse, ere fair before him in the setting sun he spied<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fortress stand so stately, it gleamed in the sunlight's rays,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he turned his steed towards it who rode here on unknown ways.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now list ye awhile the venture, and mourn ye awhile with me<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrow that fell on Gawain—And if old ye shall chance to be    <span class="linenum">20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or young, yet of this your friendship I pray you his grief to weep;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! were it best to tell ye, or silence a space to keep?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, better to tell the story, how he whom Good Luck did call<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her friend, was by her forsaken, and how grief to his lot must fall.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So proudly uprose the fortress that never did Carthage seem         <span class="linenum">25</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So fair to the eyes of Æneas, when Dido, as failed her dream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, turned to death and, seeking, found rest in his cold embrace.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would ye know what countless turrets those stately halls did grace?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce more had Akraton boasted, that city whose walls so wide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An man may believe the heathen, with Babylon only vied;             <span class="linenum">30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So high rose the circling ramparts, and where to the sea they fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">No storm might they fear, but defiance could they bid to their foes right well.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Fore the city a plain outstretching lay fair for a mile or more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Sir Gawain rode across it, five hundred knights he saw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one, o'er all the others, gallant and fair to sight;            <span class="linenum">35</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Gaily they rode towards him all clad in raiment bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For so the venture telleth—With their falcons soaring high<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would they chase the crane, or other fair game that should wingèd fly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tall steed from Spain's far kingdom, King Vergulacht bestrode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his glance was as day in the night-time—Aforetime his race abode<span class="linenum">40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where Mazadan reigned as monarch, by Fay Morgan's mystic mount,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And amid the roll of his fathers he many a fay might count—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And even as in the spring-tide the May blossom bloometh fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">So rode the king in his beauty, and Gawain he bethought him there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he saw him ride so stately, 'twas another Parzival,              <span class="linenum">45</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or Gamuret, as he came to Kanvoleis, as this venture erewhile did tell.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now into a pond so marshy a heron had taken flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">As it fled from before the falcon, and the king, as beseemed a knight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sought not for the ford but followed as he saw his falcon's need,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wet he won in the aiding, and lost was his gallant steed,       <span class="linenum">50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And lost too his royal raiment, tho' safe was I ween the bird.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The falconers took his garments, for this, so the tale I've heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was their right, and they needs must have them, and no man might say them nay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another horse they brought him, for lost was his own for aye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fresh garments they put upon him, since such was the chance of fate<span class="linenum">55</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That his falconers won the vesture that had decked their king of late.<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sir Gawain, he rode towards them, and knightly and worshipful<br></span>
<span class="i0">The greeting they gave unto him, not such as in Karidöl<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once fell to the lot of Erec, when after his well-fought fight<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had fain drawn near to King Arthur, and with him his lady bright,<span class="linenum">60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Enid, who graced his coming—But the dwarf Maliklisier<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a scourge full hardly smote him, 'neath the eyes of Queen Guinevere.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Tulmein he took his vengeance, where, within the ring so wide<br></span>
<span class="i0">To win the hawk, the heroes in deeds of valour vied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Idêr, the son of Noit, a hero true and bold                   <span class="linenum">65</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he else had slain, whom Erec did there in surety hold.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But leave we all other venture, and hearken awhile to me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For in sooth never fairer welcome shall it fall to your lot to see.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, alas! for ill it wrought him, Gawain, King Lot's brave son—<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ye will I will cease my story ere the tale to its end be run,    <span class="linenum">70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And for pity's sake keep silence—Yet perchance it were best to tell<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ill that thro' others' treason on a gallant spirit fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And if I yet further pray ye this story strange to heed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then in sooth, e'en as I, right truly will ye mourn for its hero's need.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the king, 'Sir Knight, thus I think me, thou shalt to the castle ride,<span class="linenum">75</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine <i>host</i> will I be right gladly, tho' scarce may I be thy <i>guide</i>;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet if this on my part shall vex thee the chase will I gladly leave!'<br></span>

<span class="i0">Whate'er thou shalt do shall be well done—No grudge do I bear thee, Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But of right good-will I gladly will do as thou shalt require.'     <span class="linenum">80</span><br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the king of Askalon further, 'Schamfanzon thou well mayst see<br></span>

<span class="i0">And she hath in fullest measure such beauty as poets sing—<br></span>

<span class="i0">Such word she shall well entreat thee in my stead, till I come again.<span class="linenum">85</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And whenever I come, I think me, 'twill be sooner than thou art fain<br></span>
<span class="i0">To look on my face, for gladly wilt thou spare me when thou shalt see<br></span>
<span class="i0">My sweet sister, nor e'er bemoan thee, tho' my coming o'er late shall be!'<br></span>

<span class="i0">Thus spake the gallant Gawain—Then a knight bare the king's behest<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his sister, that she, as fitting, should so care for the stranger guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">That however long his absence the hours should as minutes fly—<br></span>
<span class="i0">(An ye will, I will cease my story that now runneth but mournfully!)<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, further I'll tell the venture,—Steed and pathway the hero bore<span class="linenum">95</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where as one were both Burg and palace, and he held him before the door.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he who shall e'er have builded a house, he shall better know<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tell of this mighty castle, and the strength of its walls to show.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, indeed 'twas a Burg, none better might this earth on its bosom bear<br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leave we the praise of the castle, and speak of the castle's queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden fair, for of women I shall better speak I ween,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as fitting I'll sing her praises—Was she fair to the eye? 'Twas well;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was she true of heart? Then gladly will men of her praises tell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And so both in mind and manner might she vie with that lady true,  <span class="linenum">105</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Such pastime as there his portion he findeth not other-where!<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I praise but a woman's virtue, as I see, and shall surely know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">True and pure must she be, the maiden, on whom I shall praise bestow.<span class="linenum">110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And he whom this venture singeth is a gallant man and true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For no dealing have I with falsehood, or with one who his deeds shall rue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As repentance, slowly piercing, but turneth his bliss to bale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his soul knoweth wrath and sorrow, or ever his life-days fail.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the castle court rode Gawain, and the goodly company            <span class="linenum">115</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the king had sent him, who shamed for his sake should be.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the knight to his lady led him, as she sat in her beauty's glow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Antikonie—Could the merchants a woman's fame bestow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such goods had she made rich purchase; 'gainst falsehood she set her face,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ah! woe's me for him of Veldeck, that death thus cut short his days,<br></span>
<span class="i0">None is there of all men living who so well could have sung her praise.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain, he looked on the maiden, and the messenger spake the word<br></span>
<span class="i0">E'en as the king had bade him, and the queen his message heard.<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then gently she spake to the hero, 'Come thou near unto me, Sir Knight,<span class="linenum">125</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">No stranger sure had kissed her as kissed this stranger guest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked he sat him by her, and sweet words passed between,       <span class="linenum">135</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Soft spake they to each other; and oft renewed, I ween,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His prayers and her denials, yea, sorely grieved was he,<br></span>

<span class="i0">In the fear for her guest's well-doing that lay dark on the maiden's heart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So the twain with the queen abode there till the strife of the day was o'er,<span class="linenum">435</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the night and the hour of feasting had come in their course once more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the slender maidens bare them sweet drinks, and the wine so red,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with fish and fowl in plenty, I ween, was the table spread.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Yea, fair with the opening beauty of the rose that is yet unblown, <span class="linenum">445</span><br></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">For a knight, who o'er great my fame deemed, in joust smote me such a blow<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, behind my gallant charger, on the greensward he laid me low.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Right well did the counsel please them, and ended, I ween, the strife,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then the queen led Gawain to her brother with slender hand and white,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Eight lads, all of noble bearing and birth, with Gawain did ride.<br></span>

<span class="i0">What payment gave he? Meed of honour their guerdon, and tender care!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain quoth unto the children, ''Tis well, for I now have seen,<br></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Meantime had his squires bethought them, and his steed to the palace brought,<span class="linenum">585</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where the boughs of a mighty linden might shadow the outer court;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Landgrave's folk they sought him, and together they took their way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without the walls; ere they parted this grace would Sir Gawain pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since his squires might no more fare with him, that the Landgrave with them in ward<br></span>

<span class="i0">Short the space ere both steed and rider were clad in their mail of might,<span class="linenum">595</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Kinsmen and squires, he kissed them, and alone rode that gallant knight,<br></span>

TREVREZENT</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> In the opening the spirit of adventure craves admission to
the heart of the poet, who would fain learn from her tidings of Parzival.
The venture telleth how the hero had ridden long in doubt and despair,
and knew not the days of his wanderings. How he met again with Siguné
and came to the forest of Monsalväsch, where he fought with a Knight of
the Grail. How, on Good Friday, Parzival met with a pilgrim knight who
reproached him for bearing arms at that Holy Tide, and bade him seek
the hermit Trevrezent.</p>
<p>How Parzival came to the hermit's cell, and spake of his wrath against
God, of his sorrow for his wife, and of his search for the Grail. How
Trevrezent told him wherein he had sinned, and showed him the way of
salvation.</p>
<p>How the hermit farther revealed to him the mysteries of the Grail, of the
Bleeding Lance, and the knives of silver; how he told him of the wound
of Anfortas, of the race of the Grail Kings, and how Parzival himself was
nephew to Anfortas and Trevrezent. How Parzival confessed that it was
he who came to the Grail Castle and failed to ask the question; how
Trevrezent spake to him words of comfort and counsel, and absolved him
from his sin; and how the two parted in sorrow.</p>

<h2>APPENDICES</h2>
<h3>APPENDIX A<br>

THE ANGEVIN ALLUSIONS OF THE 'PARZIVAL'</h3>
<p>One of the most striking peculiarities of this version of the Perceval legend consists
in the fact that the writer closely connects his hero with a contemporary princely
house, and exercises considerable ingenuity in constructing a genealogy which shall
establish a relationship alike with the legendary British race of Pendragon, and with
the hereditary House of Anjou. Now, that Parzival should be represented as connected
with Arthur is not surprising, taking into consideration the great popularity of
the Arthurian legends; the English 'Sir Percyvelle' makes the relationship even
closer; there, Percyvelle is Arthur's nephew, his sister's son; but it is far more difficult
to account for the Angevin connection. It has been suggested that the writer of
Wolfram's French source was Walter Mapes, to whom another of the Grail romances
the <i>Queste</i> is generally ascribed; and who, as is well known, was closely attached
to the Court of Henry Fitz-Empress, Count of Anjou, and King of England. Setting
on one side the great difference, in style and treatment, between the <i>Parzival</i> and
the <i>Queste</i>, which render it impossible to believe that the same man could have
treated the same legend from two such practically opposite points of view, a close
examination of the Angevin allusions found in the <i>Parzival</i> reveals a correspondence
between the characters and incidents of the poem, and the facts, real and traditional,
of Angevin history, which seems to point to a familiarity with the subject scarcely
likely to be possessed by a foreigner.</p>
<p>The following parallels will show that this Angevin element, though strongest in the
first two books (those peculiar to Wolfram's version), is to be clearly traced even in
the presentment of what we know to be traditional features of the story.</p>

It was to the influence of this ancestress that the uncontrollable temper of the Angevin princes was ascribed.

In 1129, after the marriage of his son, Geoffrey, with the Empress Maud, Fulk was invited by Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, to become his son-in-law and successor. Accordingly he resigned Anjou to Geoffrey, went to Jerusalem, where he married Melesinda, daughter and heiress to Baldwin, and, after the death of the latter, succeeded him as king, and reigned till his death in 1142. (Here again we note that, in each instance, the Eastern kingdom is won through the wife.)</td>

An <i>English</i> writer (such as Mapes) would probably have overlooked the part played by Theobald. An <i>Angevin</i>, knowing the Counts of Blois to be the hereditary foes of the House of Anjou, would hardly fail to record the fact that both brothers were concerned in the usurpation of the rights of Henry Fitz-Empress.</td>

<p>The peculiar presentment of the Knights of the Grail as Templars (Templeisen),
having their residence in a castle surrounded by a forest, recalls the fact that a close
connection between the Order of Templars and the House of Anjou had existed for
some time previous to the date of this poem, a tax for the benefit of the Order
having been imposed on all his dominions by Fulk <span class="smcap">V.</span> on his return from his first
pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1120. A community of Knights Templars was founded
by Henry Fitz-Empress fifty years later at Vaubourg, in the forest of Roumare which
became very famous. (The location of Monsalväsch in the Pyrenees hardly seems to
accord with the indications of the poem, which make it only thirty-six hours' ride
from Nantes.)</p>
<p>Finally, the name of the poet claimed by Wolfram as his authority, Kiot=Guiot=Guy,
is distinctly Angevin, the hereditary Angevin princely names being Fulk,
Geoffrey, and Guy.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B<br>

THE PROPER NAMES IN 'PARZIVAL'</h3>
<p>One of the marked peculiarities of Wolfram's poem is the number of proper names
with which it abounds, there being scarcely a character, however insignificant the rôle
assigned, that is left unnamed. In the other versions of the Perceval legend this is
not the case, consequently there are a vast number of names occurring in the <i>Parzival</i>
to which no parallel can be found elsewhere, and which are no unimportant factor in
determining the problem of the source from which Wolfram drew his poem. It
would be impossible in a short Appendix to discuss the question in all its bearings, but
the following classification, based on Herr Bartsch's article on <i>Die Eigen-namen in</i>
<i>Wolfram's Parzival</i>, will give some idea of the wide ground they cover:—</p>
<p>I. Names belonging to the original legend, and met with, with but little variation,
in all versions. To this class belong the names of Pendragon, Arthur, Guinivere,
Perceval, Gawain, Kay, Segramor; and the names of such places as Karidöl=Carduel=Carlisle,
Cumberland, Waleis, Norgals, Dianasdron.</p>
<p>II. Names derived from a French version of the story, which may be divided into
two classes:</p>
<div class="hangindent">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Names of which we find an equivalent in existing French sources, notably
Chrêtien, whose poem offers so close a parallel to the <i>Parzival</i>; examples of
this class are Gurnemanz=French, <i>Gornemant</i>; Peirapär=<i>Beau-repaire</i>;
Klamidé=<i>Clamadex</i>; Kingron=<i>Aguigrenon</i>; Trebuchet; Meljanz de Lys;
Lippaut=<i>Tiebaut</i>; Gramoflanz=<i>Guiromelans</i> or <i>Guiremelanz</i>.</p>
<p>(b) Names formed by a misunderstanding of a French original: such are Soltane,
from forest <i>soutaine</i>=solitary; Orilus de Lalande, from <i>Li orgueillous de la</i>
<i>lande</i>; and similarly, Orgeluse of Logrois, from <i>La orguelleuse de Logres</i>;
Gringuljet, the name of Gawain's horse, from <i>Li gringalet</i>, which is explained
as meaning <i>cheval maigre et alerte</i>. Ligweiz-prelljus, is <i>Li guez perellous</i>, the
Ford Perilous; and a notable instance of this class is the curious name
Schionatulander, which is either '<i>Li joenet de la lande</i>,' 'The youth of the
meadow,' or '<i>Li joenet à l'alant</i>,' 'The youth with the dog,' in allusion to the
cause of the knight's death. Whence Wolfram took this name is unknown.</p></div>
<p>III. Names borrowed or quoted from other romances of the time, of those to
which Wolfram alludes most frequently we know the <i>Erec</i> and <i>Iwein</i> of Hartmann
von Aue; Eilhart's <i>Tristan</i>; Heinrich von Veldeck's <i>Æneid</i>, Chrêtien de Troye's
<i>Cligès</i>, and <i>Le Chevalier de la Charrette</i>; and the <i>Niebelungenlied</i> and <i>Dietrich Sage</i>.
He also refers to other romances which have not come down to us, such are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
allusions to adventures connected with Gawain in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>; and to the death of
Ilinot, son of King Arthur, of whom we know nothing. (The names derived from
these romances are all noted, and their source given as they occur in the text.) Book
<span class="smcap">I.</span> contains some distinctly German names, such as Eisenhart, Hernant, and Herlindè,
Friedebrand of Scotland and Heuteger, the source of these is doubtful, some occur in
the Gudrun cycle, but it seems probable that in both instances they were derived from
a common source, and, belonging as they do to a North Sea cycle, they may have
reached the poem either through a French or a German medium.</p>
<p>IV. Names of places and people connected with Wolfram himself, such as
Abenberg, Wildberg, Erfurt, the Count of Wertheim, Herman of Thuringia, etc.
These were, of course, introduced by Wolfram, and could not have existed in his
French source.</p>
<p>V. Classical and mythological names such as Antikonie=Antigone, Ekuba,
Secundilla, Plato and the Sibyls, Pythagoras, etc., Jupiter, Juno, Venus, Amor, Cupid,
Lucifer, Ashtaroth, and other of the fallen angels.</p>
<p>VI. Oriental names. In Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> we have the Arabic names of the seven planets,
a curious coincidence, in view of the alleged Arabic source of the Grail-myth as given
in Books <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and <span class="smcap">IX.</span> Names of cities such as Alexandria, Bagdad, Askalon. This
latter is of course equivalent to <i>Escavalon</i> in the French versions, and the real name is
doubtless Avalon, but it is by no means improbable that the change was made not by
a misunderstanding, but by one who knew the Eastern city, and it falls in with the
various other indications of crusading influence to be traced throughout the poem.
We may add to these the names of Oriental materials such as Pfellel and Sendal.
But when all these have been classified, there still remains a vast number of names
undoubtedly French in origin, yet which cannot be referred to any known source, and
many of which bear distinct traces of Romance or Provençal influence. Such names
are Anfortas, French, <i>enfertez</i>=the sick man, with Prov. ending <i>as</i>; Trevrezent, Prov.
<i>Treu</i>=peace, <i>rezems</i>=redeemed. Schoysiane, Prov. <i>Jauziana</i>, her husband is Kiot
of Katelangen, <i>Guiot</i>=<i>Guy</i> of <i>Catalonia</i>. The son of Gurnemanz, Schenteflur, is
Prov. <i>gente-flors</i>, fair flower. The name of Parzival's wife, Kondwiramur, Bartsch
derives from <i>Coin de voire amour</i>, Ideal of true love; an interpretation which
admirably expresses the union between the two. Itonjè, Gawain's sister, is the French
<i>Idonie</i>, in Chrêtien she is Clarissant. The knight slain by Lähelein at Brimbane is
Libbèals of Prienlaskors, Libbèals being simply the old French <i>Li-beals</i>—<i>le bel</i>, and
probably no more a proper name than Orilus, whilst his country seems derived from
Prov. <i>priendre las cortz</i>, to seek the court. The long lists of conquered kings given in
Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> contain many names of Greek or Latin origin, which have passed through
a French source, and many others of distinctly Romance form. It is impossible to
suppose that a German poet <i>invented</i> these names, and the only reasonable explanation
seems to be that Wolfram drew largely, if not exclusively, from a French poem
now lost, and that the language in which that poem was written partook strongly of a
Provençal character, the term Provençal being applied, as Bartsch points out, not only
to Provençal proper, but to the varying forms of the Langue-d'oc.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p class="ph2">NOTES</p>
<p class="center">(<i>A few Notes signed A. N. are due to Mr. Alfred Nutt.</i>)
</p>
<h3>BOOK I</h3>
<p>Introduction, lines 1-66. This introduction, which is confessedly obscure, both in
style and thought, appears to have been written <i>after</i> the completion of the poem, and to
have been intended by the writer to serve both as a key to the meaning of the poem, and
as a defence of his method of treatment. That Wolfram was blamed by his contemporaries,
notably by Gottfried von Strassbourg, for his lack of a polished style, and
obscurity of thought, we know; and in <i>Willehalm</i> he speaks, in the following words, of the
varying judgment passed upon his <i>Parzival</i>:—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Swaz ich von Parzivâl gesprach,<br></span>
<span class="i0">des sîn aventiur mich wîste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">etzlich man daz prîste:<br></span>
<span class="i0">ir was ouch vil, diez smœthen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Und baz ir rede wæhten.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>and it is evidently to these critics that the first part of the Introduction is addressed.</p>
<p>Lines 1-8 give the key to the whole poem: the contrast between doubt or unsteadfastness,
and steadfast faith and truth, as imaged in the contrast between darkness and light,
black and white. This idea runs throughout the poem, is worked out symbolically in the
character and experiences of the hero, and is shown in a concrete form in the person of his
brother Feirefis. The poet notes that many readers have failed, through lack of intelligence,
to grasp the meaning of this parable, which is too swift and subtle for their comprehension.
A parallel passage will be found in Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> pp. 137, 138, where the figure
employed is different.</p>
<p>The curious lines 15, 16 are explained by Bötticher as allusions to <i>personal</i> assaults
made on the poet, which, by reason of the folly of the assailants, missed their mark, and
are therefore to be treated with contempt.</p>
<p>Lines 29, 30 contain one of the quaint and homely similes which abound throughout
the poem, and refer to the faithless man, <i>valsch geselleclîcher muot</i>, whose honour and
steadfastness are not sufficiently strong to meet the demands made upon them.</p>
<p>There are three distinct divisions of the Introduction: the first, lines 1-30, is addressed
to <i>men</i> only, and draws the contrast between the false and true knight; 31-49 does the
same for <i>women</i>; while from 49 onwards the poet shows how the tale he is about to tell
affects both sexes alike, and gives a slight sketch of the character of the hero. For the
rightful understanding of this the lines 61, 62 are of great importance: 'a brave man, yet
slowly wise Is he whom I hail my hero' (<i>er küene, trâctîche wîs, den helt ich alsus grüene</i>),
and should be borne in mind by the student of the poem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>A full and minute discussion of this discussion of this Introduction will be found in Dr. Bötticher's <i>Das</i>
<i>Hohelied von Rittertum</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_5" class="pginternal">5</a>, line 67—'<i>Now they do to-day as of old-time</i>.' The word employed here <i>wälsch</i>
simply means 'foreign,' but it is evident from the context that France is the country referred
to. The <i>fact</i> was probably in the French source, the remarks upon it due to the German poet.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_5" class="pginternal">5</a>. line 80—'<i>Gamuret</i>.' The origin of this name is doubtful; in Chrêtien we find
a King Ban de Gomeret mentioned, and Wolfram may have derived the name from a
French source, Heinmel suggests that it comes from Gamor, the son of Anguis, a Saracen
prince ruling in Denmark, according to 'Arthur and Merlin;' and that the fact of his
being of the race of Anguis suggested to Kiot the possibility of making him an Angevin.
In the absence of any definite knowledge as to Wolfram's source it is not possible to
do more than <i>suggest</i> possible derivations.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_7" class="pginternal">7</a>, lines 136, 137—'<i>Gylstram and Rankulat</i>.' With regard to the first-named
place, Simrock says it has been identified with 'Gustrate' in the <i>Gudrun</i>, and, according
to Grimm, this latter is to be coupled with Gailate, 'where the sun hath its setting.' <i>i.e.</i> the
West. In Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span> the patriarch of Rankulat is referred to, in company with the Baruch
of Bagdad and the Emperor of Constantinople, and in all probability Armenia is meant.
The king's speech therefore implies, 'Didst thou come from the furthest bounds of the
earth, East or West.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_8" class="pginternal">8</a>, line 154—'<i>King Gandein's son</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 285, where the origin of the
name Gandein is given.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_8" class="pginternal">8</a>, lines 159, 160.—'<i>Then the tale it hath told a lie</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 259.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_8" class="pginternal">8</a>, lines 169, 170—'<i>Rich silk of Orient</i>' Eastern materials are referred to frequently
throughout the poem; the principal seem to have been, Samite, Sendal, Achmardi, Pfellel,
Plialt, and Saranthasme. Of these, some were of silk only, others, notably Saranthasme
of silk inwoven with gold, Achmardi, in this poem, is always <i>green</i>. Samite and Sendal
are the two generally named in our English romances.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_9" class="pginternal">9</a>, line 209—'<i>Two brothers of Babylon</i>.' This is Babylon in Egypt, now Cairo,
as is evident from its close connection with Alexandria, cf. p. 12, line 277, and Book <span class="smcap">II.</span>
p. 57, line 684, and p. 59, line 754. Though, from the passage on p. <a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">57</a>, it seems as if the
poet confused it with Babylon in Assyria; it is possible that he was unaware of the fact
that there were <i>two</i> cities of the name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_15" class="pginternal">15</a>, line 384—'<i>Friedebrand</i>.' The introduction of names of distinctly northern
origin such as Friedebrand, Hernant, and Herlindè, Heuteger, and Eisenhart, has been
already noted in Appendix B as one of the problems of the <i>Parzival</i>. Two solutions
have been suggested, either that they were introduced by Wolfram, or that they reached
the <i>French</i> source through the medium of Normandy. The form in which the names
occur in the <i>Gudrun</i> cycle seems to indicate quotation from a source known also to
the writer of the <i>Parzival</i>, but they are not derived directly from the North Sea saga in
its present form.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_16" class="pginternal">16</a>, line 403—'<i>Wouldst thou know?</i>' <i>etc.</i> It may be interesting to note here that
beyond the <i>colour</i>, which the poet insists on, he apparently recognises no difference
between the heathen and Christian knights and ladies. Both acknowledge the same
chivalrous ideals; both are equally familiar with the eccentricities of 'Minne-dienst' (cf.
line 423); and the speeches put into the mouth of Belakané, or of Rassalig, would be
quite as suitable if spoken by Orgeluse, or by one of King Arthur's knights. This incident
of a Christian knight marrying a Moorish princess is of frequent occurrence in
Mediæval romance.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_16" class="pginternal">16</a>, lines 423, 424—'<i>That which like to a hall doth stand</i>.' The tents of the Mediæval
period were constructed of far more costly fabrics than is usual now, cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 74.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
and Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, and their size was very great, this special tent we find, from Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 36,
was 'thirty pack-steeds' burden.' San Marte quotes the description of a tent captured by
the Crusaders at Antioch which was adorned with walls, towers, and ramparts, contained
halls and galleries, and could lodge as many as 2000 men.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_22" class="pginternal">22</a>, line 620—'<i>The chiming of sweet bells</i>.' Bells were at one time freely used
not only as ornaments to the trappings of the horses but also on the armour of the knights,
cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 70, and Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 163. Gradually they disappeared from use, and the
bells on the Fool's dress are the last trace left of the practice, which from this poem was
evidently very general at the beginning of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_23" class="pginternal">23</a>, line 623—'<i>Brave Beaucorps</i>.' This brother of Gawain appears in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>
p. 183, he is the only one of Gawain's brothers mentioned in this poem. In Malory, we
find <i>Gareth</i> called 'Beau-mains,' and it is possible that the two are identical. Beaucorps
is evidently much younger than Gawain, and Gareth was the youngest of King Lot's sons.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_24" class="pginternal">24</a>, line 679—'<i>Lahfilirost</i>.' This seems to be a misunderstanding for '<i>Le fils du</i>
<i>Rost</i>,' and may be classed with the misinterpretations of a French source.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_25" class="pginternal">25</a>, line 700—'<i>Frau Minne</i>.' The word <i>Minne</i> is etymologically derivable
from a root 'man,' and is connected with the Latin <i>mens</i>, English 'mind' (cf. 'to have
a mind to.') The original signification was that of tender care, or thought for; in Old
High German it has already taken the meaning of love in its passionate aspects; finally,
in Middle High German (the original language of the <i>Parzival</i>), it has become the standing
expression for love betwixt man and woman. We have it in various forms as a verb,
<i>Minnen</i>; as an adjective, <i>Minniglich</i>. The personification of the passion of Love as
'Frau Minne' is the work of the courtly poets of the twelfth century, and seems rather
to have been derived from classical analogy than to be due to a reminiscence of an early
German goddess of Love. Also, with Wolfram and his contemporaries, 'Frau Minne'
must be regarded less as the personification of Love in the abstract than as the embodiment
of the special love-ideal of the day. This new ideal had its rise, and assumed
definite shape in twelfth century France, from whence it spread throughout the knightly
society of Christendom, finding its fullest literary expression in the Arthurian romances.
The historic causes which led to what was at the time an entirely novel mode of considering
the relations between the sexes, and the true nature and ethical import of the chivalric
conception of that relation will be briefly discussed in an Appendix to vol. II. The
significance of the term is fully apparent from such passages as the present, also cf.
Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> pp. 161, 163, 165, 171; <span class="smcap">VII.</span> 208, 224; <span class="smcap">XII.</span> etc.—[A. N.]</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_27" class="pginternal">27</a>, line 768.—'<i>Morhold</i>,' also in Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39. This is, of course, the well-known
hero in <i>Tristan</i>. The allusion may have been in the original French source, or
introduced by Wolfram, who would know Morhold from the Tristan of Eilhart von
Oberge, composed before 1180. The most famous German poem on the subject, the Tristan
of Gottfried von Strassbourg, was somewhat later in date.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_31" class="pginternal">31</a>, lines 886, 887—Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 230 and note.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_31" class="pginternal">31</a>, line 904—'<i>Feirefis</i>.' Bartsch interprets the name as <i>vair fils</i>, 'parti-coloured
son.' Other critics have suggested 'Fairy's son.' The name distinctly indicates a French
origin.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_31" class="pginternal">31</a>, line 905—'<i>A woodland-waster</i>,' 'wald-verschwender,' a hyperbolical term
constantly employed throughout this poem to denote one who shatters many spears in
fight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<h3>BOOK II</h3>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_35" class="pginternal">35</a>, line 16, and page <a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">57</a>, line 705—'<i>Waleis and Norgals</i>.' These, the two kingdoms
of Queen Herzeleide, are located by Wolfram in Spain, but they are undoubtedly
Wales and North Wales (the North galis of Malory), the Northern border-land. Parzival's
title throughout the poem is <i>der Waleis</i>, in French versions <i>le Gallois</i>, an evident indication
of the Celtic origin of the story.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_39" class="pginternal">39</a>, lines 117-160. Of the heroes taking part in the Tourney, Uther Pendragon
has been mentioned, in Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 31, in the genealogy of Gamuret. The poet carefully
connects his hero with the traditional royal race of Briton as well as with the princely
House of Anjou. Arthur's mother, Arnivè (not Igraine as in most versions), plays a somewhat
important rôle in the later part of the poem, her imprisonment in the castle of the
Magician Klingsor is fully treated of, cf. from Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span> onwards. King Lot of Norway
(not of Orkney as in the English legend) is frequently alluded to as Gawain's father, but both
he and Uther Pendragon are dead before the real action of the poem commences. This
is the first appearance of Gawain, who, from Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> onward, plays a part in the poem
scarcely inferior to that of the hero, Parzival. The Kings of Arragon and Gascony do not
appear again, nor are they alluded to, but Brandelidelein of Punturtois we meet with in
Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> as the uncle of King Gramoflanz. The King of Askalon must not be confused
with Vergulacht, in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, this is evidently one of his predecessors. Eidegast of
Logrois is frequently alluded to later on, his murder by Gramoflanz and the desire of his
lady-love, Orgeluse, to avenge him, form the <i>motif</i> of the later Gawain episodes. This is the
only occasion on which Lähelein appears personally in the poem, but he is constantly
alluded to throughout the course of the story (some remarks on the manner in which he is
introduced will be found in Appendix A, p. <a href="#Page_293" class="pginternal">293</a>). Morhold, cf. note to Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> Lambekein,
cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 152. Gurnemanz of Graharz plays an important rôle in the Parzival legend,
he is here introduced for the first time, cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span></p>
<p><i>The Tourney.</i> In this poem we find knightly skill in horsemanship and the use
of arms displayed under three distinct forms: the Buhurd, Books <span class="smcap">XII.</span> and <span class="smcap">XV.</span>, The
Tourney, Book <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and serious Warfare as in the siege of Pelrapär, Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, and of
Beaurosch, Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> The two first were simply intended as displays of knightly skill,
and took their rise in the knightly sports of the ninth century. The Buhurd seems to
have been the original German form, and at first was of a somewhat rough and uncivilised
character, the knights riding in bodies at full gallop against each other, and the
whole being a display of force rather than of skill.</p>
<p>The Tourney, or Tournament, took its rise in France, and here we find the knights, in
full armour, singly displaying their prowess. Gradually the Buhurd changed its character,
and throughout this poem we find Wolfram treating it as a formal display of skill in horsemanship,
generally to do honour to some favoured guest, as in the reception of Gawain
and Orgeluse by the knights of the Château Merveil, Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span>; in honour of Feirefis,
Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> Still the idea of force was not entirely eliminated, and we find Gawain, in Book
<span class="smcap">VII.</span> when he promises the child Obilot that he will fight for her father, telling her that
<i>she</i> must ride the Buhurd for him, and, as noted above, the fighting here is in earnest.
In the later form of Buhurd the knights wear no armour, and it is thus distinguished
from the Tourney, where they were always fully armed.</p>
<p>The Tourney was much more complicated in its rules, and is not always easy to distinguish
from the real warfare into which it not unfrequently passed. Feirefis, in Book
<span class="smcap">XV.</span>, mentions <i>five</i> modes of attack which seem to have answered to the regular stages of a
Tourney. Niedner explains them as follows: (1) An attack by one troop on another, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
lance in rest; (2) An attack from the side, also with lance; (3) The onslaught of <i>one</i> rider
on a troop of horsemen, in which the aim was to strike the one selected opponent while
avoiding the blows of the others; (4) The joust proper, or single combat; (5) The <i>Damenstick</i>,
a stroke for the honour of the knight's chosen lady, which followed on the joust, and
was specially challenged by knights of exceptional valour. In the Tourney at Kanvoleis
(the only Tourney proper in the poem), it is the two first stages in which Gamuret takes no
part, he only mingles in the fray when the time arrives to display the valour of the single
champions. The joust, or single combat, was a feature of earnest, as of mimic, warfare,
and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>In each case the great point was the display of skill in horsemanship, and the use of
the lance or spear. The knights rode at full speed towards each other, and the aim of
each was to strike his opponent in the centre of the shield, 'The four nails,' Book <span class="smcap">III.</span>
p. 98, or at the fastening of the helmet, Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 257, and Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> In either event if
the blow was well aimed, and delivered with sufficient force, the knight was thrown backward
off his steed. It might happen that both knights were struck, and succeeded in keeping
their seat, while their spears were shivered, then a second joust must be ridden. If either
knight were thrown from his saddle, or his steed fell with him, then he was held to be
vanquished, but if, as not unfrequently happened, the girth of the saddle broke, and the
rider were thrown, <i>then</i> the joust was held to be undecided, and, in the case of real warfare,
the issue was fought out with swords on foot. Cf. the combat between Parzival and
Klamidé, Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> pp. 119, 120. In Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> we find Parzival and Orilus fighting with
swords on horseback: this is unusual. In real warfare the knights would fight till one was
slain, or till the issue was indisputably decided by one being felled to the ground. We
occasionally find the combat decided by sheer strength of arm, one knight clasping the
other and throwing him to the ground; so Parzival conquers Orilus, Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 149, and
Gawain, Lischois, Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> Both in Tourney and real warfare the fight was generally
closed by the vanquished giving his pledge or surety to the victor, who not unfrequently
sent him to yield himself prisoner to some favoured lady, so Parzival sends Kingron,
Klamidé, and Orilus to Kunnewaaré. If the vanquished knight refused to yield he
would be slain, but this did not often happen. The death of Ither of Gaheviess is due to
a mischance. Armour and horse were the prize of the victor, though in the case of the foe
being slain it seems to have been thought an unknightly deed to take them, such 'robbery
of the dead' was termed <i>rêroup</i>, and Trevrezent, Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 273, strongly blames both
Lähelein and Parzival for such action.</p>
<p>The Tourney would often be held simply for honour, the prize being something comparatively
trifling, such as a hawk, cf. Tourney at Kanedig, alluded to in Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 77,
and again in Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 155, but occasionally the guerdon was far higher, as at Kanvoleis
where the band and kingdoms of Queen Herzeleide were the prize of the victor. Any
disputes would be referred to a court of judges from whose verdict there was no appeal.
In such Tourneys it was customary not to retain the horse and armour, but to accept a
ransom fixed by the <i>owner</i>. This is evidently alluded to in Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> 45, where we find
these rules disregarded in the heat of conflict.</p>
<p>Opposed to this Tourney 'for honour' was the Tourney 'for booty,' when the aim of the
knights was to capture as many steeds and make as many prisoners as possible, the ransom
being fixed by the <i>captor</i>. Wolfram does not mention such a Tourney, but with the decay
of knighthood such conflicts appear to have almost entirely displaced the nobler strife.
It will be understood, of course, that though a joust or single combat might either be
settled beforehand, as in the case of Kingrimursel's and Gramoflanz' challenge to Gawain,
or be brought about by a chance meeting, as when Vergulacht and the knight of Monsalväsch
fight with Parzival, a Tourney was carefully arranged beforehand, and the knights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
summoned by invitation. The knights generally assembled on the Saturday, and the
Tourney would be held on the Monday, the interval being employed in careful inquiry as
to the claim of those present to take a part in such knightly sport. The knights were
divided into two bodies of equal strength, headed by the most experienced warriors present,
and single champions would not unfrequently try their skill against each other on the eve
of the Tourney proper. Not unfrequently the passions of the knights were roused to such
a pitch that this <i>Vesper-spiel</i> became a serious encounter, and the combatants were so
exhausted that the Tourney could not be held, as was the case at Kanvoleis. From the
abuses connected with these meetings, which not unfrequently lapsed into serious warfare,
and caused wanton loss of life, they were looked upon with disfavour by the Church,
and in some cases were positively forbidden.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_42" class="pginternal">42</a>, line 236—'<i>Rivalein</i>,' according to Eilhart, the father of Tristan.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_44" class="pginternal">44</a>, line 279—'<i>I have named unto ye a lady</i>.' This is the queen of France, Anflisé,
whose connection with Gamuret is alluded to in Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 9. This episode was probably
suggested by facts in Angevin history, cf. Appendix. A reference to their connection will
be found in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 233.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_46" class="pginternal">46</a>, lines 351-60. Galoes the king of Anjou has not been named before. The
name occurs in Hartmann's <i>Erec</i>, and may have been borrowed from there. The
name of his lady-love is given in Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 199. The slayer of Galoes was Orilus,
Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 77.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_48" class="pginternal">48</a>, line 406—'<i>No wife was she but a maiden</i>.' Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 283, where a full
account of Herzeleide's marriage will be found, '<i>Herzeleide</i>.' The modern German
rendering of this name carries with it its own interpretation in the play of words
familiar through Wagner's <i>Parsifal</i>, 'Ihr brach das Leid das Herz und Herzeleide
starb.' But the original form, Herzeloyde, indicates, in Bartsch's opinion, a Southern
French modification, <i>loyde</i> being a variant of <i>hildis</i>, <i>oildis</i>. The name Rischoydè,
we know in its form of Richilda, and Herzeloyde seems to come from the same
root. Professor Rhys (<i>Arthurian Romance</i>, p. 180) has suggested derivation from the
Welsh <i>argelwythes</i> = 'the lady,' but the suggestion has not won general acceptance.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_54" class="pginternal">54</a>, line 614—'<i>The maid and her lands he won</i>.' Readers will doubtless remark
the fact that though we meet with numerous allusions to marriages and marriage festivities
throughout the poem, yet in no single instance is the marriage attended by a religious
ceremony. This is an indication of the original date of the story, which testifies to a very
early stage of social development. The original idea of marriage was that of a contract
made by mutual consent publicly before witnesses, as we find here in the marriages of
Gamuret with Belakané and Herzeleide, or later on in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, the marriage of Parzival
and Kondwiramur. The mutual promise being given and witnessed, the contract was
complete, and the marriage might be consummated at once. The office of the Church
seems at first to have been confined to conferring a benediction on a union already completed,
and therefore we find that, even so late as the thirteenth century, the religious ceremony
followed, and did not precede, the marriage night. San Marte, in his note on the subject,
quotes more than one romance of this date where this is the case, and it was not till the
idea of marriage as a sacrament had displaced that of marriage as a civil contract that the
religious ceremony became essential to a valid union. The fact that Wolfram, with his high
ideas of the binding nature of the marriage-vow, never once mentions the religious ceremony
is a strong argument in favour of the presumption that the subject-matter of the <i>Parzival</i>
is considerably older than his treatment of it. Marriage between a Christian and a
heathen was held to be null and void, and, according to the ideas of the age, Herzeleide
was fully within her rights in claiming Gamuret as her husband and in regarding his
previous marriage as non-existent. The costly presents made by the bridegroom, as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
instance the gift of Waleis and Norgals to Herzeleide by her first husband, seem to have
been a survival of the idea that the woman was property, to be bought by the intending
husband. The bride, on her part, gave equally rich gifts, so we find Kondwiramur
bestowing castles and lands on Parzival, and the mutual interchange of these gifts was an
essential part of the marriage contract.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_56" class="pginternal">56</a>, line 674—'<i>The panther</i>.' The badge of the House of Anjou was a leopard.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_59" class="pginternal">59</a>, lines 744, 745. The idea that a diamond might be softened by the application
of a he-goat's blood is very old. San Marte says it is mentioned by Pliny. Hartmann
refers to it in his <i>Erec</i>, and it seems to have been a general belief in the Middle Ages.</p>
<h3>BOOK III</h3>
<p>The first two books of this poem are peculiar to Wolfram. Among the different
versions of the Perceval legend which we possess there is a curious diversity of statement
as to the parentage of the hero; though, as a rule, they agree in the main facts of the death
of his father, either before, or shortly after, Perceval's birth, and his being brought up in
the desert by his widowed mother.</p>
<p>With the Third Book we find ourselves on ground common to most transcribers of the
legend; and in this and the following books a table of the traditional events contained in
the book, with the other versions of the story in which they occur, will be given. The
following are the Romances of the Grail-cycle which deal more particularly with the
Perceval legend.—</p>
<p><i>Li Conte del Graal</i>, poem by Chrêtien de Troyes; left unfinished at Chrêtien's death;
it was continued by three other writers; the poem as we have it, is the work of at least four
different hands.</p>
<p><i>Peredur</i>: Welsh tale found in the Red Book of Hergest.</p>
<p><i>Perceval</i>: A French prose romance, ascribed by many critics to Robert de Borron.</p>
<p><i>Sir Percyvelle of Galles</i>: English metrical romance—author unknown.</p>
<p><i>Perceval li Gallois</i>: French prose romance, also by an unknown writer.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>(It will be found that, from Books <span class="smcap">III.</span> to <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> inclusive, there is a very close parallelism
between Wolfram's poem and Chrêtien's share of <i>Li Conte del Graal</i>.)</p>
<p>Introduction, lines 1-45. This introduction, like that to Book <span class="smcap">I.</span>, appears to have
been written <i>after</i> the completion of the poem, and to have been intended by the poet as
a defence of his attitude towards women; certainly the lines 12-15 presuppose certain
statements which had aroused the wrath of the lady hearers of the poet. The whole
passage is interesting on account of its strongly personal character. In Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> Wolfram
refers more than once to the lady who has wronged him (pp. 163, 166, 191), and in terms
that show, as here, that he bitterly resented her treatment. The line 'Born was I unto
the bearing of knightly shield and spear,' is the only definite statement as to the poet's
rank in life which we possess, and in the light of his lasting fame as a poet it is curious
to find him holding his gift of song as of less account than his knightly deeds, which do
not seem to have been more remarkable than those of his fellows.</p>
<p>From Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 122, we learn that Wolfram was married, and, from the concluding
lines of Books <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, it is clear that the <i>Parzival</i> was composed with a view to
winning, or retaining, the favour of a lady, but the only direct personal allusion throughout
the entire poem is that to the Margravine of Heitstein in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 232, and the
passage is too vague to allow of our identifying the lady named either with Wolfram's
faithless love, or with her for whose sake he composed his poem; certainly the Margravine
was not his wife.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_67" class="pginternal">67</a>, line 61—'<i>Soltanè's strand</i>.' This is one of the many instances in the poem
in which an adjective has been taken as a proper name. In the French source it was
undoubtedly an adjective meaning 'solitary,' 'waste.' In Chrêtien we find <i>la gaste forest</i>
<i>soltaine</i>; other versions speak of the woods, or the desert, none but this gives a proper
name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_69" class="pginternal">69</a>, line 158—'<i>Ulterleg's Count</i>.' <i>Oultre-lac</i>, 'beyond the lake,' cf. Louis
D'outremer. This is again an instance of a qualifying term used as a proper name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_72" class="pginternal">72</a>, line 220—'<i>Meljakanz</i>.' This exploit is quite in keeping with the character of
the knight, cf. Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 198. In Malory we meet with the same character, as Sir
Meliagraunce; and the story of his abduction of Guinevere, and her rescue by Launcelot
is there given in full.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_72" class="pginternal">72</a>, line 240—'<i>For some cunning wile of woman</i>.' It is curious to note that
nothing comes of these elaborate precautions on the part of Herzeleide. Parzival's fool's
dress seems to excite very little attention, nothing is said of it on his appearance at
Arthur's court, nor do we hear of any one mocking him for it. The effect produced by
his personal beauty is much more strongly insisted upon. There is also a decided discrepancy
between the mother's anxiety to keep her son from danger and her suggestions
to him to avenge the wrong Lähelein has done him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_73" class="pginternal">73</a>, line 267—'<i>Lähelein</i>,' Cf. Appendix A, and remarks on this character.
Heinzel suggests that Lähelein=Llewellwyn, a prince of South Wales who conquered
North Wales in 1015. But if a parallel between the boyhood of Parzival and that of
Henry Fitz-Empress be intended, as seems probable, the Welsh connection is of too early
a date. The remarks in Heinzel's pamphlet, 'Ueber Wolfram von Eschenbach's <i>Parzival</i>,'
as to Lähelein being undoubtedly an historical personage, are worthy of note. It is
remarkable that we find no equivalent to this character in other versions of the story.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_74" class="pginternal">74</a>, line 287—'<i>Briziljan's wood</i>.' Most probably Broceliande, where so many
of the adventures of King Arthur and his knights take place. Undoubtedly this wood was
in Brittany, but the localities in the poem are much confused.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_74" class="pginternal">74</a>, line 297—'<i>Duke Orilus of Lalande</i>.' This name is again a misconception of
a French original, '<i>Li Orgueillous de-la-lande</i>,' which Wolfram has taken as a proper
name. In other versions the lady is unnamed. (It may be noted that Wolfram almost
invariably names his characters; and often goes to some trouble to connect them with
each other, and the main thread of his story. This tendency to account for everything,
<i>sum motiviren</i>, is a marked feature in Wolfram's writings.)</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_76" class="pginternal">76</a>, line 365—'<i>Thy brother, King Lac's son Erec</i>.' An allusion to the Erec of
Hartmann von Aue (founded upon Chrêtien's Erec and dealing with the same subject as
found in the Welsh tale of <i>Geraint</i> and the late Laureate's Enid) where the tournament at
Prurein is described.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_77" class="pginternal">77</a>, line 374—'<i>Proud Galoes</i>.' The slaying alike of Parzival's uncle Galoes, and
of his kinsman Schionatulander (p. <a href="#Page_80" class="pginternal">80</a>) by Orilus, Lähelein's brother, is also peculiar to
Wolfram, but it is curious that the <i>Rache-motif</i> thus introduced is not followed up, and
when Parzival overthrows Orilus it is to avenge the shaming of Jeschuté, nor, though
Orilus mentions his brother as having won <i>two</i> kingdoms, Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 150, does Parzival
connect the mention with the loss of his own heritage. This seems to indicate that the
special rôle assigned in this poem to the two brothers was not a part of the original story,
and has not been perfectly fitted into the framework.</p>
<p>The name of Orilus' wife, Jeschuté, is supposed to be derived from a misunderstanding,
Wolfram having interpreted the verb <i>gisoit</i>, lay, as a proper name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_77" class="pginternal">77</a>, line 375—'<i>The knight Plihopleheri</i>.' A knight of the Round Table mentioned
in Hartmann's <i>Iwein</i> (founded on Chrêtien's <i>Chevalier au Lyon</i>, the subject-matter
of which is the same as that of the Welsh <i>Lady of the Fountain</i>).</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_78" class="pginternal">78</a>, line 409—This shaming of Jeschuté will strongly recall to English readers the
story of <i>Enid and Geraint</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_79" class="pginternal">79</a>, line 437—'<i>Siguné and Schionatulander</i>.' The loves of these two are related
in Wolfram's unfinished poem of <i>Titurel</i>, where the full account of Schionatulander's fatal
chase of the hound, or brachet, is given. The adventure with the weeping damsel occurs
in other versions of the Perceval legend, but in none does she play so important a part as
in the <i>Parzival</i>, <i>vide</i> Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 141; Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 252; and Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> Her parentage
is given in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 274.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_79" class="pginternal">79</a>, line 466—'<i>Thou art Parzival</i>.' The interpretation here given of the hero's
name betrays clearly its French origin, <i>Perce-val</i>. In the Krône of Heinrich von Türlin
the writer explains <i>Val</i> as <i>Thal</i>=valley, or <i>Furch</i>=furrow. Wolfram seems to have understood
it in this second sense, and has given the name a symbolic meaning peculiar to himself.
In Chrêtien's poem no derivation or interpretation of the name is given, and the
hero himself guesses his name; nor do the special terms of endearment, evidently quoted
by Wolfram from a French source, occur in Chrêtien's version of the story.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_80" class="pginternal">80</a>, line 497—'<i>'Twas a churl</i>.' Wolfram's aristocratic contempt for peasants
may be noted in other passages, cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 43, and <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 219.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_81" class="pginternal">81</a>, line 517—'<i>Herr Hartmann von Aue</i>.' Hartmann von Aue was a famous
German poet of the twelfth century. If not absolutely the first to introduce the Arthurian
legends into Germany (Eilhart's <i>Tristan</i> is earlier than Hartmann's works), he was the
writer who first rendered them popular in that country. His principal poems are <i>Erec</i>,
written about 1191; and <i>Iwein</i> 1202, both of which are frequently referred to by
Wolfram. They were founded on two poems by Chrêtien de Troyes, <i>Erec</i> and <i>Le</i>
<i>Chevalier au Lyon</i>, but Hartmann was not a mere translator; he handled his materials
with considerable skill, and with an insight into the characters and motives of his
<i>dramatis personæ</i> which is distinctly a feature of the German presentment of these legends.
Enid and her mother Karnafite are characters in the <i>Erec</i>. The story of another of
Hartmann's poems, <i>Der arme Heinrich</i>, is well known to English readers through
Longfellow's version of it in <i>The Golden Legend</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_82" class="pginternal">82</a>, line 534—'<i>No Kurwenal was his teacher</i>.' Kurwenal is the friend and tutor
of Tristan. In Malory we find the name 'Gouvernail,' and it seems probable that here
again we have a term denoting an office converted into a proper name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_82" class="pginternal">82</a>, line 549—'<i>Ither of Gaheviess</i>.' Ither = Welsh <i>Idêr</i>; Gaheviess = <i>gas-vies</i>, old
wood. Chrêtien calls him '<i>de la forêt de Kinkerloi</i>.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_82" class="pginternal">82</a>, line 544—'<i>The Red Knight</i>.' This character is evidently one of the traditional
features of the story; though the circumstances of the meeting differ, there is no
version without its 'Red Knight.' In those romances of the Grail-cycle in which Perceval
has been deposed from his original position as hero in favour of Galahad, we find the
latter wearing the armour, and bearing the title, of the Red Knight. Here again Wolfram
is the only writer who names him, but it is somewhat startling to find the king of
<i>Cumberland</i> claiming <i>Brittany</i>. From Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> pp. 273 and 285, we learn that he was
Parzival's kinsman. It may be interesting here, and may help to the better understanding
of the poem, if we describe the armour of a knight at the end of the twelfth century. The
principal piece of defensive armour was the Hauberk (Halsberg), a coat formed of rings of
steel which reached to the knee, and had sleeves ending in iron gauntlets. Attached to
this, and forming one piece with the Halsberg, was the Härsenier, a cap of chain mail
which was drawn over the head below the helmet. The upper part of the face was protected
by the 'Nasen-band,' a band of iron provided with eye-holes; and the lower part
by the 'Fintäle,' a part of the 'Härsenier' which passed round and over the chin; above
this the helmet was fastened. (The use of the word 'visor' in the translation is an
anachronism, as the visor proper was not introduced till later, but there was no other word
which would express what was meant with equal brevity and clearness.) Foot and leg
were clad in hose of iron, and the knee and elbow were specially protected by plates of iron
or <i>schinnelier</i>. Over this harness many knights wore the <i>Waffen-rock</i>, a long sleeveless
garment of silk on which the badge of the knight was embroidered in gold and jewels.
The sword was girt above this garment. The knight would also bear his distinguishing
badge on helmet, shield, and the truncheon of his spear. The shield was of wood,
strengthened with bands of metal, and often decorated with precious stones, cf. the description
of Feirefis' shield in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> The shield was long-shaped, three-cornered, and was
held in the left hand close to the body, the spear was carried in the right, so that the horse
was guided by the <i>knee</i>, not by the <i>hand</i>, of the rider. The spear was a blade of steel, set
into a long heft of wood, or reed, <i>Röhr</i>, probably Bamboo, sometimes even the rough
trunk of a young tree, as in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 519. Shield and spear were alike painted in the
same colours as the robe of the knight, and the horse had a like covering of silk beneath
the saddle and over the coat of mail with which it was protected. The description
given by Wolfram of the arms and accoutrement of the Red Knight of Parzival, Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span>
p. 19, and Orilus, Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> pp. 147-148, <i>seq.</i>, will give a very clear idea of the appearance
of a knight in full battle-array.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_83" class="pginternal">83</a>, line 570—'<i>To the Table Round I came</i>.' Here we find an allusion to two
methods of laying claim to a property. There seems a difference of opinion as to the
first; Simrock holds that the pouring out of the wine constituted the claim; Bartsch,
that the point of the action lay in carrying off some part of the property claimed. This
seems the more probable interpretation, the pouring out of the wine then, as well as the
sprinkling the queen, would be accidental. In Chrêtien the indignation of king and queen
at the insult is far more strongly emphasised. The burning of a wisp of straw, as a
declaration of rights claimed, is mentioned by Grimm in his <i>Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_83" class="pginternal">83</a>, line 586—'<i>Iwanet</i>.' The diminutive of Iwein, the well-known hero of
Hartmann's poem (the Owain, son of Urien of Rheged, of Welsh tradition).</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_83" class="pginternal">83</a>—'<i>Parzival at the court of King Arthur</i>.' There are some distinctive
features in Wolfram's version of this incident. Parzival's behaviour towards the
King, though unconventional, is far less discourteous than that ascribed to him either
by Chrêtien or by the English 'Sir Percyvelle.' In Chrêtien's poem, Perceval rides into
the hall, where he finds the king and courtiers plunged in grief at the insult offered to them
by the Red Knight. The king does not reply to Perceval's greeting, and the lad rides so
close to him that his horse's head knocks off the king's cap. A reason for the failure of
the Knights of the Round Table to avenge the insult offered by the Red Knight is suggested
in the fact that they are already wounded in battle. [The student of Irish heroic
saga cannot fail to recall the strange disability under which the knights of Conchobor's court
suffered at times and which completely prostrated them. The province of Ulster would
have lain defenceless were it not that the Cuchulainn alone was free from the disability, and
single-handed defied the men of the rest of Ireland. There are many points of contrast
between the <i>enfances</i> of Cuchulainn and those of Perceval—A.N.] The kindly feeling
shown both by Arthur and Guinevere towards Ither is not paralleled in Chrêtien,
where the Red Knight is represented as Arthur's deadliest foe, and Guinevere is like to
die of shame and wrath at the insult offered to her. Chrêtien also places Perceval's
refusal to dismount here, whereas Wolfram places it on his arrival at Gurnemanz' castle.
In Chrêtien the hero tells the Red Knight of his intention to demand his armour from
Arthur, and there is no trace of the courteous and poetical greeting which Ither here
addresses to Parzival. The confusion of the Red Knight with the hero's own personal
foe is of course due to the introduction of the Lähelein episode which is peculiar to
Wolfram; but Chrêtien has a most curious passage connected with Perceval's inability to
disarm his dead antagonist:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ains auroie par carbonées<br></span>
<span class="i0">Trestout escarbelliè le mort,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Que nule des armes enport;'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>which as it stands is decidedly difficult of interpretation; while in the English Sir Percyvelle
we find the hero saying:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'My moder bad me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whenne my dart solde brokene be<br></span>
<span class="i0">Owte of the irene brenne the tree,'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>which evidently indicates the source of Chrêtien's curious remark. An examination of the
different versions seems to show that, while the German is the fuller and more poetical, the
French is here closer to the original form of the story.</p>
<p>Pages <a href="#Page_85" class="pginternal">85</a> and <a href="#Page_86" class="pginternal">86</a>, lines 635, 658—'<i>Kay the Seneschal</i>.' The character of Kay is one of
the problems of the Arthurian legends. In all the tales he is represented as filling the
office of Seneschal, and in all he is represented as a man of rough manners, violent temper,
and bitter tongue. The Seneschal (<i>Senes-schalh</i>), the oldest servant, was master of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
ceremonies, one of the chief personages of a royal household, and not unfrequently the
trusted confidant of the king; but such a chastisement as Kay here, and in other versions,
inflicts upon Kunnewaaré, was distinctly <i>outside</i> his office, and, taking into consideration
the standing of Kunnewaaré and Antanor, quite inconceivable. Here, as in other
instances, we have traces of an original tradition dating from a time when a far rougher
code of manners and customs obtained. Wolfram, while adhering closely to his source,
and to the traditional representation of Kay's character, was evidently extremely puzzled
by the undignified and discourteous part allotted to him, and in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> (p. 169) he
diverges from the story in order to explain what he feels to be a difficulty, and to defend
Kay at some length. The Northern French poets apparently felt the same, and as Kay
is generally represented as Arthur's foster-brother they invented the fable that the
unknightly traits in his character were due to his having been committed to the care of
a peasant nurse when his mother took charge of the infant Arthur.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_85" class="pginternal">85</a>, line 652—'<i>The maiden Kunnewaaré</i>.' The 'laughing damsel' seems to be
an archaic and misunderstood element in the Grail romances. A common incident of
folk-tales is for the hero, fool, lout, or tatterdemalion, to win to wife a princess who has
not laughed or spoken for years by inducing her to do either of these things. Some such
incident has apparently been woven into an heroic romance, the main outlines of which
were already fixed, so that the actual conclusion, marriage of the hero with the laughing
damsel, has been disturbed. Note, however, the homage paid by Parzival to Kunnewaaré,
and her evident affection for him (Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> pp. 181-185). Her name too is suggestive,
it has been derived from <i>la pucele a la gonne vaire</i> (the maiden with the coloured
robe), but in its present form it is suspiciously like Kondwiramur, and it should be noted
that it is the rejected lover of this queen whom Kunnewaaré eventually marries. Is it
possible that the Perceval romance from which both Chrêtien and 'Kiot' drew contained
doublets of this personage? In the one case in her original, in the other in a modified
form. An instructive parallel may be adduced from the saga of Cuchulainn. He is the
hero of an Andromeda episode and should by rights wed the delivered heroine, but the
story being already fixed before the episode was assimilated, the heroine is passed on to a
companion of the hero.—[A. N.]</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_89" class="pginternal">89</a>, line 766—'<i>Maestricht, or e'en Cologne</i>.' German art, in the early Middle Ages,
reached its highest level in the Rhenish provinces, especially at Cologne.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_91" class="pginternal">91</a>, line 828—'<i>Gurnemanz of Graharz</i>.' The old knight who instructs the hero
in knightly duties is a traditional part of the story, and belongs to most of the versions.
In Peredur, he is identified with the Fisher King, Perceval's uncle. In Chrêtien
his name is given as Gonemans of Gelbort; in Gerbert, Chrêtien's continuator, he is,
<i>Gornemant</i> (one of several points of contact between Gerbert and Wolfram's source).</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_91" class="pginternal">91</a>, line 847—'<i>He bade them lead the guest in</i>.' This is one of the many passages
which afford an interesting glimpse of the manners and customs of a bygone age. It
may be well to summarise here what we know of the reception and treatment of a guest in
the Middle Ages. If a strange knight rode into the courtyard of a castle he was received
by squires and pages, who held his bridle and assisted him to dismount. The guest was
then conducted to a chamber where he was disarmed and provided with suitable robes.
In every important household there was a <i>Kleider-kammer</i>, or wardrobe, presided over
by a chamberlain, whose office it was to see that all guests were provided with garments
fitted to their station. The preparation of these dresses was the work of the women of the
household, and it can have been no light task, as even if a whole company arrived they
would all expect to be provided with the requisite dress. The guest, being robed, was
then conducted to the great Hall, which was in the upper story of the castle. Half-way
on the staircase leading to it, he would be met, and welcomed with the kiss of greeting, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
both host and hostess (cf. Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 107), and led by them into the Hall where he
would receive the greeting of the assembled company. When all were seated the guest
would say who he was, and whence he came, but, if he kept silence on this point, it was not
etiquette to ask him till the next morning (cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 95). The evening meal then
followed, after which, on occasions of great festivity, such as that recounted in Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span>
(marriage feast of Gawain and Orgeluse) there would be dancing, otherwise the time seems
to have been spent in conversation till the appearance of the wine-cup, <i>Nacht Trunk</i>,
gave the signal for separation. Then knights conducted the guest to his chamber, where
pages disrobed him, and apparently waited with lighted tapers till he fell asleep. The
account given here of Parzival's visit to Gurnemanz gives a very good idea of how the
following day would be spent, indeed Wolfram's love for detailed description, and accuracy
of statement render this poem peculiarly valuable to a student of the manners and customs
of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>From various hints in the Gawain episodes, notably Books <span class="smcap">X.</span> and <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, it seems as if the
privilege extended to a guest might on occasion be construed with a freedom decidedly
repellent to modern ideas.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_96" class="pginternal">96</a>, lines 984, 985—'<i>Full five shall thy senses be</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 200.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_98" class="pginternal">98</a>, line 1055—'<i>The prince bade his daughter hither</i>.' The introduction of
Gurnemanz' daughter, and her incipient love affair with Parzival is peculiar to this
version. There is a curious discrepancy to be noted between the apparent susceptibility
of the hero here and in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> pp. 260, 261, and his indifference to feminine charms
displayed elsewhere, notably in his rejection of Orgeluse's advances and neglect of the
Château Merveil adventure. The latter presentment seems most in accordance with
Parzival's character; is the susceptibility to be ascribed to the <i>poet</i>?</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_99" class="pginternal">99</a>, line 1080—'<i>I lose once more a son</i>.' The sons of the old knight are mentioned
in other versions, but Wolfram alone names them. The circumstances of Schenteflur's
death are recounted in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 121; the account given of the other two sons is largely
borrowed from Hartmann's <i>Erec</i>, where the strife for the hawk at Kanedig, and the
venture, Schoie-de-la-kurt (which is not a person, but an expedition), is fully recounted.
Brandigan is Klamidé's kingdom, cf. Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span>; Mabonagrein, his cousin, Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 123.
Mahaut is another form of the name Matilda. From <i>Titurel</i> we learn that Gurzgrei and
Mahaut were the parents of Schionatulander, Siguné's lover, cf. also Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 245
and note.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_104" class="pginternal">104</a>, line 26—'<i>The city of Pelrapär</i>.' In Chrêtien the name of the city is 'Beau-repaire,'
of which this is evidently the German rendering. The substitution of <i>p</i> for <i>b</i> is
still a distinguishing mark of German pronunciation of French. In <i>Sir Percyvelle</i> it is
'the maiden land.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_104" class="pginternal">104</a>, line 38—'<i>The King Klamidé</i>.' This character is named by Wolfram and
Chrêtien only; in <i>Peredur</i> he is the Earl; in Sir Percyvelle, 'Sowdane.' Chrêtien
calls him 'Clamadex,' and it is worthy of note that in <i>Perceval li Gallois</i> the son of
the Red Knight slain by Perceval is called 'Clamadas,' evidently a variant of the same
name.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_105" class="pginternal">105</a>, line 78—'<i>My lord the Count of Wertheim</i>.' Wertheim is in Lower
Franconia. Bartsch thinks either Poppo <span class="smcap">I.</span> or his son Poppo <span class="smcap">II.</span> is referred to here.
From the expression used, 'my lord,' it seems as if Wolfram had at one time been in his
service.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_106" class="pginternal">106</a>, line 89—'<i>Trühending</i>.' There are three places of this name in the neighbourhood
of Eschenbach: Hohen, Alten, and Wasser-Trühending. The latter is still

Schoisianè, her death, and his subsequent adoption of the life of a hermit will be found
in Book IX. p. 274. From Wolfram's unfinished poem of <i>Titurel</i> we learn that Manfilot
was his companion.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_107" class="pginternal">107</a>, line 133—'<i>The twain Isoldé</i>.' An allusion to Isoldé la Belle, the wife of

Tristan's wife.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_109" class="pginternal">109</a>, line 208, <i>seq.</i>—'<i>Till the cry of heart-sorrow woke him</i>.' This nocturnal
visit of the Lady of the castle to the hero's chamber seems to be part of the original tradition,
and it is evident by the apologetic manner in which Wolfram tells the story that he
is somewhat puzzled by Kondwiramur's conduct. From the Introduction to Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span>,
and also from the blame he bestows on Chrêtien for having done a wrong to the story,
<i>Diese Märe unrecht gethan</i>, we gather that Wolfram set a high value on fidelity to his
source, and these and similar apologetic passages must be explained by the unwillingness
of the poet to depart from the traditional form of the legend, while, at the same time, the
story, representing as it did the manners and customs of an earlier and ruder period, was
somewhat distasteful to him.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_110" class="pginternal">110</a>, line 243—'<i>Kingron the Seneschal</i>.' This character is Aguigrenons in
Chrêtien, elsewhere he is unnamed. Mr. York Powell points out that Wolfram's form
presupposes an Aguigrenons, which would either indicate that the existing MSS. of Chrêtien,
or Chrêtien himself, misread <i>u</i> for <i>n</i>, or that Wolfram did <i>not</i> get his version by ear
as he maintains (or that Wolfram was following a source other than Chrêtien).</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_114" class="pginternal">114</a>, line 365, seq.—'<i>The marriage night</i>.' A similar account is given by Gerbert,
one of the continuators of Chrêtien. (Chrêtien himself does not record the marriage,
which takes place on a later visit of the hero to Beau-repaire.) In Gerbert's version we
have an indication of later influence, as the motive-power is the recognition by both
Perceval and his bride of the superiority of virginity to the married state. Wolfram's
version seems far more in accordance with the character of the hero, and is probably closer
to the original form of the story.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_116" class="pginternal">116</a>, line 420—'<i>Galogandres, Duke of Gippones</i>.' This character and Count

name is probably Keltic, and belongs to the original version of the story.</p>

as in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 106.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_132" class="pginternal">132</a>, line 111—'<i>And the host had bid them lay him</i>.' 'The Maimed King'
invariably figures in the Grail Romances, whether they deal only with the Quest, as here,
or with the early history of the Grail. He is generally wounded through the thighs, either
with a lance, or with a sword, but the circumstances under which he receives the wound
vary greatly. In most of the versions he is met with while engaged in fishing, and is
known as the Fisher King, or the 'Rich Fisher.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_132" class="pginternal">132</a>, line 125—'<i>The bleeding lance</i>.' This is a feature in most of the Grail
Romances, and seems to have been an original feature of the story, though it had not the
close connection with the <i>Grail</i>, which the fully developed Christian legend has given to
it. In the earlier versions of the story it is the weapon with which the Maimed King was
wounded; finally, it became the spear with which our Lord's side was pierced on the cross.
Wolfram, who never appears to connect the Grail with the Passion, gives it the first meaning.
The visit to the Grail Castle is told in varying forms, but the King, the Grail, Sword,
and Lance almost invariably appear, and the hero is either Perceval or his companion
Gawain, but Perceval is, undoubtedly, the original hero of the Quest.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_133" class="pginternal">133</a>, line 137 and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>The Grail Procession</i>.' In Chrêtien this is much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
simply treated. There are two squires bearing candlesticks, and two maidens, one of
whom carries the Grail, the other a silver dish, <i>tailleor</i>. Wolfram has evidently seized
the opportunity to give play to his love of detailed description, and his account of the
Grail Feast and the Grail Maidens is far more elaborate than any given elsewhere.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_136" class="pginternal">136</a>, line 223—'<i>The food-supplying powers of the Grail</i>.' In other romances of
the cycle we find similar powers attributed to the Grail. Malory, who borrowed largely
from the <i>Queste</i> and <i>Grand S. Graal</i>, gives a like account. There is evidently a connection
between this feature of the Grail, and the food-supplying talismans which figure
largely in the legendary lore of most countries.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_137" class="pginternal">137</a>, line 247—'<i>A squire who a sword did bear</i>.' Cf. p. <a href="#Page_144" class="pginternal">144</a>, lines 472 and <i>seq.</i>
This incident also occurs in Chrêtien, and in varying form in most of the versions. In this
poem the meaning and use of the sword are somewhat inexplicable. In Chrêtien that
sword
will break in <i>one</i> peril, known only to its maker, and then can be made whole by
dipping it in a <i>lake</i>. Wolfram's account seems to be based on a misunderstanding of a
French original. In some of the other versions the sword is already broken, and can only
be made whole by the achiever of the Quest. In Wolfram the sword is a very puzzling
feature of the story, with which indeed it seems to have little or no connection. The sword,
which breaks in Parzival's deadly combat with his unknown brother, is not <i>this</i> sword, but
the one taken from Ither of Gaheviess.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_141" class="pginternal">141</a>, line 371—'<i>A hidden hand drew the rope taut</i>.' Chrêtien has the incident
of the drawbridge rising, but in no other version are the reproaches addressed to the hero
immediately on his leaving the castle, they are invariably put into the mouth of the maiden
with the dead knight. In the <i>Perceval</i> the maiden's words, 'The Lord hates thee,' recall
Wolfram's <i>Ihr sult varen der sunnen has</i>, which Bartsch says is an ancient formula of
declaring a person accurst, and unworthy of the light of day.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_141" class="pginternal">141</a>, line 397—'<i>A woman's voice make moan</i>.' This meeting with the maiden
<i>after</i> the visit to the Grail Castle is in most versions the only one. In Chrêtien she now
tells the hero his name which he learns or guesses for the first time. It was not improbably
this incident which led either Wolfram, or his source, to place a first meeting
earlier in the story while still retaining one in the original position. Wolfram, with
characteristic love for detail, follows up the history of Siguné far more fully than other
writers of the cycle.</p>

other.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_159" class="pginternal">159</a>, line 2—'<i>From Karidöl and his kingdom</i>.' Karidöl=Carduel or Cardoile,
the Anglo-Norman form of Carlisle. This is undoubtedly Arthur's original capital, but
throughout this poem Nantes seems to be regarded as the royal city. Curiously enough
we find the two names combined in Gautier de Doulens, one of the continuators of <i>Li</i>
<i>Conte del Graal</i>, who introduces, as one of his <i>dramatis personæ</i>, Carduel of Nantes.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_160" class="pginternal">160</a>, line 29—'<i>Whitsuntide</i>.' An examination of the Romances will show this
statement to be correct; Pentecost and Christmas seem to have been the two feasts held
in especial honour at King Arthur's court.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_160" class="pginternal">160</a>, line 49—'<i>Blood-drops on the snow</i>.' Both Wolfram and Chrêtien insist only
on the <i>two</i> colours, red and white, and the fact that they are puzzled by, and think it
necessary to explain, the presence of snow at Whitsuntide shows that they are taking
over the incident from an older source. As a matter of fact it is to be found in tales
unconnected with the Arthurian cycle, and of varying nationality. In Peredur (Welsh) a
raven has settled upon the body of a wild goose killed by a falcon, and the hero thinks of
<i>three</i> colours (black, for hair; white, for skin; red, for cheeks); in the <i>Fate of the Sons</i>
<i>of Usnech</i>, an Irish tale written down before the middle of the twelfth century, and
probably centuries older, these three colours are likewise present, but it is a calf instead
of a wild goose that is slain, and it is the heroine, not the hero, who is fascinated by the
colours. The incident has always been a favourite one with Celtic story-tellers (cf. <i>Argyll</i>
<i>Tales</i>, M'Innes and Nutt, pp. 431-34), and curiously it is the slain-<i>bird</i>, instead of the
slain-<i>calf</i> version which predominates, although the <i>Fate of the Sons of Usnech</i> is
probably the most famous of all Irish stories, and no traceable literary influence of the
Welsh tale upon Irish romance is known. Those familiar with Grimm's fairy tales will
remember a similar incident in the story of <i>Snowdrop</i>, where the queen pricks her
finger, and wishes for a daughter with hair as black as the ebony window-frame, skin as
white as the snow, and cheeks as red as the blood; but here, of course, the 'fascination'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
element is absent. I have attempted to show ('the <i>lai</i> of Eliduc and the mürchen of
Schneewittchen,'<i>Folk Lore</i>. iii. <span class="smcap">I</span>), that the Gaelic version of the Schneewittchen type of
story represents the earliest attainable form of the story.—[A. N.]</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_162" class="pginternal">162</a>, line 87—'<i>Segramor</i>,' or Saigremors. This knight is a familiar figure in the
Arthurian Romances, and the episode is quite in accordance with his general character.
Chrêtien calls him 'Le Desreè' (uncurbed, impetuous). In Malory he is 'Le Desirous.'
Cf. also Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 241.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_163" class="pginternal">163</a>, line 121—'<i>To seek for the magic pheasant</i>.' Simrock thinks this an allusion
to a popular folk-tale, in which a magician, condemned to death, contrives to escape by
setting his judges and executioner to seek for the fallen bird, by the irresistible strains of
his magic pipe.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_166" class="pginternal">166</a>, line 235—'<i>Heinrich of Veldeck</i>.' A German poet who lived towards the end
of the twelfth century. His translation of the <i>Æneid</i>, founded on a French version of the
poem, was extremely popular, and Wolfram frequently refers to it in his <i>Parzival</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_169" class="pginternal">169</a>, line 321—'<i>Herman of Thuringia</i>.' This Landgrave of Thuringia is well
known to history as a generous patron of the literature of his day. His court at the Wartburg
was the resort of all the leading poets, and it filled a place in the literary life of the
twelfth century only comparable to that taken by the neighbouring court of Weimar six
hundred years later. The terms in which Wolfram speaks of the guests at the Wartburg
is quite in keeping with what is known of the Landgrave's lavish hospitality.</p>
<p>Simrock renders a passage from Walther von der Vogelweide which describes the
tumultuous life of the court as follows:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Wer in den Ohren siech ist oder krank im Haupt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Der meide ja Thuringen's Hof, wenn er mir glaubt.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Käm er dahin, er würde ganz bethöret;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ich drang so lange zu, dass ich nicht mehr vermag,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ein Zug fährt ein, ein andrer aus, so Nacht als Tag,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ein wunder ists, dass da noch Jemand höret.'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>The <i>Wartburg-krieg</i>, a poem of the end of the thirteenth century, in which the principal
poets of the age are represented as competing in song before the Landgrave,
supposes this contest to take place in 1207, and is doubtless an echo of what was no
unusual incident at that date. Wolfram's poem of <i>Willehalm</i> was composed at the
wish of the Landgrave, and in it he speaks of the death of his patron. Herman died in
1216, and the brilliant life at the Wartburg came to an end; his successor Ludwig, the
husband of S. Elizabeth, having little taste for literature.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_169" class="pginternal">169</a>, line 325—'<i>And so Knight Walter singeth</i>.' Walther von der Vogelweide,
one of the most famous of German lyric poets, was of knightly birth but small means; he
seems to have supported himself by his art, leading a wandering life at the principal
courts of his day. Of his connection with Wolfram nothing is known, save the fact of their
being together at the court of the Landgrave Herman in the early years of the thirteenth
century. The line here quoted does not occur in any of Walther's extant poems.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_169" class="pginternal">169</a>, line 328—'<i>Heinrich of Rispach</i>.' Nothing seems to be known of the
character here referred to. From the fact that there is a Rispach in the neighbourhood
of Eschenbach, Bartsch conjectures that it was some one personally known to Wolfram.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_171" class="pginternal">171</a>, line 385—'<i>The time when the knife's sharp blade</i>.' Wolfram is here quoting
from an unknown source. No such adventures are recorded in any Romance that has
come down to us; but they are quite in keeping with Gawain's character.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_176" class="pginternal">176</a>, line 529—'<i>The right of the Round Table</i>.' This custom is alluded to in
other Arthurian Romances, and we meet with it again in Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> Here Wolfram seems
to imply merely that the king did not eat in public with his knights, <i>i.e.</i> at the Round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Table, before they had heard of some knightly venture; in Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> he speaks as if
no meal might be partaken of by any of the courtiers till this came to pass. The first
rendering seems to be the correct one. [The whole incident is thoroughly in keeping
with the conventions of early Irish romance, in which the personages are invariably
subject to strict rules and obligations, <i>geasa</i>, to use the Irish word.—A.N.]</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_177" class="pginternal">177</a>, line 585—'<i>The Grail Messenger</i>.' This incident occurs in both Chrêtien and
Peredur, but the messenger is unnamed, or simply termed 'The Loathly Damsel.' Such
a damsel is met with in the <i>Perceval</i>, but when she reaches King Arthur's Court she is
transformed into a maiden of surpassing beauty. It will be noted that one of the queens
imprisoned in Château Merveil also bears the name of Kondrie (p. <a href="#Page_189" class="pginternal">189</a>). Mr. Nutt, in
his <i>Studies on the Legend of the Holy Grail</i>, suggests this was originally the Loathly
Damsel released from the transforming spell. (It may be noted that Wagner has kept
this idea, and in the first act his Kundrie is the Loathly Messenger; in the second,
'Kondrie la Belle.') Chrêtien's description of Kondrie's appearance is even more repulsive
than Wolfram's. In Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> we have a curious account of the origin of these strange
people.</p>
<p>[The 'Loathly Damsel' is one of those personages that most clearly testify to the
reliance of the romance-writers upon a traditional popular basis, and also in this instance
to the specific Celtic origin of that popular basis. A commonplace of folk-tales of the
'task' class is that the hero is helped by a personage having private ends of his or her own
to serve, as, until the hero achieves the Quest (which he never does unaided), the helper
cannot be released from a spell, generally of transformation into an animal, but sometimes
into a shape of surpassingly hideous ugliness. The oldest European variant of this latter
type with which I am acquainted is to be found in an Irish folk-tale imbedded in the
so-called Cormac's Glossary, a compilation of the tenth century. I have given this in full
(<i>Argyllshire Tales</i>, M'Innes and Nutt, pp. 467, 468). In its <i>outré</i> horror the description of
the bespelled king's son strikingly recalls that of Kundrie. Such a task story, in which
the hero is helped by a transformed personage, who cannot be delivered until the Quest is
achieved, is one of the main staples of the Perceval cycle, but it is only in the Welsh tale
of <i>Peredur</i> that the incident appears in a straightforward and intelligible form. The
sudden transformation from foulness to radiant beauty is met with in another connection
earlier in Ireland than elsewhere in Europe: the incident of the Perilous Kiss, in which the
embrace of a courteous knight frees a bespelled damsel from loathly disguise, an incident
frequently associated with Gawain, is, as I have shown (<i>Academy</i>, April 30, 1892), of early
occurrence in Ireland. Another element which goes to the complex individuality of
Kundrie can be paralleled from early Irish romance. As the female messenger of the fairy
dynasty of Mazadan, she corresponds to Leborcham, the female messenger of the semi-mythic
King Conchobor, the head and centre of the oldest Irish cycle of heroic romance.
Like Kundrie, Leborcham was of startling and unnatural hideousness, and she is brought
into special connection with Cuchulainn the chief hero of the Ulster cycle, as Kundrie is
with Perceval the chief hero of one group of the Arthur romances.—A.N.]</p>

<p>Introduction, line 1-16—This passage is somewhat obscure, but the meaning appears
to be that the poet thinks he may possibly be blamed for leaving the history of Parzival,
his chief hero, to follow the fortunes of Gawain; and would excuse himself for so doing by
the plea of fidelity to his source. Very few of the romances of this date can be considered
<i>original</i> works in the sense in which we would now employ that term; they were mostly a
re-statement, or re-combining of traditional material, and it was a point of honour to
adhere closely, in the march of incident, to the original form, though the poet was free to
do as Wolfram has done, and introduce personal and contemporary allusions, or give his
own interpretation of the meaning of the tale. The fact that Wolfram here so strongly
blames those who depart from the traditional form of the story, and at the end of his
poem specially accuses Chrêtien of having sinned in this way, seems a strong argument
against the theory that Chrêtien, and Chrêtien alone, was Wolfram's source of information.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_195" class="pginternal">195</a>, line 2—'<i>Gawain</i>.' <i>Gauvain</i> (French), <i>Gwchlmai</i> (Welsh). In all the earlier versions
of the Grail story this knight plays a part only secondary to that of the chief hero
Perceval. Certain episodes of which he is sole hero, in Chrêtien as in Wolfram, break the
course of the Perceval story, though Wolfram, with considerable skill, has brought them into
close connection with the main thread of the legend. With Chrêtien's continuators, too,
Gawain is an important character, he also visits the Grail Castle and fails to ask the question;
and a German version of the Grail legend, <i>Diu Krône</i>, by Heinrich von Türlin, makes him
the chief hero, it is he who achieves the Quest and heals Anfortas. It is noticeable that
none of the earlier versions know anything of either Lancelot or Galahad as Grail-seekers;
Wolfram does mention the former, but only incidentally, and throughout his poem he
evidently looks upon Gawain as the typical Arthurian knight, the pride and glory of the
Round Table. It is curious that, though he feels himself compelled to apologise for some of
the characters, to make an elaborate defence for Kay, and find excuses for Kondwiramur,
Wolfram never has a word of blame for Gawain, and strong as the contrast is between his
morality and that of Parzival, he certainly never draws a comparison to the disadvantage
of the former; as husband of Orgeluse and lord of the Château Merveil, Gawain's lot in
life is brilliant enough to awaken the envy of Kay who is jealous for King Arthur's honour.
The whole presentment of Gawain in the poem is an eloquent commentary on the moral
teaching of the original Arthurian legend, of which he is the oldest representative.
Later compilers seem to have felt this, and as the legend gradually became ecclesiasticised,
and assumed the form of a religious romance, so the original heroes of the story were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
gradually supplanted by others, whose characters, in the opinion of monkish compilers lent
themselves more to purposes of moral edification. Thus Perceval the married man was
forced to yield to Galahad the celibate, and, though he was never driven out of the story,
was relegated to a secondary position; and Gawain, whose character in the early
romances defied any attempt at converting him into a moral example, became merely a foil
to the superior virtue of his companions, while the adventures originally ascribed to him
were passed over to the repentant sinner Lancelot. The order of Grail heroes seems to
have been as follows: Perceval, Gawain; Perceval, Gawain, Lancelot; Galahad, Perceval,
and Lancelot. It is in this last order that they have come down to us through Malory's
redaction of the legends.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_196" class="pginternal">196</a>, line 34—'<i>The steed from Monsalväsch came</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 273, where
Parzival's possession of a Grail-steed leads to his being mistaken for Lähelein.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_198" class="pginternal">198</a>, line 96—'<i>Meljakanz</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 72 and note.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_198" class="pginternal">198</a>, line 105—'<i>Meljanz of Lys</i>.' It will be seen, from the list of traditional events
given above, that this character appears in other versions of the Perceval legends. Though
the context is different, the name with but little variation appears in other of the Grail
romances, Malory has Melias de Lile, in every instance the name indicates a French origin.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_198" class="pginternal">198</a>, line 119—'<i>Lippaut</i>.' The name of this character in Chrêtien is Tiebaut of
Tintaguel, the German is evidently a rendering of this French name. Tintaguel seems to
point to a Keltic original.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_199" class="pginternal">199</a>, line 124—'<i>Obie and Obilot</i>.' Bartsch considers that both these names are
derived from a French source, Obie, from the verb <i>obier</i>, signifying excitable, passionate;
Obilot, from the French <i>belot</i>, a fair child. In Chrêtien the sisters are unnamed, but the
younger is called <i>La pucièle as mances petites</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_199" class="pginternal">199</a>, line 136—'<i>Galoes and Annora</i>.' Here we learn, for the first time, the name
of Galoes' love, cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 46 and note. Annora is the same name as Eleanor.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_200" class="pginternal">200</a>, line 168—'<i>Lisavander</i>.' The French has several variations of this name,
Teudaves, Travezdates, Trahedavet.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_205" class="pginternal">205</a>, line 318, and p. <a href="#Page_219" class="pginternal">219</a>, line 781—'<i>A charger the king bestrode</i>.' This is an
allusion to the captivity of Queen Guinevere and her rescue by Lancelot. Kay was
among her would-be liberators, and was smitten by Meljakanz: 'enbor ûs dem satele hin,
daz in ein ast der helm gevienc, und bi der gurgelen hienc.' This incident is related in Hartmann's
<i>Iwein</i>; but the subsequent freeing of the queen by Lancelot, referred to on p.
219, is taken from Chrêtien's <i>Chevalier de la Charrette</i>. The adventure is again alluded
to in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_210" class="pginternal">210</a>, line 493—'<i>Gawain and Obilot</i>.' Though Chrêtien and Wolfram agree here
in the main outline of the story, yet the details differ completely, and the episode as
related by the German poet is far more graceful and poetical in treatment. In Chrêtien
the elder sister strikes the younger in the face, and it is in order to avenge this insult that
the child begs Gawain to fight for her. It is the father, and not the child herself, who
suggests presenting the knight with a token; he bids Gawain at first pay no attention to
her request, and there is no trace of the pride and affection with which Lippaut evidently
regards both his daughters, or of the confidence between father and child which is so
charming a feature in Wolfram's poem. Gawain, according to Chrêtien, does not present
his little lady with the captured monarch, but only with his steed, a compliment she shares
too with his hostess and her daughters. In the French poet we have nothing of the
amusing assumption of maiden dignity by the child Obilot, or of the graceful courtesy,
half serious, half laughing, with which Gawain falls in with her whim, and sustains his
part in the pretty play. Critics have bestowed much praise on this book, and on the
character of the child Obilot, and some have thought that, in the picture of father and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
child, and in the words put into Lippaut's mouth, we have a glimpse of the home life of
the poet, and an expression of personal feeling. In <i>Willehalm</i>, Wolfram refers to his
daughter's dolls, and throughout his poems he frequently alludes to children, their ways,
and their amusements. However that may be, nowhere else in the poem does <i>Gawain</i>
appear to so much advantage as in this episode.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_211" class="pginternal">211</a>, line 522—'<i>Parzival</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 188, line 941.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_216" class="pginternal">216</a>, line 668—'<i>Even now shall the Erfurt vineyards</i>.' <i>etc.</i> An allusion to the siege
of Erfurt by the Landgrave Herman in 1203. As the poet speaks of the traces of strife as
being yet visible, this book of the Parzival must have been written not long after that date.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_217" class="pginternal">217</a>, line 715, and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>The captive Breton knights</i>.' It is doubtful to what
romance Wolfram here makes allusion. Chrêtien, in his <i>Chevalier la Charrette</i>, relates
the capture of some of Arthur's knights by King Bagdemagus-Poidikonjonz, when
Meljakanz carried off Guinevere, but they were released by Lancelot. Wolfram seems to
have known another version of the story, as he evidently did know a romance dealing with
the fate of Arthur's son, Ilinot, of whom we know nothing. He refers to this at length
in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> Cluse seems to betoken an enclosed space, a ravine, Chrêtien calls it
<i>Le passage des pierres</i>—The Gampilon was a fabulous beast of the dragon type, also
mentioned in the <i>Gudrun</i>.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_218" class="pginternal">218</a>, line 733—'<i>The Red Knight</i>.' It is worth noticing that, throughout the Gawain
episodes, Wolfram never loses sight of his principal hero; if Parzival does not appear
personally, as he does in this book, he is always alluded to in direct connection with the
development of the story, <i>e.g.</i>, Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> pp. 242, 243. This is not the case in Chrêtien,
where the Gawain episodes are entirely independent. Some critics have evolved an
elaborate theory to account for the importance assigned to Gawain in this and following
books, and maintain that Wolfram felt that while Parzival was a prey to spiritual doubt
and despair, it was more artistic to keep him in the background than to make him the
hero of a series of chivalrous adventures. The more probable solution seems to be exactly
the opposite, viz., that the Gawain episodes were already introduced into the legend,
that Wolfram, or his source, felt it a flaw that they should have so little connection with
the main thread of the story, and therefore conceived the idea of introducing the principal
hero, and, by keeping him always more or less <i>en évidence</i>, making it possible to weave
the Gawain adventures into the fabric of the legend, instead of leaving them an excrescence
on its surface—a conception which was finally perfected by the connection of
Orgeluse, Gawain's lady-love, with both Parzival and Anfortas, thereby bringing all the
different elements of the tale into touch each with the other.</p>

<p>The <i>Perceval</i> gives an account of an adventure with a lady and a chess-board of which
Perceval is the hero, but the circumstances differ entirely, being similar to those of an
episode found in <i>Gautier de Doulens</i> and also in <i>Peredur</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_229" class="pginternal">229</a>, line 14—'<i>Askalon</i>.' The name of this city in Chrêtien is Escavalon,
apparently a variant of Avalon. The name in Wolfram may be either a misunderstanding
of the French original, or it is not impossible that Askalon, being well known to the
Crusaders of that time, was purposely substituted for a similar sounding-title.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_230" class="pginternal">230</a>, line 26—'<i>Æneas and Dido</i>.' An allusion to the <i>Æneid</i> of Heinrich von
Veldeck, to which Wolfram often refers. We learn from line 121 that the writer was
already dead. Cf. note, Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_230" class="pginternal">230</a>, line 41—'<i>Where Mazadan reigned as Monarch</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 31, and
Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 263. There is evidently a confusion here between the fairy and her kingdom.
Fay-Morgan is, of course, the fairy-queen, and the name seems later to have been transferred
to Arthur's sister, who is called Morgan le Fay in Malory. Terre-de-la-schoie, given
in Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> as the name of the lady, is her kingdom; the confusion probably arises from a
misunderstanding of the French source. We find, on p. <a href="#Page_240" class="pginternal">240</a>, that the mother of King
Vergulacht, Fleurdamur, was sister to Gamuret, consequently Parzival and Vergulacht
are first cousins, and we are meant to understand that Gawain, who, as a lad, had seen
Gamuret at Kanvoleis (Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39), was struck by the king's likeness to his uncle and
cousin, though he evidently knows nothing of the relationship; cf. Appendix A for notes
on the supposed origin of the Angevin race.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_231" class="pginternal">231</a>, line 58—'<i>Not such as in Karidöl</i>.' This is the longest of the many
allusions to the <i>Erec</i> of Hartmann von Aue, and refers to the same incident as Book <span class="smcap">III.</span>
p. 81, cf. note on passage.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_232" class="pginternal">232</a>, line 106—'<i>The Margravine of Heitstein</i>.' This name varies greatly in the
MSS., but both Lachmann and Bartsch give the reading in the text. The Margravine
mentioned is identified with the wife of Berchtold von Chamm and Vohburg, who died in
1204.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_233" class="pginternal">233</a>, line 146—'<i>Of my father's sister</i>,' <i>etc.</i> This line is curious as giving a very
early instance of a play upon words familiar to us in modern puzzles. Gawain, of course,
simply states that he is 'his father's son,' and gives the queen no information whatever
as to his birth.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_234" class="pginternal">234</a>, line 181, and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>At length did she chance on some chess-men</i>,' <i>etc.</i> It should
be noted that chess-men, in the Middle Ages, were often of a very large size, and would
form no despicable weapons. In Chrêtien's version of the incident he specially speaks of
these as ten times larger than other chess-men, and of very hard ivory. Adventures in
which a chess-board plays a part are of not infrequent occurrence in the Grail romances.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_234" class="pginternal">234</a>, line 190—'<i>The Burger maids of Tollenstein</i>.' Tollenstein is a town in the
neighbourhood of Eschenbach; the allusion is evidently to some kind of Carnival sports
held there. Mock Tournaments, in which women took part, are often alluded to in old
French and German poems. The point of the allusion evidently is that they fought for
mere sport, while Antikonie fought in defence of her guest, and her action is therefore held
the more praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_235" class="pginternal">235</a>, line 221—'<i>The knight who to battle bade him</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 184 and
note.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_236" class="pginternal">236</a>, line 257—'<i>With a lance-thrust by Ekunât</i>.' Ekunât has been already
named in Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 99. It seems doubtful whence Wolfram derived this incident.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_238" class="pginternal">238</a>, line 316—'<i>As Kiot himself hath told us</i>.' This is the first time Wolfram
names the source whence he drew his poem. It has already been noted in the Introduction
that the existence of this Kiot is a matter of debate, as no poem of his has come down to
us, and apparently no other writer mentions his name. This passage should be compared
with Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 262, where the nature of the MS. in which Kiot found the story of
Parzival and the Grail is stated. It certainly seems clear that Wolfram <i>had</i> a source of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
information other than the poem of Chrêtien de Troyes; his other statements as to contemporary
events and contemporary literature are perfectly accurate, and we do not find
him inventing feigned names for other writers of the day; it therefore seems somewhat
unreasonable to conclude, simply because we know nothing of Kiot's work, that Wolfram
here, and in other passages, is, to put it mildly, inventing an elaborate fiction. The fact
of the great popularity obtained by Chrêtien's version of the Grail legend is quite enough
to account for the disappearance of a version which, for some reason or other (very
probably its curious account of the Grail), had failed to attract the popular fancy.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_240" class="pginternal">240</a>, line 363—'<i>If Turnus thou fain wouldst be</i>.' An allusion to the <i>Æneid</i> of
Heinrich von Veldeck, where Turnus reproaches Tranzes for cowardice, and is answered
in much the same strain as Liddamus answers Kingrimursel.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_240" class="pginternal">240</a>, line 387—'<i>Nay, why should I be a Wolfhart?</i>' This passage to line 398 is
an allusion to the great German epic, the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>, the various lays composing
which seem to have been brought into order and welded into a literary whole about this
time. Wolfram's version of the cook's appeal to Gunther varies slightly from the received
text and probably represents an older form.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_241" class="pginternal">241</a>, line 407—'<i>Sibech ne'er drew a sword</i>.' This is an allusion to the story of
Dietrich von Berne, parts of which were incorporated in the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>, where,
however, this special incident is not to be found. Ermenrich was uncle to Dietrich and
Emperor of Rome; Sibech, who seems to have been as faithless as he was cowardly, to
avenge a personal injury, counselled the Emperor to a course which brought about the
ruin of himself and his people.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_242" class="pginternal">242</a>, line 452—'<i>The wood Læhtamreis</i>.' Tamreis, as we find from Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span>, is
the name of a tree, this proper name seems to be combined from <i>Læh</i>, old French <i>les</i> = near,
and <i>tamreis</i> (tamarisk?). The knight is, of course, Parzival. Chrêtien has not this
incident; which is a proof of Wolfram's superior skill in controlling the thread of his
story.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_245" class="pginternal">245</a>, line 541—'<i>At Schoie-de-la-Kurt</i>.' Cf. note to Book <span class="smcap">III.</span>, where we find
the account of this venture, and of the death of Gurzgrei, son of Gurnemanz. Gandelus
is the brother of Schionatulander, Siguné's love.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_247" class="pginternal">247</a>, line 597—'<i>To the Grail must his pathway wend</i>.' It is a very curious
feature, both in this poem and in that of Chrêtien, that the Grail Quest, undertaken by
Gawain, is allowed to drop into oblivion. Wolfram only makes one more allusion to it,
Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, and Chrêtien apparently ignores it altogether. In other versions of the story,
and notably in Chrêtien's continuators, the achievement of the Grail Quest by Gawain is
an important feature. It is true that Chrêtien's portion of the <i>Conte</i> breaks off short
before the end of the Gawain episode, and that those who maintain that Wolfram had no
other source than Chrêtien point to this as a proof of their theory, urging that had
Chrêtien finished the poem he would undoubtedly have brought Gawain to Monsalväsch,
and that Wolfram, deserted by his source at this point, carried the Gawain Quest no
further. But it must be noted that Wolfram, who, according to this theory, has hitherto
followed Chrêtien with remarkable fidelity, shows no embarrassment at the loss of his
guide, but, by bringing Gawain promptly into touch with Parzival, finishes his poem in a
thoroughly coherent and harmonious manner, his conclusion agreeing, in certain peculiar
features, with his Introduction, which, also, is unknown to Chrêtien. The simplest
solution appears to be that <i>both</i> Chrêtien and Wolfram were in possession of a common
source, wherein the Gawain episodes were presented in an incomplete and abbreviated
form. Mr. Nutt points out that the Gawain Quest, as related by Chrêtien's continuators,
not only fails to agree with Chrêtien's commencement, but also presents features more
archaic than those of the Perceval Quest.</p>

<p>Introduction to line 25. This spirited opening, with its invocation of the embodied
'Frau Aventiure,' is peculiar to Wolfram. The entire episode is much more briefly treated
by Chrêtien, who brings his hero at once in contact with the pilgrims, and has neither the
meeting with Siguné nor the combat with the Grail knight.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_251" class="pginternal">251</a>, line 5—'<i>Frau Aventiure</i>.' This is a personification of the 'story' and of the
spirit of romantic story-telling. Grimm (<i>Kl. Sr.</i> i. 83-112) claims that we have here a
survival of the personifying instinct which led the northern poets to make 'Saga' a
daughter of Odin. The word itself is simply taken over from French romance where
<i>or dist l'Aventure</i> is a standing initial formula, in which <i>Aventure</i> exactly renders the
<i>maere</i> of the opening quatrain of the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>.—[A. N.]</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_251" class="pginternal">251</a>, line 6—'<i>Whom Kondrie, to find the Grail</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 187.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_252" class="pginternal">252</a>, line 34—'<i>The sword that Anfortas gave him</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> pp. 137 and 144,
and note.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_252" class="pginternal">252</a>, line 47—'<i>Schionatulander and Siguné</i>.' This is Parzival's third interview
with his cousin, who has a much more important rôle assigned to her in this poem than in
the other romances. The hero meets her at every important crisis in his life; on his first
entrance into the world, Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 79; after his visit to the Grail Castle, Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 141;
now, previous to his interview with the hermit; and finally, in Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> after he has won
the Grail kingdom and been reunited to his wife, he finds her dead, and buries her with her
lover. Siguné's parentage is fully given on p. <a href="#Page_274" class="pginternal">274</a> of this book.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_257" class="pginternal">257</a>, line 204—'<i>The Templar bold</i>.' This identification of the knights of the
Grail with the Templars (Templeisen) is a marked peculiarity of Wolfram's poem.
Nothing at all answering to the Grail kingdom and its organisation, as described in the
Parzival, is to be found elsewhere. The introduction of this spiritual knighthood, chosen
by Heaven, and, with special exceptions, vowed to celibacy, seems intended as a contrast
with, and protest against, the ideal of worldly chivalry and lax morality portrayed in
Arthur's court. Are we to attribute this feature of the poem to Wolfram himself or to his
source? Judging from the value Wolfram placed upon fidelity to tradition it seems
scarcely probable that he would have departed so far from his model as to introduce such
an entirely new and striking element into the story; nor have we any trace of the poet-knight's
connection with the order of Templars; but if the writer of the admitted French
source was an Angevin, who had been in the East during the Angevin rule in Jerusalem,
the connection is easily explained. Certainly, to judge from the freedom with which the
introduction to the story has been handled, 'Kiot' does not seem to have been hampered
with an undue respect for the traditional form of the legend.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_258" class="pginternal">258</a>, line 223—'<i>Nor Lähelein, nor Kingrisein, etc</i>.' Kingrisein is the father of
Vergulacht, supposed to have been slain by Gawain, cf. Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 240. King Gramoflanz
plays an important part in the poem from Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> onward. Count Laskoit, cf.
Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 99.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_258" class="pginternal">258</a>, line 230, and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>One turning the ground was snow-clad</i>.' Cf. reference
to spring snow in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 160. The pilgrim train met by Parzival differs in the
versions. The Montpellier MS. of Chrêtien has three knights and ten ladies; other MSS.
one knight and twenty ladies. Wolfram's account is more natural and more poetical.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_259" class="pginternal">259</a>, line 263—'<i>Dost thou mean Him, etc</i>.' The address of the knight in Chrêtien
is longer and conceived in quite a different spirit. It contains one remarkable passage;
speaking of the Crucifixion the knight says: '<i>Li fol Juis—c'on devroit tuer comme ciens</i>,' a
speech entirely out of keeping with the spirit of love and charity characterising Wolfram's
Old Knight, and Hermit. The German poem is, throughout, remarkable for the wide
spirit of tolerance displayed towards those outside the Christian pale; note, <i>e.g.</i>, Book <span class="smcap">I.</span>
and especially the character of Feirefis as depicted in the two closing books of the work.
The religious teaching in this ninth book is not only fuller than in Chrêtien, but seems
based on a much clearer realisation of the position of the <i>individual</i> soul towards its
Creator. The elementary truths of Christianity are much more fully stated, and display a
familiarity with the theological speculations of the day which renders them peculiarly
interesting. There is no parallel, either, in Chrêtien to the fine speeches which Wolfram
puts into the mouth of his hero. The whole episode in the French poem lacks the dignity
and impressiveness which stamp it in the German version; it is in this book, and in the
account of Parzival's boyhood, that Wolfram's poetical genius touches its highest point,
and his superiority to Chrêtien is most clearly seen.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_261" class="pginternal">261</a>, line 337—<i>'Towards Fontaine Sauvage</i>,' <i>etc.</i> Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 151.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_261" class="pginternal">261</a>, line 348—'<i>Kiot</i>.' Cf. note to Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> It is noticeable that there is no
corresponding passage to this in Chrêtien; the explanation of the Grail mystery given in
the <i>Conte du Graal</i> is due to Chrêtien's continuators, and occurs in the later part of
the poem.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_262" class="pginternal">262</a>, line 359—'<i>Flegetanis</i>.' A curious contradiction will be noted here. A few
lines above we read that no heathen skill could have revealed the mysteries of the Grail,
and yet apparently it was a heathen who first wrote of them. The whole account of the
Grail reads like a not-too-successful attempt to Christianise a purely pagan legend.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_263" class="pginternal">263</a>, line 383—'<i>And in Britain, France, and Ireland, etc</i>.' Cf. Appendix A and
note on Mazadan, Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> Nevertheless, the connection of the Grail race with the
House of Anjou, save through Herzeleide's marriage with Gamuret, is nowhere stated, nor
how Titurel was descended from Mazadan, the ancestor alike of Arthur and of Gamuret.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_265" class="pginternal">265</a>, line 465—'<i>The altar and shrine</i>.' Wolfram appears to be absolutely correct
here; during the Middle Ages, a shrine, or reliquary, was generally placed on the altar, the
use of a cross was of comparatively late date. It is curious that Chrêtien, otherwise more
ecclesiastical in his details than Wolfram, has missed the characteristic feature of the
stripped altar; on the other hand, he notes that Perceval spends <i>Easter</i> with the
Hermit, and receives the Sacrament, while Wolfram passes Easter over without mention.
(It is rather odd to find Chrêtien's Hermit saying <i>Mass</i> on Good Friday!)</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_267" class="pginternal">267</a>, line 531—'<i>Ashtaroth</i>.' Bartsch says that these names are derived from
Talmudic tradition; Belcimon being Baal-Schemen, a god of the Syrians; Belat, the
Baal of the Chaldeans. Rhadamant is, of course, the Greek ruler of the under-world.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_267" class="pginternal">267</a>, line 533, and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>When Lucifer and his angels</i>.' The belief that the
creation of man was directly connected with the fall of the rebel angels was very widespread,
though the relation of the two as cause and effect was sometimes the reverse of
that stated here. None of the editions of the Parzival give a direct reference to the source
of the curious 'riddling' passage which follows, but the theory of the maidenhood of the
earth was a favourite one with Mediæval writers.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_268" class="pginternal">268</a>, line 572—'<i>Plato and the Sibyls</i>.' A curious proof of the belief of the Mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Church in the Christian nature of the Sibylline prophecies is found in the first line of
the <i>Dies Iræ</i>:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dies Iræ, Dies Illa,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Solvet sæclum in favilla<br></span>
<span class="i0">Teste David cum Sibylla.'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_270" class="pginternal">270</a>, line 615, and <i>seq.</i>—'<i>The Grail</i>.' The account of the Grail given by Wolfram
is most startling, differing as it does from every other account which has come down to
us. Wolfram evidently knows nothing whatever of the traditional 'vessel of the Last
Supper,' though the fact that the virtue of the stone is renewed every <i>Good Friday</i> by a
<i>Host</i> brought from Heaven seems to indicate that he had some idea of a connection
between the Grail and the Passion of our Lord. Various theories have been suggested
to account for the choice of a precious stone as the sacred talisman; Birch Hirschfeld
maintains that it arose entirely from a misunderstanding of Chrêtien's text, the French poet
describing the Grail as follows:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'De fin or esmeree estoit;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pieres pressieuses avoit<br></span>
<span class="i0">El graal, de maintes manieres,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Des plus rices et des plus cieres<br></span>
<span class="i0">Qui el mont u en tiere soient.'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>But how Wolfram, who, in other instances appears to have understood his French source
correctly, here came to represent an object of gold, adorned with <i>many</i> precious stones, as
<i>a</i> precious stone, does not appear. And it must be noted that this importance assigned to
a jewel is not out of keeping with the rest of the poem. From the jewel of Anflisé, the
ruby crown of Belakané, and the diamond helmet of Eisenhart in the first book, to the long
list of precious stones adorning the couch of Anfortas in the last, the constant mention of
jewels is a distinct feature of Wolfram's version, and cannot be paralleled by anything in
Chrêtien. Moreover, in two other instances, viz. the armour of Feirefis in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span>, and
the couch of Anfortas already mentioned, mystical and strengthening powers are attributed
to them. The <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> vary in their spelling of the stone, giving <i>Lapis</i>, <i>Lapsit</i>,
<i>Jaspis</i>, <i>exillis</i>, <i>exilix</i> or <i>erillis</i>; and it is impossible to identify the stone of the Grail with
any known jewel. The fact that Wolfram alone of all the writers of this cycle gives this
version of the legend, seems to point rather to a peculiarity in his source than to a genuine
tradition of the origin of the Grail-myth. In any case it is most probable that the responsibility
for the statement rests with the author of Wolfram's French source rather than with
Wolfram himself.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_271" class="pginternal">271</a>, line 665—'<i>They who took no part in the conflict</i>.' This account of the
neutral angels is partially contradicted by Trevrezent in Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> during his last interview
with Parzival, when he openly admits that he had spoken untruly in order to induce
Parzival to give up his Quest for the Grail. This contradiction introduces a good deal of
uncertainty as to what really is the moral aim of the poem.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_273" class="pginternal">273</a>, line 711—'<i>The white dove I see on its housing</i>.' This, the badge of the
Grail knights, is peculiar to the German poem. Those familiar with Wagner's <i>Parsifal</i>
will not need to be reminded that the dove and the swan are represented by him as the
sacred birds of the Grail. The connection with the swan will be found in Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_273" class="pginternal">273</a>, line 737—'<i>O thou son of my sister</i>.' The relationship of uncle and nephew
between the hermit and the hero of the Quest obtains in most of the versions. The relationship
with the wounded king varies, sometimes he is the hero's grandfather.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_274" class="pginternal">274</a>, line 759—'<i>Thou wast the beast that hung</i>,' <i>etc.</i> Cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 58. This
incident of the mother's dream is peculiar to Wolfram.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_274" class="pginternal">274</a>, line 771—'<i>Repanse de Schoie</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 135 and Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> She
finally marries Feirefis, Parzival's half-brother.</p>
<p>Page 375, line 785—'<i>But if love the Grail King seeketh</i>.' This explanation of the
wound of Anfortas as the punishment of unlawful love is peculiar to Wolfram, and is in
accordance with the superior depth and spirituality of his treatment of the legend. In the
other versions the king is wounded in battle or accidentally. The various remedies tried
for the wound, related on pp. <a href="#Page_276" class="pginternal">276</a>, <a href="#Page_277" class="pginternal">277</a>, give a curious idea of the surgical skill of the Middle
Ages, and seem drawn from a mixture of Oriental and classical sources. The names in
line 830 are derived from the Greek, and signify various serpents, with the exception of
Ecidemon, which we learn in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> was an animal greatly feared by snakes, perhaps
the Ichneumon. The reference to Æneas and the Sibyl is from the <i>Æneid</i> of Heinrich
von Veldeck.</p>
<p>The legend of the pelican is well known, and the first part of the passage referring to
the unicorn, its love for a spotless maiden, was a widespread fiction of the Mediæval
times, but the assertion that the carbuncle is found under the unicorn's horn seems peculiar
to Wolfram, and illustrates what has been said above as to his employment of precious
stones.</p>
<p>On p. <a href="#Page_281" class="pginternal">281</a> we find a full account of the influence of the planets upon the wound.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_278" class="pginternal">278</a>, line 867—'<i>A knight should come to the castle</i>.' This promised healing of
the king by means of a question put by the hero is a marked 'folklore' feature of the
tale. Mr. Nutt points out in his <i>Studies</i> that in the Grail legend we have a version of
the well-known visit to a magic castle influenced by two distinct formulas familiar to folklore
students, (<i>a</i>) where the object of the hero is to avenge the death, or wounding, of a
relative—the Feud-quest; (<i>b</i>) to release the inhabitants of the castle from an enchantment—the
un-spelling quest. The bleeding lance seems to be connected with the first (perhaps
also the sword, but its employment both in Wolfram and Chrêtien is so enigmatic that it
is difficult to know what import to attach to it), the question with the second. The form
of the question differs here; in all the other versions it is connected with the Grail: 'Whom
serve they with the Grail?' Here, directly with the wounded king, 'What aileth thee, mine
uncle?' Birch Hirschfeld maintains, first, that the question was a 'harmless invention'
of a predecessor of Chrêtien's (thus ignoring the archaic character of the incident);
secondly, that Wolfram, having misunderstood Chrêtien's account of the Grail, was naturally
compelled to invent a fresh question. Of the two, Wolfram's question seems distinctly
the more natural, and the more likely to occur to the mind of a simple youth like
Parzival; and he has also made much better use of the incident. It is Parzival's failure in
the spirit of charity, in the love due 'as a man to men,' that constitutes the sin of the omitted
question. Mr. Nutt well remarks that 'It is the insistence upon charity as the herald and
token of spiritual perfection that makes the grandeur of Wolfram's poem.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_283" class="pginternal">283</a>, line 1038—'<i>If a land be without a ruler</i>.' Here we have the germ of the
well-known story of Lohengrin, related in Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> We learn from this passage that
Lohengrin's mission was no isolated instance, but a part of the office of the Grail knights.
Wolfram's whole presentment of the Grail kingdom, as won by an act of love to a fellow-man,
and used for the benefit of others, offers an ideal, not only curiously modern in tone,
but in striking contrast to the glorification of spiritual selfishness which we find in other
Grail romances. Elsewhere, the aim of the achiever of the Quest is purely to save his <i>own</i>
soul, and, the task accomplished, he passes away leaving the world none the better for
his work. If we look at the concluding lines of the poem, Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span>, we shall find that
Wolfram had quite a different idea of a man's duty to the world of his day.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_283" class="pginternal">283</a>, line 1045—'<i>King Kastis wooed Herzeleide</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 48.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_284" class="pginternal">284</a>, line 1070—The account of Trevrezent's wanderings is curious, as it mixes up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
fabulous places such as Agremontin, the home of the Salamanders, and Fay-Morgan,
with such well-known names as Seville, Sicily, and Aquilea. Rohas has been identified
with a range of mountains in Styria; Celli is also in Styria. The derivation of 'Gandein'
from a Styrian town is very curious. Whether the name was in Wolfram's source or not,
we cannot decide, but the connection can only have been introduced by the German poet.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_286" class="pginternal">286</a>, line 1127—'<i>Two mortal sins</i>.' It is curious that in no other version of the
story is the slaying of the Red Knight regarded as a sin. Here, however, it is quite in
keeping with the pronounced knightly character of the poem. Ither is Parzival's near
kinsman, apparently both cousin, and uncle by marriage (lines 1108 and 1119), and to fight
with one connected either by the tie of blood or of friendship is regarded throughout as a
breach of knightly faith, cf Books <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> and <span class="smcap">XV.</span> where Parzival fights, unwittingly, with
Gawain and Feirefis. In Chrêtien the hermit tells Perceval that it is his sin in causing
the death of his mother which has sealed his lips before the Grail; Wolfram seems to
regard his silence independently, and, as noted above, the sin, there, seems to be failure in
charity and in recognising the bond of universal brotherhood; which failure, indeed, is at
the root of the 'two mortal sins.'</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_287" class="pginternal">287</a>, line 1159—'<i>Titurel</i>.' The father of the Fisher King is not named in
Chrêtien, and indeed is only alluded to in an obscure and enigmatical passage as being
nourished by the Grail. This statement is peculiar to these two writers, and seems to
indicate that they were in possession of a common source.</p>
<p>Page <a href="#Page_287" class="pginternal">287</a>, line 1169—'<i>An thou wouldst that thy life be adornèd</i>.' The passage which
follows here to line 1180 should be noted, as it seems to be an interpolation; it has no
connection whatever with the context, and is in quite a different tone from the knightly and
unecclesiastical character of the rest of Trevrezent's teaching.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
