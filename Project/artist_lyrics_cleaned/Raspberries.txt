I never knew how complete love could be
'Til she kissed me and said

"Baby, please (Baby) go all the way
It feels so right (Feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please (Baby) go all the way
Just hold me close (Hold me close)
Don't ever let me go (Don't let me go)"

I couldn't say what I wanted to say
'Til she whispered, "I love you so"

"Please (Baby) go all the way
It feels so right (Feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please (Baby) go all the way
Just hold me close (Hold me close)
Don't ever let me go (Don't let me go), oh no"

Before her love, I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place where my heart should have been
But now I've changed and it feels so strange
I come alive when she does all those things to me
And she says (Come on)
"Come on (Come on)
(Come on)
Come on (Come on)
I need you (Come on), I love you (Come on)
I need you (Come on)"
(Come on)

"Please (Baby) go all the way
It feels so right (Feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please (Baby) go all the way
Just hold me close (Hold me close)
Don't ever let me go (Don't let me go), oh no"

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, ow
Got to go all the way, yeah
