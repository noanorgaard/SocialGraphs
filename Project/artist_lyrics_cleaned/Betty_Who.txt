Exotic sweetness, a magical time

Remember when I'd call you every now and then
So good, that on and off again, and on again

Just with a touch of your lips
I want you to come home

Who's around when the days feel long?
Who's around when you can't be strong?
Who's around when you're losin' your mind?
