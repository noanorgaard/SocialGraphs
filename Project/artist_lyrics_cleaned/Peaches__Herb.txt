Let's show the world we can dance
Bad enough to strut our stuff
The music gives us a chance
We do more out on the floor
You might also like
Groovin' loose
Or heart to heart
We put in motion
Every single part
Funky sounds
Wall to wall
We're bumpin' booties
Having us a ball, y'all

Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now

We got the rhythm tonight
All the rest know we're the best
Our shadows crash in the light
Twisting, turning, we keep burning
Shake it high
Or shake it low
We take our bodies
Where they wanna go
Feel that beat
Never stop
Oh, hold me tight
Spin me like a top

Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now

There's nothing more that I'd like to do
Than take the floor and dance with you
Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

Groovin' loose
Or heart to heart
We put in motion
Every single part
Funky sounds
Wall to wall
We're bumpin' booties
Having us a ball, y'all
