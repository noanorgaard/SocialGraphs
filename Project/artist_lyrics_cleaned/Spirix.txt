So runnin' away, just tryna escape
There ain't a thing that's gonna break us down
So follow this way 'cause I just can't wait
You know that I need you now

You know that I need you now
You know that I need you now

See that you runnin' away, yah
Wasn't much more you could take, yah
Could tell by the look on you face
That you've been through it
You're sick of the pain, yah
If they kick you out, you could stay with me
Have you in the Hamptons, come lay with me
A house on the water, vacay with me
Say that you wanna move in, that's okay with me
But first let me check with my manager
You've been out runnin' so long with no stamina
Picture us leaving it all in the past
We could depart with no flash with no camera
Just trust me whenever you coming through
So we can escape in a Audi co
With you on the passengers side
Foot on the gas leaving this life behind

So runnin' away, just tryna escape
There ain't a thing that's gonna break us down
So follow this way 'cause I just can't wait
You know that I need you now

You know that I need you now
You know that I need you now

You know I'm not cynical
And sometimes it get difficult
But I'm tired of the typical
Let's do the unthinkable
Do the unthinkable

So runnin' away, just tryna escape
There ain't a thing that's gonna break us down
So follow this way 'cause I just can't wait
You know that I need you now

You know that I need you now
You know that I need you
