Always right there in the funk of life
Swimming in that motherfucker, never really cut them off
They remind me of my mother, shit is never black or white
Standard test, you probably other, hope that you the prototype
And ain't time to get a hundred, show ya right
Yeah show ya right
You got that black and gold complexion
And take away that affection
And that's about the time I get to go reaching for my weapon
That's money, drugs, and obsession, just enough to keep you guessing
Carry my own mind, you're such a better reflection
Tell me that you're right
Tell me that you're right

Baby when you're alone, I know you really alone
You just pretending cause you got to show the world you strong
The way you show'em off, that shit turn me on
Call me crazy but sometimes I wish you were the one
You might also like
I still got love for them all, all my XX
I still pick up when you call, you're my XX
See me out in the streets, you blow me XX
My new one don't pick up, you still be the next best

I'm always right there in the thick of it
I quit drinking everyday
Nighttime come around, I find excuses to go fly away
Said you were the one, yeah I probably tell a lie a day
Use to be a shy girl, now you take it off right away
Now you take it off right away
You got that liquor in your system
You ready for bad decisions
When we met you felt imprisoned
Now you free and really living
That shit it gotta cost
You got love you wanna give it
Nobody wanna take it
They already seen you naked now
Why you let the city take you down?

Baby when you're alone, I know you really alone
You just pretending cause you got to show the world you strong
The way you show'em off, that say it to me yo
Call me crazy but sometimes I wish you were the one
I still got love for them all, all my XX
I still pick up when you call, you're my XX
See me out in the streets, you blow me XX
My new one don't pick up, you still be the next best

Maybe we get high, just to come back down to 

Woooo
Leave it all behind
Hope that I still linger in your mind
Girl you left them marks up on my spine
Yeah I think it's time
I'm your territory, you're my diamond shine
When the going get rough, you go and get tough
Put it on that line for me
Picking my fights for me
Then we go to battle in that saddle
Do it like ooh nah nah nah
You tell your friends that he don't look like Trey
But I give that thing so good, you gotta stay for it
Exhale, blow that smoke in the sky
That stand that we take is for life
You might also like
I don't care about what you're saying, stop the playing
Cause you know I'm not the one for games
Don't hide your intentions, don't be scared to mention
That you want to hear me scream your name
I can take you high, I can take you low
I can speed it up, I can take it real slow
I just wanna lock it up, lock it up
Baby I'm just trying to lock it up, lock it up
Nah, nah, nah, hey

And I'm saying this one last time
And I promise this is the last time, nah
I'm not into rushing shit but can we move faster, nah
With some of that uh, uh
With some of that nah, nah
That good, good, that thug love
And my past baby, fuck it, it's whatever
Not into moving on and looking back, it just ain't clever
Nowadays I learned to never ever say "I never"
Cause I didn't think I'd ever move on something better
So I locked up and I threw away the key
Never want to relieve those painful memories
Just want to forget him while you all up under me
Promise to keep doing those things and make me weak


If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy
