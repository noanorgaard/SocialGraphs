And you left me standing on a corner cryin'
Feelin' like a fool for tryin'
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through, wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you

You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind
'Cause what you wanted, I couldn't give
What you did, boy, I'll never forget

And you left me standing on a corner cryin'
Feelin' like a fool for tryin'
I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through, wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
You might also like

And you left me standing on a corner cryin'
Feeling like a fool for tryin'
I don't even remember why I've wasted all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
'Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through, wasting all these tears on you
Oh, these tears on you

I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Layin' down on the bathroom
