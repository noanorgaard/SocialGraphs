Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number
And your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Like walkin' in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dyin'
And you're lookin' for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooo, you made me love you
Ooo, you've gone away
Ooo, you had me crawlin' up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree
But disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of

I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no, no

Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
