Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My God, I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high as I have got
I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger, things have happened

And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your mother****in' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a **** dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
**** that, do that ****, shoot that ****
Can you afford to blow this ****? Are you that rich?
Why you give a **** if she dies? Are you that ****?
Do you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?
