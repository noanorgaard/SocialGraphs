Cruisin down the boulevard feelin hella good
Smokin while I’m drivin, you would if you could
So I’ma push, smokin on this Reggie Bush
Avoidin the P’s, steady tryin to hit it (hit it)
Jesus G’s, you niggas don’t get it
And she’s a tease, you’re never gonna hit it
She say she wanna keep her clothes on
I’m not a drummer but this summer the beat goes on
I told her, let me flip this shit, then I’ll dip this shit
Then I’ll hit this shit, I’m the magnificent
Equivalent to no other, relevant to recover
Sell that shit to your mother

Tell me can you hear me knockin', knock knock-knockin'
I'll make, you feel be-beat droppin', drop drop-droppin'
The bass is bangin' out the place, place, is bangin' out
So can you hear, me-me knockin', knock knock-knockin'

You beat it like Ike Turner, I swang it like A-Rod
Up and coming rappers better keep they fucking day job
Cause I’m the best, so they got me mis-tooken
So clock in and watch this lyrical ass whooping
'Cause they got flows that make hoes sleepy like slow jams
My shit rocks (Cocaine) like Lindsay Lohan
Listen to Luda in the Cadillac Brougham
Try to turn me down and your niggas like, “No, man!”
Don’t you ever touch a black man’s radio!
‘Specially when Luda bust rhymes in scenario
Plat’ plaques from Rio to Ontario
Busting through your speakers like Tyson’s in your stereo

Tell me can you hear me knockin', knock knock-knockin'
I'll make, you feel be-beat droppin', drop drop-droppin'
The bass is bangin' out the place, place, is bangin' out
So can you hear, me-me knockin', knock knock-knockin'

Ugh, I’ll plug jumper cables to the bridge (Yay Area)
Put your lights back in this bitch (bitch)
West Coast representative from the label they call Sick Wid It
The best that ever lived it and spit it
And fucked around and got away with it
Ugh, ever since the ’80s, I’ve been paved wit it
Overlooked and underrated
Gotta keep it real with y’all, I can’t fake it (I can’t fake it)
Ugh, I be off-beat then I’m on-beat then I’m off-beat
Then I’m on-beat and my style is so unique
I gotta have one teeth in my mouth
And sweep a broad up off her feet (feet)
Took her down on the couch before I had a chance to speak
Skeeted all in her mouth and then we went for round three
We was tied just like the soap opera
At the same time, reached our peak
Tell me can you hear me knockin', knock knock-knockin'
I'll make, you feel be-beat droppin', drop drop-droppin'
The bass is bangin' out the place, place, is bangin' out
So can you hear, me-me knockin', knock knock-knockin'

Knock, knock, knock-knockin'
Knock, knock, knock-knockin'
The-the bass is knockin'
The bass-bass is knockin'
Busting through your speakers
Busting-busting through your speakers
Like, busting through your speakers
Bust-busting through your speakers like (ugh)
Feeling-feeling hella, feeling hella good
Busting through your speakers like Tyson's in your
