War, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives

(War, huh) Good God, y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothin'

(War, huh) Woah, woah, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothin'

They say we must fight to keep our freedom
