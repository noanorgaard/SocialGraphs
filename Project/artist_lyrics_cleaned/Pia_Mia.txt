Red, red love
Red love
Red, red love

All that I wanted was for the first one to care
You kept your secrets and told me life was unfair
Gave you my trust
You had me right there in your clutch
I felt the rush
Then you just looked away like

Red love
Red, red love

You didn't even turn around to look back
Didn't even stay to watch me cry
Now when I turn around to look back
Everything you said was a lie
Oh, baby baby

Red love
Red, red love
Red love
Red, red love

Guess I was dreaming
I wore my heart on my sleeve
And when the rain came pouring down
You were so far out of reach
But I'm waking up
Sometimes enough is enough
If I can never get it back
At least I gave it all for

Red love (Red love)
Red, red love (Red love)
Red love
Red, red love (Red love)
You didn't even turn around to look back
Didn't even stay to watch me cry
Now when I turn around to look back
Everything you said was a lie
Oh, baby baby

Red love
Red, red love

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion

'Cause you're good girl and you know it
Good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different around me

Just hold on we're going home

Bang bang, we're the talk of the town
You already know what they're talking about
Hit the block with the top let down
Pull up on the scene and we shut it down
Fired up, blow me in the wind
