Sitting in this empty room
Telling myself I'm over you
I'd rather be alone than lonely
Wonder if you're thinking of me
Well, do ya?
Time has passed, your found someone new
Look at what you've put me through
I'd rather be alone than lonely
Wonder if you're thinking of me
Well, do ya?

Baby, baby, baby, I wrote a song about you last night
It had the strangest melody
I wrote a song about you last night
And it went a little something like
La la la, you broke my heart in two
I don't know what to do, you got me so confused now
Baby, I wrote a song about you last night
You might also like
I was lost in the melody
Found in the memories
Just say you love me, I'll believe it
You don't even have to mean it
That's all I want

Every time I look around, I sit and wonder
Where did you disappear?
My thoughts are no longer acapella
But it doesn't seem to matter cause I feel you here
I feel you here

Baby, baby, baby, I wrote a song about you last night
It had the strangest melody
I wrote a song about you last night
And it went a little something like
La la la, you broke my heart in two
I don't know what to do, you got me so confused now
Baby, I wrote a song about you last night
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I wrote a song about you last night
It had the strangest melody
I wrote a song about you last night
And it went a little something like
La la la, you broke my heart in two
I don't know what to do, you've got me so confused now
Baby, I wrote a song about you last night,
