I was the knight, the shining armour in your movie
(oooh)
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
(oooh)
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me

You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide

Money the jealous type, I always knew it
I knew she'd come around if I only sweat the music
But I'm starting to believe that it's a problem to my health
Cause the size of half these checks
Could make me vomit on myself
But I give it up to heaven cause it isn't Jon
The chorus an instrumental, oh you think it's odd?
I don't have to give you lyrics cause I know it's God
That's why I get emotional when the chorus drops


We're not sad at all
We know you have to leave and we're not mad at all
You'll be back in town and we'll play basketball
And if you fall off track, we'll be your Adderall
We won't let your soul drown in luxury

Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is—

I am a robot, thoughtless and empty
Don't know who sent me, don't know who made me
Electric robot, everything's gray now
Numb to the pain now, I knew what love was

But somehow you convinced me again
My foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
My father's warnings run through my head

Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
