I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana 'nem stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol-popping Poppy Street

You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zigzagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas front street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner

Running to get to that check, I'm coming
Jumping out of that back seat, busting
Bust, bust, missions with the blower as a young'un'
Back when Killa Mo had 'em coppin' crystal through the prison door
Feel the four, when I'm feelin' low, time to stretch a nigga
Riding through your section, shit, I hope you got protection with you
Hop out when the cops out, shit, I'm cold with mine
Forty-five, brown rag, green light, Yoda time

Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)

One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop, don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before that niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knocking, then
Problem is, lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missing from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enroll in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hitting glass, get the money long
Gleaming with the tints and the stash, no tags
Bumping poison on the ave, getting cash 'til a nigga gone ('Til a nigga gone)
And ain't shit wrong with the truth

This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin is black as midnight, I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven as I pray for new McLarens
