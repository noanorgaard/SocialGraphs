Baby watch me up and go
Mama said that the boys like you never work out any way
(Boys like you)
My girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him back?" I say
Hell no, oh, hell no
I get it, whatever

Straight up, don't blame you
You’re not the Cash and I’m not the June
Never be the one to make you better
Whatever

Thinking of how you held me tight
Will I be lonely when I wake?
Did we make a big mistake?

'Cause I love the way you say good morning
And you take me the way I am

If you are chilly
Here, take my sweater
Your head is aching
I'll make it better

'Cause I love the way you call me baby
And you take me the way I am

I'd buy you Rogaine
When you start losing all your hair
Sew on patches
To all you tear

Oh, let's get rich
And buy our parents homes in the South of France
Let's get rich
And give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
Let's get rich
And build a house on a mountain, making everybody look like ants

So I will help you read those books
If you will soothe my worried looks
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf
