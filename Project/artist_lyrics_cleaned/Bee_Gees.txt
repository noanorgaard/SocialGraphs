And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
You might also like
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother

I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right

Gimme that night fever, night fever
