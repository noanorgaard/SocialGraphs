If I could tell you what's next

Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet
Perfect words that you said

I see angels and devils
And God, when you come on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Cinderella's gone to New York City
Wants to shave her head and disappear
18 years of never feeling pretty
Says she's finally thinking clear

Ain't too proud to swim or drown now baby (ain't too proud)
Ain't too proud to sink or see it through

She said
Everybody wants to be with me
I got all I need (all I need)
I feel invincible with my headphones on
Everybody posed for magazines (oh)
It's all just noise to me (noise to me)
I feel invincible with my headphones on
Oh (my headphones, headphones)

If anybody asks for me she said (oh, oh)
Tell 'em all I'm in the deep end singing (ooh, ooh)
With this music in my head

You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

You buckle my knees

Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode
