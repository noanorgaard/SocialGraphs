Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel that I can see your soul?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel the beat in your heart?
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now

Some days I'm built of metal, I can't be broken
But not when I'm with you
You love me real, we have it all
Can't leave me now
I love the way you are today
Run away with me now
Wind in my hair 'cause I don't care
Baby, run away with me now
Run away with me now
You might also like
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel that I can see your soul?
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel the beat in your heart?
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now
I-I want it, I want it real
Run away with me now

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

Drinking in the summer, I'm good at running
I beat you in the race again
Are you afraid when I look your way?
It's easiest to stay at home
But then we taste it, we gotta have it
We have no control
Where is the love, the kind we dream of?
The kind that makes us young
The kind
That makes us young
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me out
Don't leave me
Never leave me
