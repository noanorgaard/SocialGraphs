Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same
'Til the morning comes
Even roads feel the sun so cold
Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same
'Til the morning comes
Even roads feel the sun so cold

I've hit a wall
I can't look past it
Nothing at all
Nothing to mask it but
It feels so drastic but
I cannot panic so
I get my chance to go
And hit that fuckin' road

I've been waiting to long
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've been waiting too long

I can't tell at all
If I need to run back
And I can't speak at all
If I can't come back so
I just need to find my zone
I just need to find my home
I just need to find my throne
I just need to find my home

You can go, go, go
And go, go, go

Take myself somewhere fa-far
Somewhere new
I can't feel you
What am I supposed to do?
I won't look back on things that don't look my way
'Cause time has made me change
It won't let me stay
Why should I care when you absolutely never did?
Don't you know that love
It works both ways

You can go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave me
Here alone, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave me
Here alo-

I'm ridin' solo, baby
I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, baby
