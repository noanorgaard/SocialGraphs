Shake me all out if I'm wrong
For you, for you
Shake it all out when I'm gone
I, for you

Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep while the earth turns?
And his kids learn to say, "Fuck you," they don't love you
Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams while the earth burns?
She cries 'cause she's nothin' like you, is she like you?

What you want from a devil like me, devil like me?
You see, the devil don't mean to be evil
He just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation
Holes riddled in your head, little bit of lead
Shake it out and line a silhouette
Miss me when you, you wish weren't kind of glad

Light it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow
Up and dry
You're up and dry
A hundred suns, hundred notes, easy come, easy go
Up and dry
You're up and dry

Don't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more
Than everybody, anybody else
Seventeen and bad, was the best you never had
And you want, sins you never said for yourself

Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Everybody got a name
Everybody got a number
Seven sins, six frames
Five for the two of us
Three is too much if there's only one love, and

I don't believe that anybody's god ever felt this way
'Cause if they had, they never would've made me
They'd say "Hell no!" Wake me up at ten
Tomorrow, for my sake, keep the volume down please"
Doesn't everybody try to do their best at what they do best
And do less of the bad to begin with?
Doesn't leaving me mean a little less if you left my life
But never loved to begin with?
You never loved to begin with
You never loved me

The seventh month you keep
You stay for six days
And the seventh day you'll leave

Is this it?
What you want?
What you wanted?
Do you need love?
Am I enough for you?
In time you'll find I've got my baggage too

Say we'll get famous and we'll die with our names
In every paper, every news report as any consolation
To the people that you love and all the people that you hate
But we'll love you all the same because you're beautiful
Say you didn't see it, that I saw right through you
Say you didn't mean it that I mean nothing to you
Like you said
Do you believe me?
That I'll be right for you

Say you love me like you used to

We were born splaying in the wreckage
Tearing down on birds with stones
I bore my weight upon your shoulders
Water as warm as morning suns
I don't think quite like I used to
I got a bed to call my own
I see stars and painted lies
Broken glass upon your road
Now I'm driving home too soon

Woah, woah
Say you love me like you used to

And we'll vacation first class
I'm breaking your fall
You're breaking my ass
You're working all day
Hating on all the bitches at work
You say you're okay
You're faking, fucked up
You're drinking all day, you give me a cup
And I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive, baby
I say I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive
But is this what you want?
