Your house that sits behind me is covered in ivy green
The windows that we watch from are old and chipping at the beam

Takes me away, takes me away, takes me away
Takes me away, takes me away, takes me away
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

The scent you wear moves in lines from your apartment into mine, mine
You act like you don't know me
My god you tempt my anxious mind, mind

Takes me away, takes me away, takes me away
Takes me away, takes me away, takes me away
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you
Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you
Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you
Would it be much better if I knew, nothing about you

I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I
I'll go I'll go I'll go I

Takes me away takes me away take me away
Takes me away takes me away take me
