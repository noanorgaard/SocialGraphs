But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

I miss prosthesis and mended souls
Trample over beauty while singing their thoughts
I match them with my euphoria
When they said, "Je suis plus folle que toi"

But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

Don't be a downer
I'm doing my face
With magic marker
I'm in my right place
Don't be a downer
