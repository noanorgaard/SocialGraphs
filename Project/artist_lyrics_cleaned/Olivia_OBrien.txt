Hit that root beer float
Root beer float
I just hit that root beer float
(This has no chill, this has no chill whatsoever)

Pick my friends up, no destination
Drive in circles, I got no shame wit' it
Stop at the drive-in, my clique is wildin'
We all got a root beer float (Okay)
I've been coolin', I had to switch up
My bag is Italian, my top is thrift shop
No Macklemore, no Ryan Lewis (No thanks)

Let me get your number in my Sidekick, I'll call, girl
Maybe get a kiss outside that window, I've been waitin'
Root beer floats and whiskey for the first time we got faded, I, I, I

Float, float
I just hit that root beer
I just hit that root beer float
Float (Root beer float)
I just hit that root beer

No Macklemore, no Ryan Lewis
Hit that root beer
