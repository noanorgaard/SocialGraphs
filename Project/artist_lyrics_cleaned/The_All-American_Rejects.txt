The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll make you regret it


Now I'm staring at the ceiling wide awake
Man, shit gets real when you're alone
(I wonder if you'll ever know)
There's these voices in my head
They're screaming words I should've said
But I don't know
I can't let go
And you are down
Your taste was in my mouth
The lipstick on the window
You were gone

It comes and goes around
Burn your bridges down
Kiss the ground and turn the other cheek
Why don't you close your eyes one last time for me?

One last time for 

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through 

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

(Ah, ah-ah!) Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

The walls start breathin', my mind's unweavin'
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evenin'
I give the final blow

I can't explain what you can't explain
You're findin' things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain
