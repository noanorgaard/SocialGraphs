Close your eyes
Take my hand and come with me to another place
Realize, there’s a whole world outside your own, yeah
Come fly with me
Pack ya bags and don’t look back are you ready girl
You will see
The grass is greener on the other side

Baby we can
Go to the Netherlands
(We can, we can)
See the Polynesian Islands
(We can, we can)
Sail the fjords of Alaska
(We can, we can)
All the possibilities
Maybe we can
Fly to Santorini
(We can, we can)
Walk the streets of Italy
(We can, we can)
Or go to Southeast Asia
(We can, we can)
Just as long as you’re with me
Baby, we can
You might also like
Let’s go far away from home
I promise it’ll be there when we get back
And if you’re worried about
All the money we’ll spend
We don’t even really gotta fly first class
Let’s get lost in Spain
And slow dance in the Maui rain
We can do anything
Baby, just set your heart free

Close your eyes
Girl take my hand and come with me to another place
Realize, there’s a whole world outside your own, yeah
Come fly with me
Pack ya bags and don’t look back are you ready girl
You will see
The grass is greener on the other side

Go to the Netherlands
(We can, we can)
See the Polynesian Islands

Just as long as you’re with me
Baby, we can
Darling, you don’t have to
Only visit all these places in your mind
Because when life seems like a battle
There are roads we've yet to travel
Prepare for lift off, this is our time

Baby we can
Go to the Netherlands
(We can, we can)
See the Polynesian Islands
(We can, we can)
Sail the fjords of Alaska
(We can, we can)
All the possibilities
Maybe we can
Fly to Santorini
(We can, we can)
Walk the streets of Italy
(We can, we can)
Or go to Southeast Asia
(We can, we can)
Just as long as you’re with me
Everybody, sing it,
