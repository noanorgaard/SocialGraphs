We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

Come back in

I bet you light up when we start the show, follow me now
Very closely 'cause I told you so
You know we glow because we throw sun rays
Now we be freaky and we want to stay, uh

Lighting strikes, yo, we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as Dolemite
Because we're dope, kid, change like the chameleon
And the channel, whatever the whack show "Real World" is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self-made
Check the 10 from 311 in LA

We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now

Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
It comes from the down, and
We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

You wanna know what brings me here? Oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally


Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still, it's fine from afar
And you know that

Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa, I got to tell you 

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

Look at how the time flies
Burning daylight to the ground
Wash away the ashes
Gonna quiet my head down

How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keepin' me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high
But you're takin' me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

And try to keep the light within (Keep the light within)
Avoid another battle
And forget what might have been

As I w-, as I w-, as I w-, as I w-, as I w-, as I w-, as I w-
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent-made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up (Hey!), but a quick ride on down (Hey!)
And nobody here knowin' their way around
From the top of the world (Hey!), every which way is down (Hey!)
And who's gonna take the crown?

'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)

You've got to trust your instinct
And let go of regret
You got to bet on yourself now, star
'Cause that's your best bet

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
We come with the funky style that gets us known for the show
And we'll mix the hip-hop reggae if we say it is so
Fuck the naysayers 'cause they don't mean a thing
'Cause this is what style we bring, and say

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

All mixed up, you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing but the first could be the last
So just get off your ass
All mixed up, you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing but you know this will pass

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit, got to have it
Like bustin' in on a session when you got to call it quit
Sick sick bit, just can't quit
The fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit

You make me nervous, throat dry
My brain is empty, don't know why
But I saw you doin' something which is really truly nothing
And you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moons since first I saw you

And why did I try when I knew it was no? And
Why did I try when I saw it was so? But
Save it for late 'cause we should just let it skate
