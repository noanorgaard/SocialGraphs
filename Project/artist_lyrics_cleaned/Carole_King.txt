One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
Yeah, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
I sure hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
Yeah, you're so far away
Hey, you're so far away


You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will

Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will (Oh, yes I will)
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend?
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend?
Oh, yeah now
You've got a friend
Yeah, baby
You've got a friend
Oh, yeah
You've got a 

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no

(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, dah)

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too?
Still, I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it now)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

It's too late, baby
It's too late now, darlin'
It's too
