I waited patiently upon the Lord
And He inclined and heard my cry
He pulled me up out of the miry clay
He set my feet upon the Rock

He gave me beauty for ashes
And joy for my mourning
And praise for heaviness
He put a new song in my mouth and a
Crown upon my head
He gave me life forevermore

He's been
So good, so, so good to me
So good, so, so good to me
So good, so, so good to me, Jesus

So good, so, so good to me
So good, so, so good to me
