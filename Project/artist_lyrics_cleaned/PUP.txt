I'm bored of the games and bored of the chase
That's the reason I left in the first place

You keep tryna rip open old wounds
It's so embarrassing, don't you know I'm over you?

Now you wanna know where I've been lately?
You wanna know if I'm still a prick?
Well, I am and you're not gonna change me
So you got another guy goin' with you
You say you like him, but he's got a bad attitude
Well, maybe he's perfect for you!

And maybe he deserves less trouble than you gave him
Or maybe he deserves his face in the pavement

And I'm sick of it
It's so fuckin' frustrating
You're ripping open old wounds, it's embarrassing
Don't you know I'm over

Your sister thinks that I'm a freak
She's been ignorin' my calls, we haven't spoken in a week
I get so drunk that I can't speak
Yeah, nothing's workin', and our future's lookin' bleak, and I said

(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
She says that I drink too much
I'm fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up

I'm drivin' fast to get away
Doin' one-eighty on the Don Valley Parkway
Yeah, I'd be better off dead
I don't give a shit, I just don't wanna die, and I don't want to live, I said

(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up

She says that I drink too much
Fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up

I drink 'til I'm starin' at the ceilin'
I'll be just fine (I'm numb and losin' feelin')
I can't tell lies anymore
