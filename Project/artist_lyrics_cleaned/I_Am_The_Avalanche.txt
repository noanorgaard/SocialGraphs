She's a golden ticket
A shining peach mixed in a drink
That's resting on a chair in a desert land
And not a grain of sand has compromised her worth
And you're a broken man
Crawling on his hands and knees
In that same desert land
Doing the best he can not to think about
How he really needs that drink
Is this really...

Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me
Is this really happening?
The snow's actually melting in front of my face

I don't know but I've been told
That a New York winter is mighty cold
Yeah, but we still walk down the coldest blocks
Using the fire in our hearts
The way it was ain't the way it is
And that works perfectly for me
So let's keep it that way

Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me
Is this really happening?
The snow's actually melting in front of my face

This perfectly perfect disease
Has got me down on my knees
No, not to pray but just to say
I love you more than yesterday

Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me
Is this really happening?
The snow's actually melting in front of my face
Is this really happening?
The sun's finally shining down on me

Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers?
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
My dad, he said, "Son, you're looking at one."

I mention my dad because he jokes about
The times that he's had, back when he was a hippie
And how our relatives changed their names
Just to seem more American

Whatever happened to the Brooklyn Dodgers?
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to all the New York gentlemen?
My dad, he said, "Son, you're looking at one."
He said, "You're looking at one."

1 ContributorWolverines Lyrics"Wolverines"
I've had the worst day of my life
Cause you're the worst thing
That a man should have to take
Why should I even try?
What happened to the promise that we made?
This is the best day of my life
We hung out
Til the sun came crashing down
As we watch it burst
You're the best friends

1 ContributorThe Gravedigger’s Argument Lyrics
So I said
"You think you're gonna get away with this?"
You said, "I don't want to have
This fucking conversation right now."

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the snow

So you said
"You haven't changed enough and I've changed a bit."
I said, "Why do I always have to be
The one who's wide awake and you're fast asleep?"

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the snow

I won't be done with you
Yeah, until you're in a grave
Oh, what a fucking shame
Yeah, if that's what it would take
You might also like
Fucking leave
And don't forget to leave your front door key
And after that, you can find your own way
Find your own way back

Digging a ditch tonight
In my backyard
Six feet of dirt between
You and the...

Go!
