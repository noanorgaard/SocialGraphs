People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot
You might also like
The people you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them 

Said, "You can do what you want to
Whenever you want to
You can do what you want to
There's no one to stop you"

All spit and spite
You're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go
Just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car
For candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes
Full of smoldering anger
You might also like
You can do what you want to
Whenever you want to
You can do what you want to
There's no one to stop you

Now, you can do what you want to
Whenever you want to (Oh yeah)
Do what you want to
Whenever you want to (Oh yeah)
Do what you want to
Whenever you want to
Though it doesn't mean a thing
