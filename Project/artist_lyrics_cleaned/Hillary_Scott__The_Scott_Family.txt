I don't wanna think
I may never understand
That my broken heart
Is a part of Your plan
When I try to pray
All I got is hurt
And these four words

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You're good
But this don't feel good right now
And I know You think
Of things I could never think about
You might also like
It’s hard to count it all joy
Distracted by the noise
Just trying to make sense
Of all Your promises
Sometimes I gotta stop
Remember that You're God
And I am not, so

Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done like a child on my knees
All that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will

I know You see me
I know You hear me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store
I know You hear me
I know You see me, Lord
Your plans are for me
Goodness You have in store, so
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done like a child on my knees
All that comes to me is
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done

I know You see me
I know You hear me,
