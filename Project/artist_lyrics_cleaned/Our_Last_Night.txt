The mystery continues
Hundreds of feet below the ground
A treasure that cannot be found

Three men lie dead at the bottom
Questions took their lives as they tried to solve them
Ending your search for the truth
'X' marks the spot of the past that can't be caught
Where the secrets are kept, stories are left
And the safe stays locked

Head in the clouds
Can't break me now
I jumped off this plane
'Cause it was going down
My parachute
I've got nothing left to lose
The wind blows through my hair

Watching my life turn inside out (Turn inside out)
Nervous, my hands were shaking
Everything was slowly fading away
But I'll be okay

The clouds roll over the hills
And the sun begins to shine
I say goodbye to the worried ghost that was trapped inside
Set me free from the darkness that covered me

State-side bank got the right to raise
Fight the Power? Niggas'd rather light the haze
Pipe the powder – these days there's no such thing as cowards as metal fling after hours
Radio Raheem did it, trying to get TV sets and the whip tinted
Ain't finished 'til its rims around the world
Spin the wheel of fortune, tell your girl, ain't gonna be no abortion
Finally getting out the slums, kingdom come
Hell or high water, gentrification
Word of the day, here comes that court order
Move 'em in, move 'em out (x4)

Forget old man, glory's young
We got our own grass, waving in the wind, in the picnic save the sails of the slave ships
Like jailhouses rock on some back in the day
Some conglomerate stole it away
We want it today, in our own names
Before they condemn our cribs with that eminent domain
Have you living at number 37 gentrification lane
And the way words went they laughed when they say your name
On the courthouse scrolls of those who can't pay
Evicted on birthdays and anniverserariums
Now little ghetto kids think that repo men are the scary ones

From my greasy window I watch the wrecking ball swing slow-mo
Erupt white clouds, roach pulling so slow but it ain't dead
Summer time's long gone – dark days ahead
From my frozen window I watch the building grow
Mexicans moving bricks by the wheelbarrow
Cement mixer flow, po-po jumping out beating niggas in the head
Line 'em up like "Tell all you peoples this block is dead (dead understand?)"
Coming back every night
City Hall rolls up the sleeves for street fights
Overhand right got niggas confused by that bright light at the end of the tunnel
Bet your ass it's a train
Caught off guard cause they live off cocaine
Thought they wrote the rules but the game done changed
I see my landlord shaking hands with someone strange
Let me find out -
So much winter heat I don't leave the house and when I do
Faces are new, houses is gone
Like a twister came through and dropped dust in Kansas
Rent hike outlandish; I need a brew
Throw the hoodie on tough, trooper past construction sites
And the shell of a walk-up that caught fire last night
Just like the one a block over, nah mean?
That dope money dried up, half the niggas I walk past smell like gasoline
Walk in the bodega like
"Gimme the regular: newspaper, woods, and Starburst – nah, Now and Laters"
Papi laughed, said "It's all half price," smiling
"We sold the store, whole family moving to Long Island!"

I should have seen it from the start
A fake love disguised as what I wanted in my heart
It was convincing enough, it was so easy to trust
Oh, I just couldn't resist
It was the look in your eyes and the grace of your lips
You looked so different in the light that I'd been shining on you

You gave me heaven then you took it away
You let me in but you said I couldn't stay
Now my feet are back on the ground
And I'm stuck in a reality without you
(Without you, without you)
And now I'm stuck in a reality without you

And then throw it into the trunk of your car
