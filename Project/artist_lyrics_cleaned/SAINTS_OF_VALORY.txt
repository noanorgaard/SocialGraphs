Try falling apart then starting again
Been around this town for way too long
Think it's time I finally got into this song
I've got heart, got soul and some hush money
It's been a long time coming
We'll pick up the pieces as we go
It's been a long time coming
We'll pick up the pieces as we go
It's been a long time coming
So go ahead and walk while I start running
It's been a long time coming
I apologize early for the rush
Blame it on these late nights keeping me up
I hear the sun shines bright in Paris and Rome
I'll slip away before you found out that my cover is blown
I walked out just right before you walked in
It's been a long time coming
We'll pick up the pieces as we go
It's been a long time coming
We'll pick up the pieces as we go
It's been a long time coming
I'll share with you my secrets while you share some skin
Call it a draw
Again and again
So go ahead and walk while I start running
It's been a long time coming
You might also likeSo go ahead and stop me before I begin
I'll drive until the sun wears me down thin
So go and heed your call and I'll heed my warning
It's been a long time
