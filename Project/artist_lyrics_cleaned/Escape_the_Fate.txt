So I'll hang on, never let go
I dug this pain into my chest. It's dead

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose, so let me tell you the truth

A deadly wish but it should've come sooner
A corpse in a funeral that I would never attend
There is a light on in the back of this house
But you're not around, to die is to live in her head

So I'll hang on, never let go

So, this goes
Out to the ones that fall in love
And to the girl
That filled my dark

Last night, I had the weirdest dream
That you and I drove up the darkest street
(Always felt it, never had it. Always felt it, never had it)
Passing through these city lights
(Always felt it, never had it. Always felt it, never had it)
Closure for the kids that died

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove

If you had class you'd throw down with me
Drown in your fake personality
Shattered glass and frames
(Shattered glass and frames)
Snapshots of reality
Burnt pictures and memories
Your heart's cold and grey

To whom it may concern
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
I'm the same
And all that I've learned
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
Has faded away

Can you tell me
(All the lies that you have said)

So keep on lying
(Just keep on lying to me)
I find less beauty in life than death

Has faded away
I know that the blood still stains
And I don't feel the same
Go!
As you're falling down
(As you're falling down)
My heart beats the same
And the tears now (tears now)
(And the tears now)
Run down your face

To whom it may concern

And all that I've learned

Before I die, I will have seen it all
The mountains I have climbed help me enjoy the fall

Oh, the webs you weave, we are caught in the fame
The passion's dead, the life you've led
Has drowned in your shame
Oh, the webs I weave, I am caught in this game
My passions' dead, the life I've led
Has drowned me in vain

So paint my portrait the colors of my life
And the untold stories are painted in black and white
I can hear the footsteps that follow to my pulse
This paranoia has haunted me like a ghost

Before I die, I will have seen it all

I'm killing time, let me go
Before I die (I will have seen it all)
It reads their minds, brings them close
Before I die (I will have seen it all)

Oh, the webs you weave, we are caught in the fame
The passion's dead, the life you've led
Has drowned in your shame

Brother, put your needles down
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed
If you see mother, tell her I can sing

Please don't worry, I am doing fine
You're much too busy to even find the time
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave
The boys you left are men you didn't raise

And daddy, how are you today?
You must be proud of the boys that you have raised
Your withered heart, and everything it's seen
Your cuts and calloused hands, you had kids to feed

The battled starts adversaries
We bathe in our blood
The worst is yet to come
We've reached the covenant
To kill what we have started
Kill the machines
We've spawned to fight in the darkest hour

They really need to know
We really gotta go
(We fight to live, we fight for pride)
They really need to know
(We won't back down, the weak won't survive)
We really gotta go

We stay here tonight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
Promise me you won't leave my side
(The warmest place to lie my head)
And when the sun comes up, we fight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
So promise me you won't leave my side

You say you're getting closer to last chance of suicide
Tearing at your throat you won't let it die
Left me here for all these days and ripped apart my pride

Take my place and look inside
Try to find a place to hide, hide
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide
Yeah, all right

Living on the coast cocktails and telling lies
Got a fucking curse that's coming to life
You left me here for all these days and ripped apart my pride

Take my place and look inside
Try to find a place to hide, hide
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide
It's not to late, I'm close behind
I've gotta get inside your mind, mind
Lost my faith but don't you cry
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide
