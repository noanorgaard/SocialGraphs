I don't know why I love you
I just know I can't stop thinking of you
Oh wait, it's cause you make me smile
You always make me smile

I like that rainbow pair
Of gym shoes that you wear
I like the chance you take
I like the mess you make


I like that rainbow pair
Of gym shoes that you wear
I like the way you sing
And when you dance with me
You might also like
I like the face you make
And when you dance with me
I like the rules you break
And when you dance with me

I like the cake you bake
And when you dance with me
I like the chance you take
So won't you dance with me
