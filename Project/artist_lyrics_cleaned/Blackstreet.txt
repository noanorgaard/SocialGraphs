Lately, I've been thinking something's going wrong
Cause you got an attitude
And you're not in the mood, like you used to
Girl I can feel it when I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
Can I be the one to blame?

I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna say bye-bye
True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine
And mine (Before I let go)

Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

Listen baby, turn the lights down low, let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We make sweet love baby; I know you feel it, too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I'm so certain of

I don't wanna lose your love (Don't wanna lose ya)
I don't wanna say bye bye (Don't wanna lose ya)
It's always the little things
I remember and I can't just let it slip away
Slip away (before)

Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

Teddy, won't you play the music for me
Teddy, won't you play
Blackstreet say
(Don't wanna lose ya)
Baby I get so lonely sometimes, I
(Don't wanna lose ya)
Baby my heart is broken sometimes
I need you right now, I don't
Don't wanna loose ya
I can't let you slip away, slip away
Before I let go

Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight?

Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?
I don't want lose your sweet love
So don't say goodbye, say 

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
Said, 'I don't mind but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance, on the floor, in around?" (No, No, No diggity)
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in around (No, No, No diggity)
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance, on the floor, in around (No, No, No diggity)

People always told me, "be careful what you do
Don't go around breakin young girls' hearts"
And mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, because a lie become the truth"
Hey, yeah

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No diggity, no doubt about it)
She said I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, No, No, no diggity)

For forty days and for forty nights I was on the scene
But who could stand when she's in demand her schemes and blames
Gonna dance, on a floor, in around, (No, No, No, diggity)
So take my strong advice:
Just remember to always think twice (No)
Don't think twice (Don't think twice, hoo)
She told my baby imagined free and she looked at me
And showed a photo of a baby cry his eyes were like mine
So we danced, on a floor, in around (No, No, No diggity)
(The bridge)

People always told me, "be careful what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
But she she came and stood right by me
And I smelled her sweet perfume
It happend much too soon
She called me to the room, hey, yeah
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (The kid is not my son)
She said I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, No, no diggity)
(Oh, no no no, Billie Jean, yeah)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Oh no)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
