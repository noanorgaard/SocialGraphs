Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin' to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin' you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show
(It's just a show) Ooh-oh

There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad
Hurtin' so bad (Tears of a clown)
Cryin' all the 

People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, look a little bit closer, and it's easy to trace
Oh, the tracks of my tears
Oh, I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

Hey, yeah
(Outside) I'm masquerading
(Inside) My hope is fading
(Just a clown) Ooh yeah, since you put me down
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you

Baby, take a good look at my face
Ah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, just look closer, and it's easy to trace
Oh, the tracks of my tears, baby, baby
Baby, take a good look at my face
Ooh yeah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
Yeah, the tracks of my tears, oh, yeah
Baby, take a good look at my face, 

Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain, so don't be blue
'Cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be, yeah
Yeah, so, baby, straighten up, come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe, yeah

I said, now, baby baby don't cry
Baby, baby, here's why
Love is here standin' by
Love is here standin' by

You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of

Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad, but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realised that tear-filled eyes
Can never stop him now, no, no, no
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now, yeah

Oowee now, baby, baby, don't cry, no, no
Baby, baby, here's why
Because love is here standin' by
I say love is right here standin' by

All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope, girl, love is strength
Here's someone standin' right beside ya who would go to any lengths
To give you love, true and deep
And help you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

So, ooh, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Don't you cry now, oh, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Let me tell you why, now (Baby baby here's why)
Don't you know that
Love is here standin' by
I say love is right here standin' by
Your tears are shed in vain, I said
So (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Come on, dry your eyes, baby (Baby, baby, don't cry)
Don't you realise, baby (Baby, baby, here's why)
You don't have to cry, because
Love is
