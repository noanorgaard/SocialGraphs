Never bring sand to the beach, when you never even seen that shore
There's plenty more fish in the sea, so why would I swim with yours
I tell her what it is, she respect it because it's me, and I'ma swim in it talking ten feet deep
Ain't nobody gotta know, we just keep it low-key
But if they ask if that's me, I look back like
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ma I get it in, but never been a player
Fisherman Pell so sometimes I just filet em
Keep em guessing where I’m staying unless they known the kid from day one
Taking slim bait leaving whales inside the ocean (I'm lying)
Jameson in my gills got me drunk in love
But it Only last a minute or until I bust
16 when my uncle took me fishing, but little did I know id hook the prettiest of women (for real)
Now I'm in my twenties and my lines the cause of interest
Now I'm tossing shells at my fucking competition
Saving sand dollars just to throw em at the women
Definition of a feel good living
In the waves all night
I could stay all night
Just for one my type
But until I find her I'm a keep swimming

Situation's elevated since our loving needed saving
See that you all down the street, you just wanted affirmation
I was on the other line, but still miss your conversation
Guess I answered hoping you would say you're staying
A picture's worth a thousand words
So let me paint the scene with a thousand verbs
That we never followed through
Stick together for the kids
But the mud got deep when the dirt got thick

And how can you amend the pain
That saw you out the frame
Evading all the history
It's time to runaway

Out in the cold you told me you would be fine
Now you're alone, struggling for a place to call home
And I'm there, not a minute late
Another runaway, we need to run away

Situation's elevated since she came to you with anguish
Cause her knight in shining armor lost his lustin' through relations
With the grief inside her voice, can't sing 'Amazing Grace's
When the sorrow seems like it's made for you, you runaway
Children gone on weekends, barely see them on the holiday
Wonder if anyone even know it's Father's Day
Cause the love don't live it no more
Had to gallop down the road, 'fore she beat a dead horse
Kept it short

Out in the cold you told me you would be fine
Now you're alone, struggling for a place to call home
And I'm there, not a minute late
Another runaway, we need to run away

Out in the cold you told me you would be fine
Now you're alone

Out in the cold you told me you would be fine
Now you're alone, struggling for a place to call home
And I'm there, not a minute late
