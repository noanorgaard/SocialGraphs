Alright
Ugh, ugh, ugh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Mama taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
If you step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it don't give a fuck
Pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel, we had females coming every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately, I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent nigga, shit
Bitch
Yeah

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote (Yeah)
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Mama taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga
My fleeting thoughts on a leash for the moment
High as fuck, I've been alone in my shit for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs riding in 'em
I'm a target, so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight
Like a collar when you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama
Find a bottle, I'ma wallow and I lie in that
Um, I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back


My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album crackin' to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off!)
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, I'm takin' no advice, nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish, and I'm stressin' over payment (Cut that bitch off!)
So don't tell me that I made it, only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado, misfitted, I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable, (I'm not stable) abrasive as fuck and they all (Cut that bitch off!)
Pay me, I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racin' 'til blunt is lit, (Like he don't give a fuck again, right?)

"Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga? I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga. I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em."

I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judgin' by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga (Cut that bitch off!)
Night life livin'
Ridin' in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it (Cut that bitch off!)
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga
You see that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that, nigga (Cut that bitch off!)See Earl Sweatshirt LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also 

Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse
Shorty I’m pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it
I’m in that kitchen, wrist water whippin' work (Psych!)
Nigga, I don’t do that
Niggas get bloop-blapped and blown away
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks, like, "Órale!"
Okay, I’m onto something
Momma should've told you it’d be days like this
It’s just a tale from the crip
I’m on my séance shit, I’m tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby mama to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch
A lot of lotto picks lost inside this game we call rap
I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his underarm
Ain’t nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby-mama killer, you offended, and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doing federal time for busting at the law
And he gon' be a neighbor of mine, you play me for a pawn
Shawty, I be swimming with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen when the pastor say

It's Golf on that— Bitch, it's Golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tallboy, Jehovah ain’t call back
And y’all still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy (Nigga)
Peanut butter to paisley
Walking down the street in the different-color McGradys
That first-grader was me
Now, my fist full of spliffs and the old banker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
I’m taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my mama, I been limiting my features, filling Swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him, like a soft dick
Golf clique deep, and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas, and Shreddy K brought the matches
Pitch your body in the water like a Lipton teabag
And then switch to a different fucking whip to let them piggies speed past him
It's the rats, tryna get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou—if I'm on the track, these niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
Fifties in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gon' pop it when it’s danger 'round
Fingertips to tapers now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making 

'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrockin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

From a city that's recession-hit
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

Quit with all that tough talk
Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down
Bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real
Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwin' out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm gettin' money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein'
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't trippin' long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas sprayin' K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain
Like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin',
