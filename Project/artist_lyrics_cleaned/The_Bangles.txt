I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (Burning) an eternal (Eternal) flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feelin', oh

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around, and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (Oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian


Slide your feet up the street, bend your back

'Cause that's my fun day (Ooh-oh)
My I-don't-have-to-run day (Ooh)
It's just another manic Monday

Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon, honey, let's go make some noise" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)
