When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer
When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
(Summer, summer, summer, summer)
Golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be alright
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?"
So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone, in the summer"

The men all played along to marching drums
And, boy, did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, (Hey!) so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to God
Yes, we're all too smart to talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch
Sprouting suns and ageless daughters

Don't you know, don't you know
That those watermelon smiles
Just can't ripen underwater?

You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells, and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

Don't try and sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
Yeah, we're splashing around
And the news spread all over town
I'm not complaining that it's raining
I'm just saying that I'd like it a lot more than you'd think
If the sun would come out and sing with me

Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, so our matching legs are marching clocks
And we're all too small to talk to God, yes, we're all too smart to talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs to us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak, through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch, sprouting suns and ageless daughters
Those watermelon smiles just can't ripen underwater, just can't ripen underwater

The men all played along to marching drums
And boy did they have fun, behind the sea
They sang, so our matching legs are marching clocks

All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (Hallelujah!)

My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (Over it)

I was drunk and it didn’t mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (Over it ohhhhh)

No one wants you when you have no heart and
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
