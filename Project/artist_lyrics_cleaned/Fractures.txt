It's alright, It's alright
You see the fault lines, started panicking
It's alright, It's alright
You confide in the low light, you're so kind
You're caught up in the crossfire
It's alright, It's alright

Don't get dragged through
Don't be consumed
Don't catch it through
Don't be consumed

Get out the tight robes
Keep your eyes closed
Let her know you're falling
Follow your shadow
Lost count of the dice rolls
And the man hoes fighting in the morning
Acting like you don't know
You might also like
Don't get dragged through
Don't be consumed
Don't catch it through
Don't be consumed

It's alright, It's alright
It's alright, It's alright
It's alright, It's alright
It's alright, It's
