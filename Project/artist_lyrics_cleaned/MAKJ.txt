1 ContributorKagerou Project Song Medley Lyrics{Children Record begins}

Turning on my headphones I smile to the side
And flash a secret sign to run through the night
With a single knock upon that empty door
All the heat built up and we couldn't take it anymore

"Still hiding, averting both your eyes?"
As you struggle in a stare, how it burns inside
When I tumble down there's a tune in my mind
Rise again and take my hand and we'll soar on out into the sky

There's pain in the light
So much that there's some who'd rather leave it all bеhind
We're stuck in a system, thе game is fixed
And if I nod my head the world will struggle to exist

Boys and girls come step on ahead
And brave the heat that nobody ever wanted
"Bring it back again, bring it back again"
The crimson moon is suffocating flaming red and

Head on out to the real world you've never known
Come grab your guns, to war we go!
{Jinzou Enemy begins}

When living only to draw out your breath
Why repeat the every day and live a life where nothing is left?
Such a pretty thing to keep saying

Misguided love for the distant and fake
As your fingers type away the ever dimming light of the day
Even though your lips are void of a voice or a phrase

The silhouettes lacking name or a face
Yet it's only with them that you seem to find a place
But then again you know as well as I they can't feel the same

That's just the way that it goes
Yet again the day draws to a close
You carelessly try and fake you're alive
And crumble into sleep in the night
Ahh, it's so lame it seems
So you turned away with pain in your eyes
Even though your gaze is still reflecting all the light
Hey, if you choose to live
And to turn from the world that left you behind
Why then are you looking at me emptily
Like I am the enemy
Silently from behind the screen?

Living a life like this isn't what you should do
I know you know that you're hurting too
To drown away in the darkest of days
Surely fills you up with grief that's so agonizing
And if the world we're seeing is more than a lie
Then tell me, what kind of phrase is right?
Come take my hand and I'll follow your lead
To a world of artificiality
{Mekakushi Code begins}

This cold world without a hint of hope
Is growing heavy too much to fly or follow
You claw, importing with each mistake, left with nothing to show
The iPhone within my pocket rings In a code that will start the tired story
My headphones, the world is deaf to me, With just a flip of the hood I’m away and out of reach

No problem, the perfect mask is complete
Stuck in a system, and we’ll never leave
The whole town, it floods with red all around, As the night bursts in perfect melody

Strange it seems, today was meant to be
Yet the world is ignoring all our harmony
Life it seems is just anxiety
As the dawn carries on ever breaking the peace
Come now are you quitting out on me?
If you take in the beat you’ll see it’s deafening
Rise up through the pain eternally
Unite ‘till we’re finally free

Swallow down all of your pride and need
And break away to the right to where we’re meeting
If your heart is beating fast in heat
Flash a grin and from all of your troubles you’ll be free

The hot trends are cut and burned by wit
I take the lead and run out to where you’re calling
It might suck but now I’m used to it
Just duck away from their eyes hiding blind until you win

It’s alright, keep up the mission as planned
Just 20 minutes, don’t regret or look back
So lace up, this time get ready to run, Strike a pose, there’s the signal, attack!

If the heat is burning at the seams
We can skip through the pass and keep on smoldering
Bank a left the city’s up ahead
And beyond to the dawn you are starting again
“Hey hey, tell me that we’re getting close”
Our heel cries out while laughing down below
Sadly I can’t say quite that I know
Take my hand to the ending we go
{Kagerou Daze begins}

August 15th at 12 afternoon
Not a single cloud had stained the sky so bright and blue
Such a mellow hue

Those days with nothing to do I had sat within the park so calmly next to you
And swaying to and fro we had chatted softly burning through our youth

“But I’m done… I really hate the summer sun.”
You said and softly pet a cat you found
On the streets of the town looking down on your luck

Ah, the cat had broken from your arms
And chasing after it you found yourself In the street there as well As the traffic lights had showed that you had gone too far

Suddenly the streets were painted red
As I screamed at the stain that used to be my friend
Sweet you had smelled to me now blood dripping agony
It strangled my mind and every thought intensely
Haze of lies sunk deep so far beneath the eyes
Turned and laughed as the clouds had covered the sky
Cries of cicadas now had died in their final bow
The world around me was twisted as I broke out

Worn out in my bed I had woke
From a dreadful sleepless night more real than I know
Where’d the hours go?

August 14th at 12 afternoon
Not a single cloud had stained the sky so bright and blue
My mind was shaken to the core by cicadas loudly singing out of tune

But you know, is all this really how it goes?
It was just yesterday, I had a really strange kind of dream of us two on this road

No, I think it’s time we’re going home
And then the second that we turned around
On the street going down
There were screams as something fell upon us running bellow

All around the pipes they all were falling down
As they broke through your body pressed into the ground
Chimes of a summer day had mixed with the ripping pain
The screams and the agony I couldn’t burn away
Laughing on as if it all was just a game
As his eyes shining bright pierced deftly through the haze
Light fading out of sight I turned to what’s left behind
The thought alone there had given me a peace of mind
{Headphone Actor begins}

Another boring day that ends the same
There’s not a thought or a lie that could get in my way
I turned the radio on to drown the dull in a song
But something else echoed through that was certainly wrong

“It’s truly sad to say, but right here today”
“The very world that we know soon will crumble away”
So said some tired official, tears in his eyes
He bowed his head in regret as he pitifully cried

And beating out of the window, a raging flock of birds
Their cries consuming the sky more with every word
The very moon and the stars all faded in obscurity, aimlessly

Stuck in the midst of a game without time to save
A boring book from the school that just rots away
And though it never could stop clawing in my brain
I throw my headphones on anyway

And as my indie album plays out
A nameless song they made that I play so loud
Just as the chorus hit in my ears it resounds
“Are you gonna go on dying now?”

And waving over all of this world distorted
The buildings seemed to shift and to tremble contorted
And the voice I knew, I had known it for certain
It’s truly my own I sighed out as I then heard it
“And if you cross the hill there in twenty seconds”
You’ll see just for yourself all the truth that I meant that summer day
Don’t avert your eyes, come close and listen tight
There’s only twenty seconds of time
{Souzou Forest begins}

The breeze of summer knocks at my door
And I reach out the window to find
The little chirps from the birds that echo as they sing in the sky
I put my half-read book to the side
And with a smile ask, “Oh from where have you flew?”
Wearing my blindfold I knew it was still only 3 afternoon

This world is plain and simple it seems
Yes I know that it’s me who is strange
I’m just a monster that nobody gets and this will not ever change
Deep in the woods hidden out of their view
There is a house that was made to keep me from their sight
And surely that’s why nobody would ever dream of stopping by

Don’t show them your eyes!
I shut my heart and my mind
Cause all alone is all how I can live my life
With every day seeing only these things in this house at my side
All my dreams they all come from the books that I read
So if I dream a world that I never will see
Would you forgive those childish thoughts of mine please?

Softly said it had followed me
Within this crazy world that I was born into
There was life inside me
Ever so faintly beating
Tell me out in that world so wide
Is there a future that I dream one day will come find me?
Today I’ll wait again. One day I’m sure it’ll knock at my door

Finding me alone hid away down and cowering
The person looked on with such surprising eyes
“If you look my way then your body turns to stone.”
I said shaking, but they just smiled back
“All throughout my life I’ve been scared of living too”
So scared like I had been frozen into stone
“But hey don’t you think our world would be so much brighter”
“If we weren’t so scared to go?”

Ringing out was a sound so bright
My heart was filled with such imagination
Of what that world would be like
Its pounding had echoed inside
Tell me you who could bring me there
What sort of future for us both is out and waiting?
If I get lost my friend
I hope you’ll come and you’ll find me again

The breeze of summer calls out again
It gently blows back the hood you had gave
And then I smiled as ever so gently it danced and it swayed
{Konoha no Sekai Jijou begins}

Countless dreams and wills and lives all building no end in sight
Came together through the hate letting me come alive
Nothing more than just a jolting and erratic thing without a light

Here’s the story of a boy that tripped and stumbled it seems
With each and every single chapter crying out as it screams
“Let me see you again” he had called through the heat

A final bet made to risk it all
Within this man-made jungle
Was trudging along without a care
For who or what was left behind again
So if it’s so then why, wouldn’t they give it up I’ve had enough
That was the fate they had shared, the kids in the summer air
This town that was twisted had no solace anywhere

There at the end against what anyone had thought or hoped
Time it had seemed had stopped my body and I let go
Dreams and our futures crumble sadly away in the traffic speeding coming close
Pulling out this body from the world he never wanted
Far into a future dyed in leave that were falling red
The serpent had said
All the rays of sun and all the painful screams had vanished
With August passing by in the summer repeating
All I ever wanted was a future where the two of them could smile again
Somewhere I know against what anyone had thought or hoped
Rain had poured on down without a care for those down below
Oh back in those days, yes back in the days
{Kisragi Attention begins}

Wo-oh I wonder where I’m going to go
Dunno if wearing normal clothes’ working
Ahh, whatever I choose every road sets me up to lose

Wo-oh if I’m wearing my heel shoes
It’s so confusing just to walk on along
So I’ll flip my hood on up and carry on
Keep myself far out of their thoughts

Out through the shops and allies averting my eyes
Ahh, man my heart is beating more with every feeling
But then the wind it blows exposing my face, crowd is looking my way
The cheering voices calling my name
I guess I didn’t really need a peaceful kind of weekend anyway

It’s so bad I wanna give up, sure I guess I’m loved by everyone
But their gaze is just making me blue
Don’t know what to do, they’re noticing too
It’s so bad I wanna give up
Something that I felt no matter what
“Please stop looking and turning!”
But I took all the words and pocketed them away

Wo-oh for ever since I could recall
I go and turn the gaze of all
And you know that’s just how it goes
I’ve grow up so used to that troublesome flow

Wo-oh I’ve heard it all so often before
Although I can’t seem to recall man but
Ahh, “everything sucks” I hate it so much
But never could I freely just let it go

Panic consumes the streets as they run and cry
Man it all makes me want to give up give up on idol
“If I could be that kinda girl that you see”
It all was stupid of me cause everything had turned out poorly
I planned and dreamed but now it seems
That shining light just wasn’t meant to be

It’s so bad I wanna give up, sure I guess I’m loved by everyone
Am I really as good as they say?
It’s all such a pain, stop looking my way
It’s so bad don’t look in my eyes
But all of my words were locked inside
“God you’re making me cry now”
But I took all the words and pocketed them away

You can’t keep on hating yourself
Everyone is cheering, can’t you tell?
Everything that you ever had dreamed
And every belief is all in your reach
If it’s bad then change it again
You should know you’re not alone my friend
Just take a breath and then let’s move on ahead

Ah, I think that maybe I can!
I can feel my heart beat as I laugh
Overflowing with every note
So give me your heart and off we’ll go
For this dream I shared by your side
Filled to burst it finally beats alive
So don’t cover your eyes now
Through tomorrow and now together we’ll figure out
{Gunjou Rain begins}

Crying out through another sleepless night
I had read you a story by your side
The falling rain around in the twilight

“Read to me once again tomorrow please”
By the time that the bookmark was in the seams
You my dear there were resting ever gently

You had said that you want to see the world
It’s a phrase that I long had always heard
And it’s not that I hate it but that you must learn

And it’s truly a feeling I detest
All the pain that is welling in my chest
I say I’m sorry time on and again

Out there is a world that sputters on without regard
Every little little life that takes it in while never knowing
Don’t look in their eyes
That rule we decide was made so that one day
You might rise above through all the pain And see the life that’s out and waiting

I hated all that happened
This world that only laughed and
Before I even knew it you taught of love and then
I hope that through tomorrow
Through all the tears and sorrow
You meet someone to reach and take your hand to gently follow and
Simply the thought draws the tears out from my eyes
And I could only hope that soon that day might come in time, love
{Yobanashi Deceive begins}

Bebop to the beat inside
As the night consumes the streets so greedily
Off beat let it break and shine
Setting free the bitter thoughts inside of me
Hey, how ‘bout a little tale?
From this stupid mess of broken tragedy
Hold back but to no avail
It’ll be well worth the price, let’s be swallowed by the beat

Well, how ‘bout a little chat?
There’s a hidden part of me you’ll never see
Act normal and all of that
But my heart’s still rushing fast so easily
Ten years that I bit the fruit
And the serpent dug its fangs inside of me
Consumed by a bitter truth
Cries of spite to lie were all that’s guiding me

Since that time my heart’s been stained by the lies
There’s not a single soul that ever knew or saw what’s inside
But that’s only right, cause I’m a monster in kind
Ah, don’t you cry, all of the answers are lies, Off somewhere deeper then you’ll find

Oh my dirty, how disgusting
I deceive them all again
That’s what I say, but all the same, this sinking feeling remains
Keep believing what you want to as I pile up the lies and
Acting cruelly day again I’ll be there laughing on the side

Bebop to the girl who hides
From the flames that burn the night so bitterly
Off beat to the boy who cries
As he runs from all their thoughts so pitifully
Well not like I’m one to talk
Far beyond the hero’s dream I’m tumbling
Heart shattered by what I saw
Far too late our feet were meekly stumbling

If that dream we shared would simply come to be
Could I be freed from all the loneliness that’s strangling me?
"Are you kidding me?"
No I’m as true as can be!
This rotting brain that’s always stinging with pain Is quickly splitting at the seams

Oh my dirty, listen closely to this coward’s beating heart
A selfish face, that’s seeped in pain, the only “me” that remains
Though I say I’m really lonely nothing’s ever gonna change
It’s so disgusting but my face is softly laughing all the same

Oh my dirty, I despise it, let these feelings all be heard
This coward’s face, that played the game
Might not be one we can save
Simply shrugging off your problems only proves you’ll never change
“Oh my, how careless”
Time I wasted cause this liar is still off out and laughing with my face
{Lost Time Memory begins}

If I’m smart then I’ll quit on looking forward
And rot away ‘cause I care no longer
How nice it’d be if my life could be just as before

Years pass by as I live without an exit
And whisper prayers though I never meant it
Because I know that they can’t reach you ears anymore

“I just don’t care, if I die, let me die!” while sighing faintly
Grabbing at my wrist just to curse it
If I can't change the past then I’ll just indulge in this life that I had forfeit
“In this summer of dreams take me back into the past to”
“Memories that you were still with me”
Pitiful days I hid my eyes are igniting in the sky
And are burning up the back of my mind

Boy, 18, had prayed so kindly
And stood up “then” to face his memory
The summer smile I longed to see again
Is here it never leaves me
“Been so long… I died, I’m sorry”
“Though now this time I won’t go blindly”
Don’t leave me now to drown in dreams your light is all I need
The silhouettes were watching on as I at last was finally free
{Ayano's Theory of Happiness begins}

The memories come back to me, The ones I had loved and called my family
“Ayano look, you’re a sister now so try to help them all along and make them happy”

As the winds had blown on by, that adult world had grown so bitter
There was something out of place as the happiness slowly withered
Hiding in their loneliness, all those that I had loved stayed out of sight
Keeping all the pain inside as my world faded to night

My life had lost its hue, I never knew
And couldn’t tell a single soul the truth now
“Stop it, stop the pain, just let things stay the same.”
In came a world where the happiness crumbled away

Oh madder crimson, I’m begging, take anything
To save that small band of heroes and life that they’re living
I thought through all the weeping, the tears that I shed
And hid the pain as I smiled once again
I wonder if I, had red eyes, just maybe could I
Manage to fight all the suffering and take back their future
I’m dumb and awkward, but yet even so
This is the mission I will take alone
{Outer Science begins}

Dripping of misery and sickening sin
All the dead men are knocking on the world that you live
Helpless the mistress kindly welcomes them in
“This story makes me sick”

Stretching the throat so you can swallow the mind
Melt the hearts that the tortured souls are leaving behind
Slowly consuming every drop of their life
And gouging out the eyes

Hey, this is the choice you wanted to make
So keep on struggling and don’t you run away
Glare at the eyes and fight cause now you’re playing my game
All of you fools just never change
Time, time, again, you die in vain
Now it’s starting again, the tale is reaching its end
With all your beautiful bodies, twisted, crying, howling, broken

Ah what an ugly sight you are
Begging for reason, don’t you start
Life it wasn’t enough, you take whatever you touch
This empty miracle now is suffocating in its blood and
“This is too much for me to take”
Sobbing again at each mistake
Light is starting to fade, yes every end is the same
Back to the following, following, story
Following, following, more the
Following, following, following, end where I’ll wait
{Marry's Fictional World begins}

Those same old voices, that same old scenery
Without trying or wishing it seems they leave my heart at peace
We’re still repeating, tomorrow still out of reach
But still somehow though same it may seem it felt so new to me

“Stop all the pain, that is burning our days”
As you closed your eyes so pitifully in shame
The orange dying the sky, all the tears I ever cried
Eagerly wish and pray that still one day from red we may escape

Hey you know, through tomorrow and the world that comes to be
All I need, all I wanted to see was you smiling with me
And I know, when the ending comes I’ll surely just repeat
So that once upon tomorrow we could see the sky in peace
So that once upon a dream we all might finally be free
{Summertime Record begins}

The weather’s nice today as well, we gather round and stare up at the clouds
These lazy days it’s hard to tell, we close our eyes and fall down to the ground
A distant blurry memory, those days long gone seem so hard to recall
Cause time goes on relentlessly, we’ve grown too old to see it all
Ahh…

We played with fake maturity, made secret plans just to burn out the day
“We fight this war eternally” and joined our hands just to find our own way
The strange, it seemed, came naturally, us lonely kids had no means to resist
The meaning never came to me. My fleeting heart, it grew amiss
Part through the grass and charge on through the day
Glare at the sun through hazy rays
Stretching a hand you had said so kind, “If you are lonely then come join the fight!”

Even the thoughts that were born in those days, knocking away at the future we’d shape
Start to collapse and fade away from memory, was it all a dream we had made?

We gather at the secret base, recall those happy summer days
That simple time, it comes to mind, let’s tell our stories that way
The jet stream soars across the sky, “It’s all so bright” we laughed and cried
What kind of face was yours back then?
I don’t know why but I can’t seem to recall

The painful dark reality, had come so fast while we burned out our days
A common pace for you and me, but any second could crumble away
These extra days pass freely by. Even adults can be scared to go on
By now we’ve finally realized there’s more to life than being strong

Thoughts circle round in this world filled with light
Withering sun that burns the sky
Whispers the words of a hazy place
“Don’t you forget your pain, walk all the same.”
Walking ahead we’d impatiently wait, dreaming each time of tomorrows we’d make
No going back, but to the world ahead of us
“All of it is ours to go change.”

“But all those days are over now, our secret base and time we shared.”
We all were lost but soon had found, our friends and stories were there
Those lonely kinds all joined in hands day after day and made their plan
“No matter what road lies ahead… we all will meet again.”

“Refreshing” we all laugh and say, as all the clouds had cleared away
We breath it in, try not to cry, and smile through our “goodbyes”
We gather at the secret base and laugh through another summer day
“Remember all that time somewhere and we will meet so I will draw it again”
We won’t
