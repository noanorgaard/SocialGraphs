Winter is cold, oh
But you're colder still
And for the first time
I feel like you're mine
I share you with the one who will
Mend what falls apart
And turn a blind eye
To the thief of your heart

Ohhh, you lost
Ohhh. you lost all
You lost all
You lost all

I'll never wash these clothes
I want to keep the stain
Your blood to me is precious
Nor would I spill it in vain
Your spirit sings
Though your lips never part
Singing only to me
The thief of your heart
You might also like
Ohhh, you lost
Ohhh, you lost
Ohhh, you lost all
Lost all
Ohhh, you lost
Ohhh, you lost all
Lost 

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do," but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
You might also like

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to
