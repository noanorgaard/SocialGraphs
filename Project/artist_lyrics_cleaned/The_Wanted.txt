You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came

When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say
"This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died"

Hey, everybody's got a dream
So what do you say, are we making history?

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own the night)
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own)

For tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm king
And I will be remembered for centuries, they'll say
"This man was a hero, a hero of the night
When he was at a party, the party never died"

Hey, I'm a little drunk
But I got something to say (Hold your jars)

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
And let us wake up inside a stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night, my friends, we will not forget
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own the night)
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own)
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
