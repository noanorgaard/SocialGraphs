I'm awake, I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life
Here (Right here), right now (Right now)
Stand my ground and never back down
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive

I'm at war with the world, 'cause I
Ain't never gonna sell my soul
I've already made up my mind
No matter what, I can't be bought or sold
When my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in
You breathe into me again

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

My secret side I keep, hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out (He'll tear me up, break me down)
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end
