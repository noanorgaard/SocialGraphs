Backpack girl wanna fight? That's a clapback
Boy, last night was a flashback
Look at my back
Hit or take when I show that
Walk in the room, gimme that
Yeah, I be on that, don't get mad 'fore I call that
Fall back, you was never ever all that
Should've had a map
Would've known what you looked like
'Fore I hit you back, ya!
On my Jimmy Choo's
I can't mess wit you
You a thot, you a nasty youth
Shoulda flexed on you
I got chemicals, on my visuals
You're so lyrical
Never catch me hanging with some typicals
Hey! Ya!

Boom boom, pop pop, took him in the drop
Thumbing through a check while I'm running through the block
Just took a man 'cause her breath got hot
Sittin' at the top, pop pop pop
Drop it like it's hot
A man gon' come, don't be a dum-dum
Running for his cash, take it to the max
Shoes in a bag, don't ask for a tab
Money money money all I see and I dab
Money, checks drop, all they do is they 
Bumping them gums, like all I do is rap
Girl get back, ratta-tat-tat
Runnin' through a chant
Like hot boys trap, sittin' on a couch like I needa take a nap
Cookin' them snacks
Yum yum in my tum tum
Stole her man, now run, run! (run)
I can steal her man, I can steal her man
She ain't think I can, she ain't think I can
I can steal her man, I can steal her man
She ain't think I can, can, think I can

Ya, hey, don't fall, sleep
Ya, hey, steal her man, steal her
