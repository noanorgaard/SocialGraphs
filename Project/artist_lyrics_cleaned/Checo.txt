1 ContributorContradictions Lyrics
Friday night, all alone, I'm
Killing time, on my phone, I
Wonder where she is right now
Where, the good girls go when the sun goes down
Well it's cool now
I'm just seeking the truth now
I don't mean to be rude, but
I'll just keep to myself

Oh, the contradictions
Of who we are
And who we wanna be
Know yourself

Now she's out in CAliforn-I-A
Tryin' to be somebody
And she bought what they sold
But she can't go broke
She's gotta heart of gold
She's just an angel
Living in the City of Angels
Living with her heart so tangled, and
And ever since lights came true
She's gotta million things to prove
You might also like
Oh, the contradictions
Of who we love
And who we wanna love
Love yourself

'Cause I've been down on my luck
I'm down on my soul
Looking for love, out of control, right now
Don't give a fuck
All in my zone, in my own world
Chasing things I think I deserve
All the pretty girls have options baby
You're gonna be fine
How to believe to things I can't hold in my hands
Love

I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout all these things we used to do
I've found a new religion
And you've got a new man, (right)
Let's burn down all these bridges
And work on a new plan
Oh, the contradictions
Of where we are
And where we wanna be
Trust yourself

'Cause I've been down on my luck
I'm down on my soul
Looking for love, out of control, right now
Don't give a fuck
All in my zone, in my own world
Chasing things I think I deserve
All the pretty girls have options baby
You're gonna be fine
How to believe to things I can't hold in my hands
Love

I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout all these things we used to do
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you you you
I'm wondering if you think about me too

I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout all these things we used to
