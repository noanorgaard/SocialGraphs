Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you

Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide

Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

Because you're mine, I walk the 
1 ContributorAin’t No Grave (Remix) LyricsJohnny Cash:
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
When I hear the trumpet sound
I'ma rise right out of the ground
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Verse 1:
Rise from the dirt man, rise from hurt
Speak Life over the bones and it'll make a body turn
Crack the urns and watch a dead man come to life, heard what I said
Been through the dirt and grime now you're a witness to the walkin' dead
Anxiety couldn't kill me suicide was laid to the land
Depression had me in the ground with a shovel in its hand
I had arrows in the back from the ones who were above me
And I've had knives in my chest from the ones who said they loved me
Like Lazarus, I rose so brother I can testify
He rose me from the dead and did it right in front of their eyes
They thought wouldn't see til the day my spirit's captured
But the author of life chose to add a chapter
You might also likeThe tombstones will crumble 'cuz the voice of God rumbles
And the corpses of chosen they will rise from the rubble
So I got tales from the crypt and believe they're full of hope
You said you don't believe in zombies but the dead woke
Hook: Johnny Cash & (Sharon Irving)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(Ain't no grave)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(Hold my body down)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(When I hear that trumpet sound)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(I'm gonna rise right out of the ground)
Verse 2:
With this new life given I'll make sure the work's divine
As long as my heart is beating, I'll never give a flat line
So my family in the faith, watch your words, be wise
'Cuz the bride of Christ is looking like the Bride of Frankenstein
Body parts are everywhere sown poorly with the gospel
Infested with pestilence and the structure is awful
'Cuz when the church is full of people but the message is worthless
Your little Sunday mass is really a funeral service
The people die from the lack of knowledge says the scripture
When you only see in black and white you'll never see the picture
The very word of God was created to uplift
But how many abused it to send millions to the pit
Don't let fake a servant dig your tomb with their tongue
Stomp the head of the serpent turn your head towards the Son
We lost too many people to those who claimed to be saved
So to the servants of falsehood, I declare there ain't no grave
Hook: Johnny Cash & (Sharon Irving)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(Ain't no grave)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(Hold my body down)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(When I hear that trumpet sound)
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
(I'm gonna rise right out of the ground)
Verse 3:
Now it's time to speak life to the people who will listen
Put my money where my mouth is that's why Cash is in the rhythm
Adonai can save from the darkest nights of the soul
'Cuz in this game of life you have to give Master control
There ain't no addiction that I know you cannot conquer
Alcohol, drugs, porn I know my God is stronger
Restoring the families the enemy tried breaking
You can lift your head child because of grace amazing
And there ain't no sickness my Father cannot cure
From mental depression to Cancer, I'm sure
I'm a witness to his power so I could never deny it
It only takes a leap of faith and I dare you to try
Put your faith in Messiah who walked through the fire and paid the cost
The man who took on the devil and danced with death, never lost
So place your trust in the Son and cling on to his name
Ain't no grave held the Savior and for you, it's the same
Hook: Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body 

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

I would keep myself
I would find a

And Blues Brothers:
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies"
