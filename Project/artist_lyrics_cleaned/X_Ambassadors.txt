And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together
And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together

Play dead
Roll over
Stinking like sex in a range rover
Bail out
Baby you asked for it
Pray that someone in the car got the cash for it
Love songs
Are drug songs
We can get together if you understand me
Blink twice
Baby think twice

Grown man
Tipping over
Stinking like a badge and a filled quota
Hard time
Break you out again
Break you out
Break you out again
Break you out
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm

It’s cops to dodge in the city of God
To reach the goals of these soccer stars
There’s records to break, medals to take
Flags to wave, the city is ours
There’s ceilings to climb, the road winds
Only lights is those from a Bimmer
It’s nice to pray in front of Christ the Redeemer
If your guy is bigger than my guy up there
My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?
It’s foretold by Calogero, most Bronx tales don’t end well
Especially when your own country treats you like an infidel
There's eyes that needs enswell
Don’t box me into the corner, I
Float like a butterfly, sting like Muhammad A
On training day I go too hard, ask Antoine Fuqua
I am Godzilla of these favelas, new God flow

I lost my mind, in the city of lights (yeah)
In the backstreets buildings and the neon lights (yeah)
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain (yeah)
It's the same to me, just a different name
