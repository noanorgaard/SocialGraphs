A dirty no-good, down to the bone
Your worst nightmare, can't take me home

So I've got some mischief in my blood
Can you blame me? I never got no love

They think I'm callous, a low-life hood
I feel so useless, misunderstood

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core
You might also like
Call me a schemer, call me a freak
How can you say that? I'm just unique

What, me? A traitor? Ain't got your back?
Are we not friends? What's up with that?

So I'm a misfit, so I'm a flirt
I broke your heart, I made you hurt?

The past is past, forgive, forget
The truth is, you ain't seen nothing yet

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the
