Girl, I, must (Warn you)
I sense something strange in my mind, yeah, yo
Situation is (Serious)
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
It's oh so (Beautiful)
Relationships, they seem from the start, yeah, mhm
It's all so (Deadly)
When love is not together from the heart, mhm, check it out

It's drivin' me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move, you're dead)
You might also like
That girl is (Poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (Poison)

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I step to meet a fly girl, you know?
'Cause in some (Portions)
You'll think she's the best thing in the world
She's so (Fly)
She'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware, she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' "demon," ooh
Poison, deadly, movin' in slow
Lookin' for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin' paid, laid, so better lay low
Schemin' on house, money and the whole show
The low pro ho, she'll be cut like an afro
See what you're sayin', huh
She's a winner to you, but I know she's a loser
(How do you know?), me and the crew used to do her
Poison
Poison
Poison
Poison
Poison

I was at the park, shake, breakin', and takin 'em all
And that night, I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open, still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be with a high-power chest
Michael Bivins here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell Biv DeVoe (Hahaha)
Now you know
Yo, Slick, blow

It's drivin' me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it out of my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move, you're dead)
That girl is (Poison)
(Poison, poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile
(Poison)
(Poison, poison)
She's dangerous
(Poison) Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Poison)

Yo, fellas, that was another dope one
You know what I'm sayin', Mike?
Yeah, B.B.D. in full effect
Yo, what's up to Ralph T and Johnny G
And I can't forget about my boy B. Brown
And the whole NE crew


Tears I see drop from your eyes
Tell me why you cry
Guilt I feel when you look at me
Did I let you down?

Girl, you see that I, I apologize
Tell me what to do to get through to you
Girl, it's not the same, I know I was to blame
Just tell me, when will I see you smile again?

Tell me, when will I see you smile again?
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Oh)
And I know you're fed up, sugar (Ooh, hey, hey)
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (Oh, ooh, oh, oh)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar (Ah)

Promises I know I made many times before
And I broke each one of them
But I had to learn over and over again
Don't hurt the one you love

Girl, you see that I, I apologize
Tell me what to do to get through to you
Girl, it's not the same, I know I was to blame
Just tell me, when will I see you smile again?

Tell me, when will I see you smile again?
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Oh)
And I know you're fed up, sugar (Oh, hey, hey)
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (I wonder if you can tell me, tell me)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar

Look, baby, listen
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
You see, I just can't understand
Why I keep making the same damn mistake over and over again
But there's one question that remains in the back of my mind, love
And that is when will I see you smile again?
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (Maybe we can talk it over)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Maybe we can work it out)
And I know you're fed up, sugar
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (Is there something I can say?)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby
And I know you're fed up, sugar (Is there something I can do? Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (Oh, ooh)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Girl)
And I know you're fed up, sugar (Yeah)
Tell me, when will I see you smile again? (Ooh)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Oh, hey, hey)
And I know
