All you want, all you need
I could be your anything
Tell me, girl, what you need
Honest eyes, no disguise
You know where I'll be tonight
Tell me, girl, what you need

Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do, all I want is you

Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya, darling
Ooh, how I want ya
Ooh, how I need ya- (Dance floor!)

What's the play in this game?
Tell me if you feel the same
Do you care either way?
You can't fight what feels right
I can see it in your eyes
Say what you want to say

Cause I'll be waiting for you
Trying just to get through
Tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
And I've been up the whole night
Trying to get my head right
No matter what I do, all I want is you
