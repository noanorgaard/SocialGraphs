I see you standing in the driveway
Looking hotter than a California summer
My lips were drier than the drought that day
You lay one on me you lay one on me anyways

I see us passed out at your pool
I know we got shit to do but that ain't no new news
So take me back now take me back now
Take me back now take me back now

Everything's different now but change is all good
I haven't seen you in a minute and that's on me
But know when they say your name, they can watch me, watch them watch me dissolve

Skip town along with the sunset
My pretty baby and my golden afternoon
My window's always rolled down
Take me back now take me back now. (x5)
