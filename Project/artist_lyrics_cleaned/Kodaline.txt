The sun will stop shining soon, and you'll be dark in my life
Yeah, you'll be gone, it's as simple as a change of heart
But I'm not gonna think about the future

A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind, I don't really mind at all

Step into the night, love, it grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking about was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?

Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Mmh, just as simple as a change of heart

I remember it now, it takes me back
To when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it
And I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But It's not that easy

But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes
When it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people
Who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick
But they leave you far too soon
Naïve, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
I do believe it

High hopes

But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
