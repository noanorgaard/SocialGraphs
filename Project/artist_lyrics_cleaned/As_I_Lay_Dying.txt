When did the road that I'm on
Become my only home?
When did this become
The one place I truly know? (I truly know)

A journey making us like weeds
Where the wind steals our splendor
But spreads it to the distant fields
Despite our fragile imperfections
Yet shaking walls and wearing wheels
Can never capture my heart the way you do

You bring me through the darkness of myself
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

From the outside, I've deceived the world
With false bravery
Yet you have taught me so much more
Much more than I can ever teach
And someday, you might need
Someone to lean on

I can only hope that I'll have gained the courage

At times, I'm carried on the shoulders of a child
I find power in your firm fallibility
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail
And I'm better able to live because you're alive
I could not imagine a world without you
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die
Suffering
Persistence

Sincere
I sought your truth and divine purpose
Through myths of revelation
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box
Supported only so long
As my mind was the enemy
I could not in conscience hold on

As we face distress
We must not lose heart
Stand fast and press on
Triumph awaits

Whispering silence
The subtle contradiction
Compromise creeps in
Forgetting who I once was
Slowly changing
Who I once was (Who I once was)

Each moment seemed so small
When looked at by itself
But it adds up
And it has torn me down
All lines are gone

Some say to release it, forget about your past
Instead we count the cost, it's part of us
That doesn't mean that we cannot move on
It's just a memory of what we once were

No matter what it is we've faced
It's now part of us (Part of us)
We can overcome

Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger
When properly put behind us? (Put behind us)
And in the same way that everything good in life
Can be taken away, so can all this pain

With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything
With no lungs to breathe
I had almost lost everything

How can I be expected to readily be content
With a view of life that has rejected
The basis of what has helped me to survive?
(What has helped me to survive?)
And replaced them with precepts
Rather than instruction
Full rule is an illusion (Illusion)
All I can do is contain selfishness
And unveil what little power we may have

A foreigner, no place to go
Holding on, making the most
Of what little time I have

All the wasted words I said
In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret

I will not leave wishing
I had done things differently

The moments I treasure are seldom
The ones that I planned for
And if I knew where pain hid
I might still let it go
So, when the audience has
Run toward the latest drift
It will be my time to face
The life that I have set

Peace and pain
Seems more like a blur
But I know with certainty
I can't leave wishing

In all the cities that I left
The last act of our precious play
Must not close with regret, regret

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me
Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me

I've labeled enemies who do not hate me
And then claimed friends who could care less
All an unnecessary struggle
So now I know what it means to repent
Changing everything

Before I tear, tear out my eyes
I'll just admit they're part of me

I'll just admit they're part of me
They're part of me

But what wisdom is there within us
To live based on the feeling of our hearts?
How many times has instinct let us down?
Never to be thought through, never to be questioned!
Say what you really mean
When your ambition calls you, calls you!
For what use is there, is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
"Truth" that sounds right to our ears

We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us?
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?

The truth of my heart
Is like a repressed tale
A censored and silenced story

Repression or restraint
It is a delicate balance
Between bleeding out
What will make me drown
And closing in
What I cannot afford to spill

Either way, I must cauterize
Cauterize the open wound

Fighting so hard to be heard
Yet having nothing to say
You talk about changing masses
But forget those close to you

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

You can justify almost anything
If you are willing to be loud enough
But once you've spent everything
To change the world around you
Even if your voice is taken away
Such actions will still inspire
