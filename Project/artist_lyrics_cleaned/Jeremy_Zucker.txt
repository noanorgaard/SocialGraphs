You should get to know me
Same old dude you could treat me like your homie
Call if you're sad or holler if you're lonely
With those eyes alone baby you could be my only
Let's take a chance just call when you come through
Easily I'd be the man you could run to
Sleep with an eye open right by my side and
You'll see I ain't got much to hide

I took a picture with you tonight
You look like somebody out of a fashion magazine
I know you think that I'm not polite
You should get to know me
Swear I'm not as bad as I seem
Ohh, ohh, oh I'm not as bad as I seem
Ohh, ohh, oh I'm not as bad as I seem

I'm not some alpha male that you see
On movies and TV, no that's just not me
Look at me closer, you judge from afar
Bang on my body see I do no harm
I'm not some 80's jerk on the screen
Varsity jacket who hangs with the team
Thought we left high school, no cliques anymore
Act like a lady, leave tricks at the door, at the door

How do you know, where I'm going
You show me where I won't fall
Do you know where I'm going
You show me where I won't fall


No matter what you say
Or how you talk about it
I'm not playing games, no, oh
This bed won't feel the same, yeah
Without your sound
I lose a crown

But I will hold you still
If these four walls crumble from the thrill
(Thrill, thrill, thrill, thrill)
Be there by my side
Even if the sun falls from the sky
(Sky, sky, sky, sky)
Just breathe, baby (baby, baby)
Breathe, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Breathe, ooh
Breathe, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Breathe, oh
Breathe, yeah (yeah)
Breathe, ooh (oh)
Breathe, yeah (yeah)

I could let you go
And you talk about me with your friends
And forget all the things you feel, girl
'Cause I would probably do the same

Hold me me back from someone special
Take my heart and make it less, oh
Let me go just when I need you
I won't let you down
Oh, never let you 

Where did you go?
Where did you come from?
I should've known
I could've run from
But when I move
It just brings me back to you

I get this feeling when you hold me close
I know it's burning but I won't let go
They told me I couldn't go higher
I'm flying with my wings on fire
I get this feeling when you hold me close
I know it's burning but I won't let go

I'm easily the worst on my own
The distance never makes you seem farther, you know?
