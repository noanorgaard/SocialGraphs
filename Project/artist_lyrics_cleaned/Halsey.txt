Didn't know where I was running to

I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price

I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude

Both got way better things to do

I think there's a flaw in my code

Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers 'cause you'll never take the blame like me?
