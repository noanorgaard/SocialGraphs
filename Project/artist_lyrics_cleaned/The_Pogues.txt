They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome, you were pretty, queen of New York City
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night
You might also like
The boys of the NYPD choir were singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day

You're a bum, you're a punk, you're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot, you cheap, lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse, I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir, still singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out for Christmas Day

"I could have been someone", well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me when I first found you
I kept them with me, babe, I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone, I've built my dreams around you

The boys of the NYPD choir, still singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out for Christmas Day
