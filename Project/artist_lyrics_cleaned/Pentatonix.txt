There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories of
Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing
When love ones are near

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride (Come on lets go)
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Come on, it's lovely weather

She broke your throne and she cut your hair

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

The fireplace is burning bright, shining all on me
I see the presents underneath the good old Christmas tree
And I wait all night 'til Santa comes to wake me from my dreams
Oh, why? Cause that's Christmas to me

While mom and daddy share a kiss under the mistletoe
And we'll cherish all these simple things wherever we may be
Oh, why? Cause that's Christmas to me

I've got this Christmas song in my heart (Song in my heart)

As I fall asleep to lullabies, the morning's coming soon
