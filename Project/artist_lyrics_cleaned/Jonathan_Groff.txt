Oh, thanks, buddy

But people smell better than reindeers
Sven, don't you think I'm right?
That's once again true
For all except you
You got me, let's call it a night
Good night

Don't let the frostbite biteYou might also 

Da-da-da-dat-da, dat-da-da-da-da-ya-da
Da-da-dat-dat-da-ya-da
Da-da-da-dat-da, dat-da-da-da-da-ya-da
