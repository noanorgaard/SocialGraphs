With each birth, every tear, we have hope, we have hope
Speck of gold in your heart
Everyone, everyone
Speck of gold in your heart
Every sun, everyone
Speck of gold
Cold, cold ways, I won't
Hold you heart to this light
One and all, one and all
Speck of gold
Speck of gold, that we just unfolded
Love your heart, love your heart
Speck of gold, everyone hold our sun
Wanna live

My brother told me, "Go easy on those guys" (Guys)
They gon' have it harder when they see the kiddo rise (See the kiddo rise)
Beatrix, I'm gaugin' out their eyes (Eyes)
Every time these verses are reprised (Yeah)
Kill 'em with success and they'll never have a clue to how they died (Died, died)
Think about it
You ain't really mad at me, you bitches mad at yourself
That shit is bad for your health
But fuck it (Fuck it, go and drag 'em to Hell)
You a selfish motherfucker, only pass to yourself (Only pass to yourself)
Maybe I should tone it down a little, ask for some help (I should ask for some help)
But there's two types of people in this world (Yeah)
Those who gotta ask (Ask), and those who make it happen themself
And I refuse to be a bitch like you, I'm not a bit like you
I've been stabbed in the back so many times that it slip right through

Yeah, my famiglia real G's so you never hear 'em
'Cause they be low as fuck, try me, come and test your luck
I be tryna chill, but the problems always level up
Feel like Meadow's dad, ventin' to a memo pad
When it ends, does it really all cut to black?
'Cause if it does, I hope the afterlife will cut us slack (Slack)
I've been to Hell and back (Back)
Already walkin' dead (Dead)
Feel like a motherfuckin' zombie

So much pussy I'm denyin' bitches
They get with us, then they lie with us
Big stone, wide eyes, see my diamonds glisten
Hustle harder than Tracy Morgan in the '90s, nigga
Gutter grimy like a '90s nigga
Doggystyle, the right position
Kiss the girls, make 'em cry
Tellin' more lies than a politician
Got the gas with me in the Trump Towers
Burn the shit down if the nigga win it
Only sold my soul 'cause I tried to flip it, huh
The pussy mine, use my tongue to write initial, huh
I take your flow, diss you with it, I ain't fuckin' with it
Say, "Mister, mister, please give me some of that, I need a fixin'"
We get high as fuck, then we fight and fuck
It's like guns and roses with the twisted sister
Eyes dilated 'cause this 'cid is vicious
Got a queen kissin' on my sex pistol
I'm in the Gucci Snoopy, fully lucid, death grippin'
Drunk drivin', swervin' left with it
Feel like the only rapper who can match his magic madness is probably Mathers
Bipolar disorder, man, I might be manic
I battle myself for practice, survival tactics, I adapted
I asked God to show my way, but map, He never handed
Satan's guestlist
Fuckin' Rihanna in Bahamas, top of my checklist
Turquoise settin', blood diamonds, die for my necklace
Only-child syndrome, selfish
Trapped in my mind, doin' a sentence
Shit, somebody help him (Help him, please, help him, help him)
Shit, somebody help him (Help him, 
1 ContributorMidnight LyricsLord God Almighty let me tell the news
My head got wet in midnight dew
Great God I been down on my bended knees
Talking to a man from galilee
Michael spoke and he sound so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God Almighty let me tell you what He said
Go tell that lonesome liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Tell the gamblin', ramblin' backslider
Tell them God Almighty gonna cut 'em down
You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children (?), for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down
You might throw your rock, hide your head
Work in the dark with your fellow men
Sure as God made you rich and poor
You're gonna reap just what you sow
You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children (?), for a long time

Some people go to church just to sit in the fire
Trying to make a date with a neighbor's wife
Brother let me tell you just as sure as you're born
