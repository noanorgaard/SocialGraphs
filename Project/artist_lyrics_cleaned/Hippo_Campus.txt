Violet, trying to start your riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Violet, you and your fucked up riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know

Then you'll come to me
With a bitter wind, in agony
Clean the reds, you'll see
The sky is lost in the company
Of those American eyes
See good on earth and truth in lies

Oh, 

You cry out, Eliza
You scream and you moan
You're sick of this joyride
You want to find home
Adulthood has found you scared and alone
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk

Art school girl with ignorant bliss
Peace, weed, cocaine
And mushrooms
And shit
Will bring peace on earth, someday you'll see it
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk

That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes
It's so satisfying

You put your records on
Exclusively the old Pavement ones
A 90's soul with Doc Martens on
A step, a step away from crying
Degenerate, counter-culture, crying socialist
Hip-to-lazed crazed abstractionists
We're weird, but Lord knows we're trying

That's the way it goes

It's so satisfying
Yeah, that's the way it goes

One step away from crying

She felled the streets 'til she heard the screams
She could drive, she could drive it
That was where she'd buy her time, yeah
Her friends were crazed in the solemn rains
She could try, she could try it
I met her once, she was tight, she was tight
She was tight, she was tight, she was tight as hell

"I'll be fine on my own," she said
"I don't need you inside my head"
She'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own
"I'll be fine on my own," she said
All my love's wrapped in shades of red
She'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own

Growing pains, splaying rain on the high sea
Scale a tree, snap a branch so you can't leave
On the ground, lost and found, understand me
Putting words in my mouth, tryna get free
Solid punch, kind of eyes, make 'em wobbly
Gothic vine, growing fire in the lobby
Lighten up, buttercup, get a hobby
Yeah, swing, sucker, swing, finish sobbing

She'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own
She'll be fine on her own

I'll be fine, I'm alright, it's my body
Gonna stick to my guns like you taught me
Holy hell, I can tell that you hate me
Dying moon, keep me up, keep me waiting
I'll be fine, I'm alright, it’s my body
Gonna stick to my guns like you taught me
