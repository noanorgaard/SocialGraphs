When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright

All of our time spent
In flashes of light

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(Alright)

Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

Ain't nothing but a mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
