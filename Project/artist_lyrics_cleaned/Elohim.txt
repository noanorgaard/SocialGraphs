Cracking your code, nothing was just
You were a stranger
Shifting the mode, breaking the mold
Where did the rain go?

Kiss me with your eyes open
So you can see me when I'm melting
Kiss me with your eyes open
They dilate when you hold me close
Kiss me with your eyes open

Kiss me with your eyes open
Keep 'em open, keep 'em open
Keep 'em open, keep 'em open
You might also like
Sometimes, I trip and think about the past
I end up falling down a dirty path

But you bring me back, put me on track
I’m being crazy
You took me in, brought me to life
Now I’m in paradise
We should stay like this forever
How could anything be better?

Kiss me with your eyes open
So you can see me when I'm melting
Kiss me with your eyes open
They dilate when you hold me close
Kiss me with your eyes open

Kiss me with your eyes open
Keep 'em open, keep 'em open
Keep 'em open, keep 'em open
Kiss me with your eyes open
We should stay like this forever
Kiss me with your eyes open
We should stay like this
