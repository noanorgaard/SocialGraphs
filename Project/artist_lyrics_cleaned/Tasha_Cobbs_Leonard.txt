So I'm gonna put a praise on it
You got it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Where are the radical praisers at?
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
'Cause a miracle just dropped in my house
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Praisers, one more time, you all say
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
We might as well go to church
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Dancing like that I'm gonna join ya
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
One more time
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody clap your hands
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Break it down for me, break it down for me
If you feel good, somebody scream
So a lotta times in church
We clap our hands to transition a moment
But the clapping of the hands is actually a praise called "The Takrah Praise"
And it's the clapping of the hands
And what it says is: Every time I clap my hands
Everything that's been declared over me prophetically, when I put my hands together
I'm saying: And it is so
So we prophesy to our health
We prophesy to our finances
We prophesy to our relationships
We prophesy to our education
And we speak wholeness over our lives
If you believe that God is doing a miracle in your life tonight
I need you to put your hands together
Somebody clap it up: one, two, three
Clap, clap, clap, clap

Hey, I feel real good in the room
Somebody clap between ourselves
Clap, clap, clap
One more time, leap for joy
We got one more time
I need everybody in this room
To get your feet off the floor and leap
Leap, leap, leap
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Clap, clap, clap
Last time
I'm gonna put a
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody shout "

There's an army rising up

Now right here in this moment
I need you to begin to speak to that thing
Come on call it by its name
We come against the spirit of homosexuality
We come against the spirit of rejection and depression
Somebody release it into the atmosphere
That we declare that the chains be broken
Let the chains be broken
The power of life and death
Lies in your tongue
Somebody raise up your voice
(speaking in tongue)
And you declare that the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken
(speaking in tongue)
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling


I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
