I know that I can be mistaken
But you know we all make mistakes
I know you're running out of patience
And I'm running out of things to say

I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
And if you still don't hate me
I'mma let you break me
I'm just as fragile as you

Listen boy, I know I messed up
When I shattered something good
Said some things that I regret now
Left these feels, misunderstood
You might also like
I know that I can be mistaken
But you know we all make mistakes
I know you're running out of patience
And I'm running out of things to say

I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
And if you still don't hate me
I'mma let you break me
I'm just as fragile as you

I know you're running out of patience
And I'm running out of things to say
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
And if you still don't hate me
I'm gonna let you break me
I'm just as fragile as you

I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just as fragile as you-oh-oh-oh-oh
And if you still don't hate me
I'mma let you break me
I'm just as fragile as you
I'm just as fragile as you
I'm just as fragile as you
I'm just as fragile as you
And if you still don't hate me
I'mmma let you break me
I'm just as fragile as
