So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely?
Oh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
It's just like you to come and go
And know me, no, you don't even know me
You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye
A girl like you is just irresistible

Well it's a big, big city and the lights are all out
But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
And I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces and my head's a mess
And it's four in the morning and I'm walking along
Beside the ghost of every drinker here who's ever done wrong
And it's you, woo-hoo, that's got me going crazy for the things you do

So if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me
But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
And only, a girl like you could be lonely
And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
A boy like me is just irresistible

Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that
She said, "You know me well"
I seen you and little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel, oh yeah
Someone said you was asking after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said, "Tell me your name, is it sweet?"
She said, "My boy, it's Dagger", oh yeah
(Woo!)

I was good, she was hot, stealin' everything she got
I was bold, she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear; thank you, dear, bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

She said, "You got me wrong"
I would've sold them to you if I could've
Just to have kept the last of my clothes on, oh yeah
Call me up, take me down with you when you go
I could be your regular belle
And I shall dance for little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel, oh yeah

Chelsea, Chelsea, I believe
That when you're dancing slowly, sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger and another for the one you believe
