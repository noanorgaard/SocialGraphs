You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case
It's like a moon beam brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing "oooh, la la la ,oooh, la la la"
You make me sing "oooh, la la la, oooh, la la la"
You make me sing

And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing "oooh, la la la ,oooh, la la la"
You make me sing "oooh, la la la, oooh, la la la"
You make me sing

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?

Bright, so bright

He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going
