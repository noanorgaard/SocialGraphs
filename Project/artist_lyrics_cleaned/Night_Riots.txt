Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears
I know

Stand in the doorway act like we're okay
Why can't this feel the same?
Hands down, control, darling is this what we both want?
It don't feel right

Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears
I know

I want you, I want you only
For your highs, for your lows
I want you and I, I want you only
All your highs, all your lows
I want you (you, you), when you're lonely
All your highs, all your lows
You might also like
Take me back to your love
I never say it loud enough for you
Take me back to your tears
Before you calmed your fears
I know

I never say it loud enough
Before you calmed your fears
I
