Livin’ for that summer sun out here in the heat
Give me something gold, give me that old time beat

She was golden like the sun, not orange like a tan
That was faked from a bottle, topless model in the sand
From the poster on the wall, bikini centerfold; Her hands
Seem to cover up the areas that often make a man
A little crazy, it's hazy, I think her name is Daisy
Me and G and Ian B. thought she was classy like Mercedes
It’s hotter than in Hades outside, I’m feeling lazy
But as the single one it’s almost implied, I shout “Hey ladies!”
Like its back in ’89 and I’m in Paul’s Boutique
We spin The Beasties, Tribe and Dre, that shit is on repeat
We spark a fire on the beach and start strummin’ the guit
While Terry drops a funky beat, we’ll make your summer complete

Livin’ for that summer sun out here in the heat
Give me something gold, give me that old time beat

Give me the sun and a song to write and I’ma live a longer life
A diamond shines brightest when you hold it in the light
On Some days I wish that I could steal the sun rays
I love a sun kissed misses and summer time kisses
On with the business, reach the sand, feeling right
Joint in my left hand, drink in my right
It's all for love though, loving those who down with the same vibe
So aim high, don't matter age, skill or frame size
We're all on the same ride, didn't notice where we're going
So when the sun shines I try to focus on the moment
Hope that it stays forever now that I've seen it come
Cause that's where I belong in the sweet summer sun

Livin’ for that summer sun out here in the heat
Give me something gold, give me that old time beat

Just like them old times
Ganja high, Tequila wit dat salty lime
Girls ‘pon the dance floor, short skirts, hands in sky
The reggae band gonna hit the stage, your distress gonna disengage
Street Pharm ripping up the stage, gonna need more lemon pledge
There's something about those sunny hours that
I don't know, just makes ya wanna kiss some
Bodies be steaming hot like edamame
Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah, the party's moving back stage
Naughty, you ain't gotta go home
So don't go, I threw away the keys to your car
You ain't gotta go home
So just listen to the beer bottle slide on guitar

Livin’ for that summer sun out here in the heat
Give me something gold, give me that old time
