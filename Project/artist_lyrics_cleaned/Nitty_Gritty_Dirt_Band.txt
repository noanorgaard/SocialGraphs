Ooh, you've seen it all before
And heard the same lines
But if you're willing just to take a chance
It could be alright (So fine)
We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight

So don't you try to change the subject
Or try to put yourself above it
A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you, that's true

A little sleep is all we're losing
It's up to us to do the choosing

Across the field where the crick turns back
By the old stone road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby get ready
Ooh, ooh

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
Feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
The days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer

Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night

Voila! An American dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign
