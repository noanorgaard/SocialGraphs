It’s still dark outside

I know. I just need to write something down

Why do you write like you’re running out of time?

Shhh

Come back to bed. That would be enough

I’ll be back before you know I’m gone

Come back to sleep

Well, I’m going back to sleep

Hey. Best of wives and best of 

Helpless
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em

I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzlin' the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "boom"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

Grab my sister and whisper, "Yo, this one's mine"
Ooh
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinkin', "What's she gonna do?" (Ooh)
She grabs you by the arm, I'm thinkin', "I'm through" (Ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm

Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
Yeah, I'm helpless
I know
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

I'm so into you
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I am so into you
I'm helpless
I know I'm
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Where are you taking me?

I'm about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you
Schuyler?

My sister

Thank you for all your service

If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I'll leave you to it

One week later

I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share 'em
Ha!
Two weeks later in the livin' room stressin'
My father's stone-faced while you're askin' for his blessin'
I'm dyin' inside as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
'Cause there's nothin' that your mind can't do

Ooh
My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinkin', "We're through" (Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says, "Be true" (Ooh)
And you turn back to me, smilin', and I'm

Helpless
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless (Helpless)
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em (Hoo)
Helpless
That boy is mine, that boy is mine
Look into your eyes and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless
Helpless
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
Yeah
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so—

Helpless (I do, I do, I do, I do)
Eliza
Helpless (I do, I do, I do, I do)
I've never felt so— (Hey)
Helpless (Yeah, yeah)
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm down for the count, I'm—
Yo, my life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it
Helpless
I look into your eyes and the sky's the limit, I'm—
Helpless
Helpless
Down for the count and I'm

Drownin' in 'em

In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man



How long have you known?

A month or so

Eliza, you should have told me

I wrote to the General a month ago

No

I begged him to send you home

You should've told me
You might also like
I'm not sorry

I knew you'd fight until the war was won
The war's not done
But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

I relish being your wife
Look around, look around
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind
Look out world, that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough
We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be 

One two three four five six seven eight nine!
My dearest, Angelica
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day"
I trust you'll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

Take a break

I am on my way

There's a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate

Alexander—

Okay, okay—
Your son is nine years old today
And he has something that he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away—
Daddy, daddy, look—
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can't write mine
What!
I practice French
And play piano with my mother (Uh-huh!)
I have a sister
But I want a little brother (Okay!)
My daddy's trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq! (Bravo!)

Take a break
Hey, our kid is pretty great

Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

Eliza, I've got so much on my plate

We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know…

I know

In a nearby park

I'd love to go

You and I can go when the night gets dark…

I will try to get away

My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop 'til you agree
Your fav'rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days
It says:

"My dearest Angelica"

With a comma after "dearest." You've written

"My dearest, Angelica."

Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer
At my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your fam'ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy
I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait

You won't be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica's arriving today!
Angelica!

Eliza!

The Schuyler sisters!

Alexander

Hi

It's good to see your face

Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway

…you're not joining us? Wait

I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate

Alexander, I came all this way

She came all this way—

All this way—

Take a break

You know I have to get my plan through Congress

Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

I lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress
We can all go stay with our father

There's a lake I know
I know I'll miss your face—
In a nearby park
Screw your courage to the sticking place—
You and I can go
Eliza's right—
Take a break and get away— (Take a break)
Run away with us for the summer—
Let's go upstate (Let's go upstate)
Where we can stay
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time—
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now— (You will make your mark)
Close your eyes and dream—
We can go—
When the night gets dark (When the night gets dark)
Take a break (Take a break)

I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop until I get this plan through
