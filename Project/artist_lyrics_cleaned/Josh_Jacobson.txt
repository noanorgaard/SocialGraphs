1 ContributorNot Alone Lyrics
Don't you know the prettiest things rise up from sunsets?
All my favorite stories happened right here on this pavement, pavement
Got cuts around and through my bones
You never answer your phone anymore
Got no one to talk to
Where the fuck did my best friend go, go, go, go

Don't stop, listen to the beat
Come and drink another one down with me

I'm not alone, oh-oh-oh-oho
I'm not alone, oh-oh-oh-oho
Hey you should know
I'm not alone, you should know, oh-oh-oh-oho
I'm not alone

I'm living with hope and fear
And broken hearts
And sit out until you wash apart
But they never sit down, let it happen
And we never changed, but
You might also like
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Hey you should know
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

You burned through my chest
When you turned off the music
You burned through my chest
When you turned off my music
Don't you know the best stories go quiet
While we're dancing in the sunrise
All of my favorite kiss stolen
And the corners who still hasn't opened
Saw your bottom over in the breeze
Coming on I know it, hit me like a forest
In the heat, oh-oh-oh

Don't stop, listen to the beat
Come and drink another one down with me
I'm not alone, oh-oh-oh-oho
I'm not alone, oh-oh-oh-oho
Hey you should know
I'm not alone, you should know, oh-oh-oh-oho
I'm not alone

Living with–I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm living with
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I'm living with hope and fear
And broken hearts
And sit out till you wash apart
But they never said how bad it hurt
And they never came
