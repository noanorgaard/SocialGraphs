Well, easy easy
There's no need to take that tone
Well easy
I'm on the telephone
Man just leave us alone

Ow no I should've kept my receipt
Cause the sandwich I bought
Yeah it's been off for a week
And 'low Tesco's stealing my money
When positivity seems hard to reach
I keep my head down and my mouth shut
Cause if you’re going through hell
You just keep going

I’ll scan a different coast
Where my blame can lay and roast
In the heat of my own treason
Just as another pavement toasts
I remain aware of those
When consumed to paths of reason
Now do you stew your lovers croak to the glue of your own throat?
When the scenery starts peeling
And the scenery starts peeling
This is the final line I wrote
And applying the final coat
That would bring down the ceiling

This is the final line I wrote

Well easy now, easy now
Maybe I was found
Just bathed in doubtYou might also 

Well, if only
I had a heart to rip into
Because you owe me
A breakdown that would not include
Not to stay around
And see this night through
Girl, don't stay around
And bathe with me in blue
Just one of those things
Just one of those things
Just wanna let you know
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say

We all find a day
To slip away
You pour your heart, your aching soul
Where I stay bold
Look for the times you took to hold
My naked soul
Deep sea diver
Born skiver
Two month fiver
I’ve hurt everyone but you
I see things simple
But it only rekindles
These dark shades of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue
It’s the darkest shade of blue

I guess it’s my turn to burn through
The rest of these funny days
I stress when my turn to
Earn you a better life runs astray
I can’t say what’s right
But understand the pain that enslaves
It hasn’t hit me as easily
As some might say
It hasn’t hit me in the same way
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much else to say
It hasn’t hit me but I still feel the pain
It hasn’t hit me
There was not much more to say

And the soul chokes
To cause the tide
To enforce divide
This whole ocean has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion to con the mind

See here I trace my steps
To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush
This slowly seeping straight through the crust
Now let these stains of gunk slip down
To where my head once sunk and drowned
Just await for a while to see
My body has merged to the deep cruel sea

But my soul floats
Adrift thoughtless minds, distorted lines
The soul is broken down, borderlines
To cause the tide, to enforce divide
This whole ocean has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion and con the mind

So scorn divine and mourn the pride
The cold has spoken and drawn the 

See, the cement has never meant so much
My hot head cools to the stone cold touch
I look to settle my seed with the dust
Brain, leave me be, can't you see that these eyes are 

Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl, I've got no chance and nothing to say
Girl, but stay here for a little while

Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last, baby blue

Bobbing on the problem
On the problem, on the throbbing
She was falling, I was bawling
My heart was stopping, she was throbbing, 

Well I don't wanna be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna fuck things over 'cos that's a start
Well if I can't have her then no one can

Oh, but baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue, and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same

But I'm not gonna crack like you cracked

You got no legs to get you near my height
So don't try and get near my hide
Don't try and get out the way yeah
I see what you gotta say
I hear your lizard state
If that's okay and if that's not okay
Say girl now what's okay

Well I don't want to be trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna make it clear and girl I'll tear you apart
From the inside to the out

But baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want of you
It's just not fair
Baby blue and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same
But girl what was I supposed to do?
Yeah I was so hung up on loving you
And girl believe me this is something new
‘Cause all I will do
Is girl whatever I have to do
They all knifed me in the back and girl I can’t believe
It’s slipping away like 

Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away

And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well, I had no chance to get away
I can't escape my own escape
Even more when it's sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh, but girl, just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well, take my crown again

So much has lost it now

Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

Now watch me burn alive as your thoughts deprive
All I know that’s inside
See I was torn by a skunks hand
And now they watch me crawl
See I was born by a young man
And now I’ve lost it all
