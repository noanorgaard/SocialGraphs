Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness?
Every girl, every man (hoo-hoo, hoo-ooo)
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't wanna rock DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop DJ
'Cause you're keeping me up all night

Singing in the classes, music for your masses
Give no head no backstage passes
Have a proper giggle I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mic, I rock the mic (Right)
You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl but your best friend can
It's time to move your body

Pimping ain't easy, most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimping ain't easy
But if you're selling it (selling it, selling it)
It's alright
