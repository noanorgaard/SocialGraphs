Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops
The old men will always think they know it all
Young girls will dream about the boys of fall

I've read a lot of books
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's going, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of Cinnamon Bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

When I passed out from too much Cruzan and Diet
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites
I swear got them all sitting right there
In that old blue chair

There's a blue rocking chair
Sitting in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled 

Where no one's around
But the silence and the sound
Of "Three Little Birds" for company
I got a sip of something strong
A secondhand "Old Man and the Sea"
Out here with me
Me and Marley

God knows I love my life and I thank Him every night
But sometimes I feel the knife of responsibility
And the struggle and the strife, what's wrong and what's right
Has got me searching for the light and my place of peace

And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

And a man learning to move on

Driving my first love out to the levee

Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along

And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore

Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, "That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"

He said, "Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, "I'm a Grandpa"
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He said, "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, "I'm sorry," say, "So am I"
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels

Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

24 hour television
Gets so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians
Talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothin' left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it

I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more

She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me

We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night

She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weenie ride before I take her home

I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well, I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well, my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say, "What the hell?"
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

It's like Friday night working on a three day weekend
There's something in a jar just made for sipping
It's feeling like a feel good time-bomb ticking
Standing round waiting on beer can chicken
It's the little things that make life worth living

That old jam box playing in the background takes me somewhere
Back to some old late night country highway radio
I've got all my friends hanging out, sitting right here with me

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers, heart breakers, already getting loud

Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Fall in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the redneck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama

There's hot time, low tide, years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign that says "live your life" just for inspiration

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
As she brought them to their feet

She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place

And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small-time town was hers

She says, "If you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight"

Somewhere with you, laughing loud on a carnival ride
Yeah, driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said, "Pick me up at three a.m."
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up that ex to rescue me
Climb in their bed when I'd much rather sleep

Somewhere with you, like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

Ah, if you ever decide to leave

In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
