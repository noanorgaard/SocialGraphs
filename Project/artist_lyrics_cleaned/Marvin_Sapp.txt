I started singing, I started clapping
I started dancing, people were laughing
They knew my problems, they knew my pain
But I knew God would take them away
I have my share of ups and downs
Times when there was no one around
God came and spoke these words to me
Praise will confuse the enemy
(repeat 2x)

I started singing
I started clapping
I started dancing
People were laughing
They knew my problems
They knew my pain
But I knew God would take them away

That’s why I praise him with a dance
He’s given me a second chance
Come on lets praise him in advance
That’s why I praise him with a song
When things are right and when they’re wrong
He’s given me a second chance
Come on lets praise Him in advance
Praise Him
Praise Him
Praise Him
Praise Him
Praise Him
Praise Him
Praise Him in
