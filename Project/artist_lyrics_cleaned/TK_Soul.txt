Dear Daddy
I just wanted to let you know I miss you
Every time I watch wrestling I think of you
Do you watch wrestling?
Ma & Pa bought it for me
Why don't you ever call me?
You love me right? Write me back!
Mom doesn't know I stole a stamp to send you that
I can't wait to see you again
Hope you're having fun
I'm proud to be your son
How's your life anything new?
Remember we would play 2000 on my Nintendo when it was new
I get my pencil from school draw a stencil of ME & You & Mom
In a perfect world we would live together
But why did me and mommy move away? I don't get the point
She said because all you cared about was the next joint
I didn't know what she meant by that
She said you beat her when she was six months pregnant then more often after that
Maybe you were just wrestling. It looked real though
It was unsettling to me
I tried to join in the fun but you pushed me off repetitively
And you looked really mad as you walked off violently
I apologize so much Dad
Why did you break stuff and run out so mad?
Is it my fault?
I'm sorry
A billion times over
I'm sorry x3

You've been gone for so long
It's time to let go
You disappeared in the shadows
Just trying to save your soul
You left me all alone
And now you're too far gone
So Gone

I've seen my Dad's ex-girlfriends sex toy laying on the counter top
Seen the faggots weed jacket in his wallet is a picture of me when I was nine
Don't know why you still have it
Cause you ain't done shit for me since I was five
I wish I could go back to 1999 and punch him in his fucking face for disowning mine
Loud ass-kicking the neighbors are gonna be begging us for quiet time
It's two hours after midnight
Imma tell the cunt to shush like a Roy Coleman wind-chime
Break his legs and every limb
I didn't do it for my Mom
I did it for me
Leave that scene looking grim
Hotwire his brand new mustang and spraypaint his truck
The image will say "Fuck You Daddy"
I don't give a fuck
I'm gonna get outta dodge in Bluefield
Smash both of his fucking windsheilds
Walk down the highway
Headphones in through Bakersfield
Then i'mma hit the turnpike looking like Maliki pwning on his own cornfield
Swear I will
Hope you get that miner's license and huffle smoke from the local landfill
Trapped under the ground
I won't even think to frown
I don't care about opinions anymore
Call me an underground clown
Or call me a secluded little prick
You've been gone for so long
It's time to let go
You disappeared in the shadows
Just trying to save your soul
You left me all alone
And now you're too far gone
So Gone

My father left me bad genetics
Like a hairy asscrack and a two inch dick
I feel so sick!
Why? Because I'm raping this instrumental that I stole from a pre-teen on a YouTube playlist flick
I copy Atmosphere's shtick
I'm not original but I'll pass
I failed arithmetic but I don't need much math
Only the kind that is mental
It's simple
I hate the man named Ronald
You're not getting a happy meal you're getting the Donald
Minus the onald
So You're getting D
You're getting Dick
If you're not dead I hope you get locked up and your left felt up by a man named Terry
I was set-up for failure I was named after Matthew fucking Perry
90210 was a show about teens
But that dude was in his mid thirties
Back to the topic
You are not worthy
If you are homeless looking for food Sorry you're getting scurvy
Thanks for the excess hair, Shit is furry
If you are listening to this
I mant everything I said. You heard me?
Remember who your son was
Ronald Dylan Justice
He's dead
I'm the new one
That's why I changed my last name to Ecitsuj ya see
The J is silent
I'm tryna forget U.S.T
This rant on you is overdue
You on a street? I'll drive avenue
You're the president? I'll throw a shoe
You like red? Well, I like Blue
If I get someone pregnant, You won't know who
I'm Hitler and you're just a jew
You cheap motel I'm ocean view
You Powhatan I am Sioux
You like Moose I like Caribou
Looking for a nail
I'll give screws to you
You get Iron Sheik opinion boo
That's two words
FACK
