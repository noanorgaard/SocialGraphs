I told you, I told you not to worry... baby
I told you, I told you I'd be alright
I told, I told you it was a lie
Yeah when you break down brother, I come and pick you up
It's just a matter of time, it's just a labor of love
I want to, (I want to) I want to be there
I want to, (I want to) I want to be someone ya can count on
I tried to, (I tried to) I tried to be a friend
I hope you, (I hope you)I hope you come around... in the end
And when you feel like you can't go out ...I come and give you a shove
It's just a matter of time, it's just a labor of love
We all need someone sometimes... to pull us out whеn we're stuck
It's just a matter of timе, it's just a labor of love
And when you break down brother, I come and pick you up
It's just a matter of time, it's just a labor of love
Just 'cause your back on your feet
Again... don't mean they won't pull the rug
It's just a matter of time, it's just a labor of love
It's just a matter of time, it's just a labor of loveYou might also
