Yeah, you give me reason
To hold my breath, hold my head, make a mess
Thinking 'bout what we got in store
No, no, heey, could be fun

Clear mirror lights but you cross
Passing by and I'm gone, gone
FADED

Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Champagne be pouring plink, plink
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Ha, I'll have it

Clear mirror lights but you cross
Passing by and I'm gone, gone
FADED

Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Champagne be pouring plink, plink
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Ha, I'll have it

Clear mirror lights but you cross
Passing by and I'm gone, gone
FADED
Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Champagne be pouring plink, plink
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Put it on my tab, I'll have it
Don't wanna think, think
All I do is clink, clink
Ha, I'll have it

Ha, I'll have it
Ha, I'll have
