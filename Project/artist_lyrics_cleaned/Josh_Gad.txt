Nope!
But sometimes, I like to close my eyes
And imagine what it'd be like when summer does come, ah

Bees'll buzz
Kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer
A drink in my hand
My snow up against the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer
I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm
And I can't wait to see
What my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer
Bad-dah, da-doo, uh-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-boo
The hot and the cold are both so intense
Put 'em together, it just makes sense
Rrrat, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doo

But put me in summer and I'll be a
Happy snowman
When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam
Oh, the sky would be blue
And you guys will be there too
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer

I'm gonna tell him

Don't you dare!

In 

Pbbbt, sure, yeah, that'd be great. 

Okay, let's do it. 

Heh, what you mean...now?

Why not?

Well, to be honest, I, I've never done it before. 
That's okay, neither have I. 

Hahaha, yes, that's true. 

Do you know...how to baptize someone into the church?

Sure, that's something that we study over and over again at Mission Control Center. 

Then please, Elder Cunningham, I want to be baptized. I swear to dedicate my life to the church. 

Huh, okay, I just need a second to get ready. 

Okay, I will get ready, too. 

I'm about to do it for the first time
And I'm gonna do it with a girl!
A special girl
Who makes my heart kind of flutter
Makes my eyes kind of blur
I can't believe I'm about to baptize her

He will baptize me
He will hold me in his arms
And he will baptize me
Right in front of everyone
And it will set me free
When he looks into my eyes
And he sees just how much
I love being baptized
I'm gonna baptize her

Baptize me!

Bathe her in God's glory!
And I will baptize her

I'm ready

With everything I got
And I'll make her beg for more

Ooh

As I wash her free of sin
And it'll be so good
She'll want me to

Baptize her again (Baptize me again)
Excuse me, I'm gonna need another minute!

Never known a boy so gentle
One like him is hard to find
A special kind
Who makes my heart kind of flutter
Like a moth in a cocoon
I hope he gets to baptizing me soon!

I'm gonna baptize you
I'm through with all my stalling

You're gonna baptize me
I'm ready to let you do it

And it will set us free
It's time to be immersed
And I'm so happy you're
About to be my first

Okay, you ready?

I am ready. So how do we do it?

Well, I hold you like this. 

Yeah?

And I lower you down. 

Yeah?

And then I...
I just baptized her!
She got doused by Heavenly Father!
I just baptized her good!

You baptized me!

I performed like a champ!

I'm wet with salvation!

We just went all the way!
Praise be to God
I'll never forget this day

I baptized you!

You baptized me!

I gotcha good!

Baptize me!

You want it more, baby?

Baptize me!
(spoken)
I'll text you later. 

My best friend

And set the world's people free
And we can do it together
You and me
But mostly me!
You and me, but mostly me
Are gonna change the world forever
'Cause I can do most anything

And I can stand next to you and watch!

Every hero needs a sidekick
Every captain needs a mate

Aye-aye!

Every dinner needs a side dish

On a slightly smaller plate!

And now we're seeing eye to eye
It's so great we can agree
That Heavenly Father has chosen
You and me

Just mostly me!
Something incredible
I'll do something incredible!
I want to be the Mormon
Who changed all of mankind

My best friend
It's something I've foreseen
Now that I'm nineteen
I'll do something incredible
That blows God's freaking mind!

And as long as we stick together

And I stay out of your way

Out of my way!

We can change the world

Forever

And make tomorrow a latter day!

Mostly me!
So quit singing about it

And do it
How ready and psyched are we?
Life is about to change for you
And life is about to change for me
And life is about to change for you and me

But me, mostly!
And there's no limit to
What we can do
Me and you
But mostly


Well, alright then. Let's get some sleep, huh?

Yeah...
So tired...
(sung)
Sleep now, little buddy
Put your cares away
Nappy with a happy face
Tomorrow's a latter day

What are you doing?

I'm just trying to make you feel better!

I feel fine, but this is what I'm talking about, Elder. Our focus needs to be on our work. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be? The missionaries here have yet to bring a single person to the church!

Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here then it wouldn't be so incredible when you did it, now would it?
You might also like
I guess, I guess that's kind of true...

Don't forget what you told me! You are awesome! Together, we're gonna bring lots of Africans to the church! And then, my dad will finally feel proud of me, instead of just feeling "stuck" with me. 

You know what, Elder? I think your dad's got plenty to be proud of right now. 

Really?

Yeah!

Evening star shines brightly
God makes life anew
Tomorrow is a latter day
And I am here for you

I am here for you, too

We are here for us
Goodnight, best friend!

Goodnight, pal. Embed
