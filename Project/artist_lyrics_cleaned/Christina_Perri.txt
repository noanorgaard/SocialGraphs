Love like this may come once, baby, it's fate
Like a soulmate, he's your penguin
Baby, it's fate, baby, it's fate, not luck

Can you find the time to let your lover hold you?
He needs somebody to hold too
His love is strong and so true, his arrow is aiming for you
And he's the one that you were born to love

Love like this may come once, baby, it's fate
Like a soulmate, he's your penguin
Baby, it's fate, baby, it's fate, not luck

(Ooh, ooh)
Let go, let go of time for you and I
Let go, let go of time for you and I
Let go, let go of time for you and I

You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

You put your arms around me and I'm home

How many times will you let me change my mind and turn around?
I can't decide if I'll let you save my life, or if I'll drown

I hope that you see right through my walls
I hope that you catch me, 'cause I'm already fallin'
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home

The world is comin' down on me and I can't find a reason to be loved
I never wanna leave you, but I can't make you bleed if I'm alone

You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me

I'll love you for a thousand more

I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

Too afraid to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night
But the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me 'til I fall asleep

Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me
And the lonely

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
And let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart 

And I will make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" when you're not listening
And how long can we keep this up, up, up?

Please don't stand so close to me, I'm having trouble breathing
I'm afraid of what you'll see, right now
I'll give you everything I am
All my broken heartbeats until I know you'll understand

And I will make sure to keep my distance
Say "I love you" when you're not listening
And how long can we keep this up, up, up?

And I keep waiting
For you to take me
You keep waiting
To save what we have

Looking through the window to a world of dreams
I can see my future slip away
Honey, you won't get there if you don't believe
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough, I'm standing up
I need, I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

I'm setting fire to the life that I know (Know)
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go (Go)
We're starting fires, we're starting fires
'Til our lives are burning gold
'Til our lives are burning gold

Looking for my ticket to a higher place
I can see my chance begin to fade
One step forward and two back again
I wish the wind would carry a change

I can do it

But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
'Cause I'm only human

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
