Back in the game like it's Twista my nigga
Right on the spot like it's twister my nigga, get it
I been under pressure lately
A bit too much to make a diamond, if it's estimated
A bit too much to weigh the music and the school shit
And it's all because I try to balance both, like I have to make it
I need a lot of head for the stress, I'm giving out a lot of babies everyday
She blowing up my phone with the texts, like she think she got a baby on the way
I tried to tell her to get rid of it, but all she do is call me ignorant
We always fighting over some little shit
I'm cold-hearted, I'm evil, I'm inconsiderate, and I'll be god damned
I can't worry 'bout pampers
The weight on my shoulders, there's just enough damage
I dropped a hell of a tape, took a break, now I'm working on something to match it
Me that rude boy named Major is major, that happens when talent is natural
I got my juice and it's time I say something to these rappers
Something to these rappers

Man, man, man, you should hate yourself
Look into a mirror, nigga rate yourself
Look at the shit that we doing, motivate yourself
Brace yourself

I done got my motherfucking juice back (yeah)
I done got my motherfucking juice back (I got my juice)
I done got my juice back
I done got my motherfucking juice back
Motherfucking juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice
Okay juice

I drop that Price City mixtape, and then a nigga went silent
I did way too many niggas a solid
When bae told me she feeling nauseous, I prayed to God and he responded
I been feeling way, way, way, way up
Getting cake, but I only let 'em see the cookie jar
Working in private I never bothered nobody but
I still wish a nigga would up on a shooting star
Nigga, you drop one song that they don't fuck with and they gone hate you
Them niggas ain't fam to me
If that blood ain't thicker than yellow pages
Fuck it I'll bleed out an ocean
My niggas humble until you provoke em'
My little niggas stronger man, this is what I told them
The grass is only greener when you smoke it, nigga
So I be where the garden at
Had you check my pockets and they feeling like a parliament Pardon that
But when you buzzing look at how they try to call you back And the real ones that with you won't run
Whoever is there now, should have been there from one
Some will ride with you, and some will ride on you
What goes around comes back around like a blunt, nigga
Man, man, man, you should hate yourself
Look into a mirror, nigga rate yourself
Look at the shit that we doing, motivate yourself
Brace yourself

I done got my motherfucking juice back (yeah)
I done got my motherfucking juice back (I got my juice)
I done got my juice back
I done got my motherfucking juice back
Motherfucking juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice
Okay
