Believe me
You've never met a motherfucker like me
Bet you've never seen the things that I've seen
Bottled up inside
This time I'm taking back my life
I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes

This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
You might also like
I'll break you a hundred different ways
And I'll make you remember my face
Thought that I would let you leave
It's hard to stop what you can't see
I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes

This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible
I will waste you
And you can't escape it now
When I will break you down

I'm feeling invincible tonight
Take your time
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I'ma take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
Invincible
Invincible
