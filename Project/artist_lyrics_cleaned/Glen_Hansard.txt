And you have broken me
All the way now
You'll be the last, you'll see

And some fight you gave
When I pushed you away from me

And in the morning
When you're turning
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me
All the way down
You'll be the last, you'll see (Oh, no)
(Da dum da, da da)

And what chance had we got
When you missed every shot for me

And in the morning
When you're turning
I'll be out of reach
And in the darkness
When you find this
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me
All the way down
You'll be the last, you'll see

Oh da
Da da da
Da da dum da, 

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You'll make it now

Falling slowly
Eyes that know me
And I can't go back
And moods that take me
And erase me
And I'm painted black

Well, you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat
And point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You have a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly
Sing your melody
I'll sing along

Take it all
I played the cards too late
Now you're 

I'm gonna see you there, there
Where we can be natural, there
Cause I've been livin' in the half life
Not sure which way to turn
Why must a man lose everything
To find out what he wants
I'm gonna wait until it feels right
And when that time has come
Wild horses won't keep me back
From where you have gone

Maybe when our hearts have had some time
I'm gonna see you there

After all we've seen
We can do anything, there
Where your heart is strong
Where we can go on and on, there
Where your good times gone
Where we are forever young, there
Where your heart is strong
Where we can go on and on, there, there!
I wanna see you
