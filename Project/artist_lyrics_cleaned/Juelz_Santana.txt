The champ is back
Yup
This is my anthem track
Yup
This wasn't made for to dance or for your hands to clap
This that
Gutter, gutter motherfucker AY
This that
Get your knife, time to gut a motherfucker AY
They hand you the snub
Dismantle your mug
A headshot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs
The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (AY)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (AY)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (AY)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (AY)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (AY)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (AY)
Grip to it, kick to it

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your Glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack
Come see me, little nigga, I'll give you a gat like
Here, here's a hammer nigga
Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga
Here, go murk a nigga
Grip to it, kick to it
Fuck that, spit to it
Sorry people, party people
This ain't kids' music
Nope
This is violence (violence, violence)
