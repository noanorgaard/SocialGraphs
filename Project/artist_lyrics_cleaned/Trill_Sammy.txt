K-K-Kick a hoe out like Martin
I'mma put on for my city like Harden
Y'all gon make me get the gas in Jamaica
I smoke this shit like Bob Marley
And I kick it wit some white boys
That turnt the fuck up and they callin me Gnarly
And should put it in my face man I swear
I'mma eat it just like I was starvin
Pull up in foreigns but trap out impalas
I'm use to juggin for dollars
I can see it in my future like future
I might just fuck up some commas
Her ass look like Nicki
Her face a Rihanna but she white just like Madonna
Double chill a they was two bitches
Got her off the lot but the roof missin skrrt
All this damn money what to do with it goddamn
All this damn money what to do with it
Bitches got a condo got a pool wit it
Anyway damn he a fool wit it
Had to get a bro a stack

Serving out a shack
Got a mansion as a trap
Member I was broke I ain't going back damn
