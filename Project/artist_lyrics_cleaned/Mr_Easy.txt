Oh Yeah
What a bagaration
Low it
Mek me hold a meditation

The strangest thing just happened to me
Babylon locked me up with just one ounce of collie
I'm a musician that's just to hold my meddie
Bredrens and bredrens tell me would you all agree

Tell the Babylon dem to let me out and open the door
I've never been in this position before
Fly the gate and free up Jah Cure
Tell the yute come sing to the poor
Bust the chain and free up the lock
Nah ride in Babylon truck back
Officer what kind of chump charge that?
Beg you sweep it under the mat

Babylon locked me up with just one ounce of collie

Popped off them big guns like them think me woulda scream

Big up all the farmer man way out there in the west
Just want to sow the seed and reep the good cess
Babylon a fight it, just another test
A we run the world so we must a haffi progress
Doctors and lawyers they use it too
Police and soldiers you know that's true
No bother with the road block and the curfew
Just smoke the herb and let them go threw
The strangest thing just happened to me
Babylon locked me up with just one ounce of collie
I'm a musician that's just to hold my meddie
Bredrens and bredrens tell me would you all agree

Just tell the babylon them to let me out and open the door
I've never been in this position before
Fly the gate and free up Jah Cure
Time for the yute come sing to the poor
Bust the chain and free up the lock
Nah ride in Babylon truck back
