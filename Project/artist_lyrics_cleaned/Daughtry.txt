I’m sinking inside
And the masts and lines are broken down tonight
I swallow my pride
But we’re drowning in the ocean and it’s tearing my heart open, baby

We’re high then we’re low, first it’s yes then it’s no
And we’re changing like the tides
Yeah, but I want you, I need you, and I guarantee you, we’ll make it out alive

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
You might also like
Bombs fly through the air
And I know that we’re both playing not so fair
Ohh, show me, show me you care
Got my white flag up and it’s waving
'Cause you know this love’s worth savin', baby

We’re high then we’re low, first it’s yes then it’s no
And we’re changing like the tides
Yeah, but I want you, I need you, and I guarantee you, we’ll make it out alive

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
And we love, yeah, we love
And we love, yeah, we love
I’m sinking inside
Can we finally put our weapons down tonight?

'Cause I don’t wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don’t wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don’t wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
And the cannon goes
(And we love, yeah, we love)
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, boom
Boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom
(And we love, yeah, we love)
(And we love, yeah, we love like 

Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you

You took a hammer to these walls
Dragged the memories down the hall
Packed your bags and walked away
There was nothing I could say
And when you slammed the front door shut
A lot of others opened up
So did my eyes so I could see
That you never were the best for me

Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally gettin' better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
And spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
I got over you
Well, I never saw it coming
I shoulda started running
A long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you

(Woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah)
Well, I'm putting my heart back together
(Woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I got over you
