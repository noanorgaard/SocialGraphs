Say you're upset, but you ain't meant to be, no
The way we beat gon' make the remedy
And you singin' in my ear while I'm givin' you this melody
We can go slow or fast if you want
Forget them other guys that be on you
I might be one of them guys that be on you
Would you tell me what you wanna do?

'Cause baby girl, it's quarter past three, so what's it gon' be?
I seen you at the party and you're lookin' naughty
Yeah, you say you're really on me
Well, tell me what you wanna do
We can takе it slow or fast if you want
Forget your ex though, I've gonе and made some dumb moves
In the bedroom, it can be a whole mood if you tell me what you wanna do

Ooh, ooh, tell me
You don't know if you can get if you don't tell me what you want

Tell me-ee (Ooh, yeah, ooh), tell me what you want
I'll be all alone if that's what you need
