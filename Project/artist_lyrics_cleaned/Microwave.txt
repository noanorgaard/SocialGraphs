I spent all my money so I've been sleeping in your car
And I hate your car, but I'll sleep there anyways
Quik Mart raised the prices on
All my favorite vices
And my van broke down 
Now I got nowhere to stay

You tell me if I really loved you then I would buy you a ring
But all I've got are some black gel bracelets my goth friends gave me
I wove 'em in a 69 so at least you'd know
I'm clever and sexual
I guess love makes us do funny things
And I think you like that secretly
You might also like
I spent all my money so I've been sleeping on your floor
I hate your floor, but I'll sleep there anyways
Quik Mart raised the prices on
All my favorite vices
And my van broke down
Now I've got nowhere to stay

I know I said I'd never stop believing in myself
But honestly I've said a lot of shit 
So while my soul is slowly running out of forgiveness
I'll find a way to hide or just forget

I spent all my money so I've been sleeping on your couch
And I hate your couch, but I'll sleep there anyways
Quik Mart raised the prices on
All my favorite vices
And my van broke down
Now I've got nowhere to stay

I spent all my money so I've been sleeping in your bed
I hate your bed, but I love sleeping next to you
Quik Mart raised the prices on
All my favorite vices
And my van broke down
Now I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know it's gonna be with you
It's gonna be with you
I know it's gonna be with
