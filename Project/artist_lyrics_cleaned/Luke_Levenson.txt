So many books I can read
They make me feel happy
But I read them in a sad life
Trying to make a new life
I usually spend all my money
That I got from my job
Better off without a job
Need to chance to spend all the dances
All the pretty prancers
That help me write a new song

And it gives me a good chance
To be a woman
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you
And I know what it means
To be covered in good music
That you never hear
But I'm here now
And I breathe loud
Breathe in that smoke while you drive, baby
I breathe in that smoke while you drive

Heard a call in a bathroom stall in Harlem
Words were heard but I was there with my church
We didn't bother
See my mind is small but the world is large,
Oh brother
I pray that you're no Jesus
As long as you and I are cronies, smoke another

Breathe in that smoke while you drive, baby
I breathe in that smoke while you drive

Now that I'm unemployed
Need to find a way to support
All the crazy little hobbies
They use to stop me,
Demons that my love ignores
Like the trouble in music (music)
Music keeps 'em grounded
Second knock comes to the door
I hit the floor
When the bass hits
I pray to the Lord
But I found myself watching the world
In the crazy new optimist way
I'm feeling gorgeous
I'm feeling,
All the dark that I've seen
Never happened to me
And I shout them away

Away, away, away...
I light a cigarette and I
Breathe in that smoke while you drive, baby
I breathe in that smoke while you drive

Heard a call in a bathroom stall in Harlem
Words were heard but I was there with my church
We didn't bother
See my mind is small but the world is large,
Oh brother
I pray that you're no Jesus
As long as you and I are cronies, smoke another

I breathe in that smoke while you drive
I breathe in that smoke while you drive
I breathe in that smoke while you drive
I breathe in that smoke while you
