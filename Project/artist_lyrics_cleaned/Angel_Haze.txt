Money and more money is the only shit I’m after
You can cut the fake shit, I’m not a motherfuckin' actor
I’m on top of my green like a motherfuckin' tractor
You niggas you ‘bout to be bitches, you bitches 'bout to be Casper

I’ll be on that other shit got that from my other bitch
She come from an island or a desert or some tundra shit
I am multi-faceted, bitch I do a ton of shit
Like I’m diarrhea or whatever's sitting under it
I’m nasty, I’m insane, I’m too much, I spit grains
I came from the fuckin’ bottom
I’m top now, I shift lanes
I kick shit, like dope shit
Like no shit, like oh shit
Get in my way I fuck up everything
Like ho shit
See, they said that I wouldn't
I do whatever they said I couldn't
I’m not the one to be fucked with
Or to be tough with
I be on your head like duck, duck, duck bitch
I be in the air like pump-pumped up fists
Nah, I’m like up-chuck like gut fish like hands up my skirt
Like when you gon' let me fuck bitch

Money and more money is the only shit I’m after
You can cut the fake shit
I’m not a motherfuckin' actor
I’m on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor
You niggas you ‘bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper
I’m an undefeated bastard
My tongue is the fucking rapture, bitch
I be at my peak, I am not the one to be mastered
I’m the one to be after, I’m sweeping you while I’m dusting
I just popped up out the blue, I’m spontaneously combusting
Spit a little different, give me just a minute
Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it
We are not the same but they don’t really get it
Tell ‘em do the math, hoe—fraction, division
Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic
Eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning
Cause I ki-ki-ki-kill it ‘til it’s flat dead
And never pass a rock like a motherfucking crackhead

Money and more money is the only shit I’m after
You can cut the fake shit
I’m not a motherfuckin' actor
I’m on top of my green like a motherfucking tractor
You niggas you ‘bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be
