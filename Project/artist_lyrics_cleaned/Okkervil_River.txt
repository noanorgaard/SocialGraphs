"I've got dreams, dreams to remember"
But not even home will be with you forever

It is Christmastime and the plane flies me over white hills
To a town in a dream where the sky, it is frozen and still
And a room that's not mine but it's just like I left it before
With the wax from the candles all dusty and locks on the door
Where I held you so tenderly
And where in summer I opened your letter to me

Now I am standing where we kneeled
And a miracle mile now borders it
But if I turn my face to the field
I don't even notice it for a second

There is a tangle of greenery where winter scenery ends
And I hear that song sometimes, imagine us much more than friends
Like if we stayed in this town, bought the first house that went up on sale
And how each Christmastime would bring in-laws and snow days and holiday mail

Yeah, well
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Oh Sara, come back to New Hampshire, we'll stay there
