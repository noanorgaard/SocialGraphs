Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
Worship Your holy name

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy namе

You're rich in love and You're slow to angеr
Your name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
You might also like
So bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

You know, I'm an Englishman, and by default I have to love Charles Wesley. And you know, one reason I love him is on his deathbed, age 81, and he couldn't stop singing, he couldn't stop writing these  amazing hymns of praise. And he's so weak in that moment, he had to have this written down for him, just one verse line, his last ever hymn. And it said this:
"In age and feebleness extreme
Who shall a helpless worm redeem?
Jesus! My only hope Thou art
Strength of my failing flesh and heart;
O, could I catch one smile from Thee
And drop into eternity!"
Isn't that wonderful? You hear the love of Christ in those lyrics, his desire to know Him and be with Him

Oh Jesus, on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still, my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore
King Jesus!

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name (Forever)
I'll worship Your holy name
God, I'll worship Your holy
