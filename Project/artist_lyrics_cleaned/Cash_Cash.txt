I was all you thought you ever needed
So you said, "How the hell did I let this slip away?"
Have I lost myself?
I was stumbling right on the edge
You pulled me back for one last dance
Yeah, I was lost on the darkest road
I need your light to lead me home

Now I can feel your pulse kickstarting this lifeless soul
Like a lightning bolt to heart
You woke me up, woke me up, yeah
Like a lightning bolt to heart
You woke me up, woke me up, yeah

I swear your friends know when to post your photograph
It doesn’t really hurt, but it always takes me back to 16
In your basement and your parents, my feelings
And I never got over it

How did you break my heart without even trying?
How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me
You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground
You were made of matches, and you burned me down

Everybody says that you're still living your life
One weekend to the next still tryna' get it right
The truth is I worry you never found something to escape who you used to be

I found my own way of coping with your mess
And I found my own reasons why you weren't the best for me
Why couldn't you be the best for me?

But I still stay
'Cause you're the only thing I know
So won't you take, oh
Won't you take me home?
Take me home, home, home
Take me home, home, home
Take me

Take me, take me, take me
Take me home

Round in circles, here we go
With the highest highs and the lowest lows
But no one shakes me like you do
My best mistake was you
And you're my sweet affliction
'Cause you hurt me right, but you do it nice
Round in circles, here we go
Yeah

I pushed and pulled all the ones that tried
Then I watched them fade away
As I look around a vacant room
I see nobody left here to blame
‘Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackled up by all my fears
But I feel you breaking away at the walls
Make them fall make them all disappear
