And sun, sun, sun all down our necks
And there'll sun, sun, sun all over our faces
And sun, sun, sun, so what the heck?

'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes

There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go
There'll be love, love, love
Wherever you go, there'll be
