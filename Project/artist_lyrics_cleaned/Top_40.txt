1 ContributorSinging For England LyricsIt's the time of the year, it's the time of our lives
And the nation is gripped in it's heart and it's mind
To commemorate this there's new songs to be sung
And we'll all sing along at the top of our lungs
Some hazy positivity, some boisterous shouting
A bit of jingoism and a lot of carousing
Always supporting hookline and sinker
Cos nothing says we love you like a top 40 single
Come on! Sing when we're winning
We'll always be singing for England
The passion and pride you feel supporting a team
Is quite tricky to evoke with such a strict rhyming scheme
So match a non-specific lyric urging "go all way"
To some power chords that they can use on Match Of The Day
Appealing to fanatics is a difficult job
It's not thermodynamics but it's hard to pull off
Just keep it panoramic, optimistic, don't bore us
Even the disaffected love a singalong chorus
Or something
We can reach for the top if we just pull it through
And dream to believe that the goal is in you, now you
Realise that's nonsense and you know it's a lie but for
Just a fleeting moment brings the country to life...

We're singing for England
We're singing for England
And any other sports team
Yes, your generic sports team
We're singing for your sports team
Just play the instrumental
And insert the name of your team
We'll inspire the team to victory
With a very simple melody
We will take the team to victory
And the melody will ring ring ring in your ears
It's E For
