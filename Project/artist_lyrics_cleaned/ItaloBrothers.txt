Okay, but so were you

Let's go back, let's go now
Let's go back, let's go now
The summer air, the summer air

Stay the night, maybe two

You grabbed my hand, you took me to paradise
And by no chance if I get this night
Since I'm back home, I feel like paralyzed
Baby it's all wrong, let's make it right

Why don't we just go back, back to where we came from?
The summer air, the summer air

The summer air, the summer air

Let's go back, let's go now
Let's go back, let's go now
