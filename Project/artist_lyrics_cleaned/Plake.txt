Mama said, “Why you gotta waste my time?”
I threw it to the wind, no line
It's something that I need, no crime
The call can't reconnect this time and
The substances we craved subsided
I never want to live half sided, no

Yeah, yeah, but still I persist on
I feel like we're orphaned
My halo got all bent
I hate how I feel and I'm falling
But I say nothing, I say nothing

No, I can't believe you wanted me
I cannot see the lining here
I fall asleep to sounds of dreams of you
You're losing me, losing me, don't lose me
Don't lose grip on me, feelings down on me
Heartbeats down on me, on me, on me

Staring at the screen but I feel no way
Bleeding through to real life, fucking up the wave
I can make you feel, but could never make you stay
What do you want from me?
What do I hope to see?
I haven't been home in weeks

Still, I can feel loved for now
And I can accept the paths I've taken
And if all this dies out I'll be good
Still, I'm down and

Da- dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade
