It's finally summer homie! Put a drink in my hand
To sit back and watch the sunset, feet in the sand
All my friends with me, camp fire on the beach
We got a lil bit booz and lil bit weed
It's all good, right now for me
So lets all dance, were getting down with it
Turn the music up loud, I'm playing the summer jam
And then we all try to sing even if we can't
A couple more drinks down, it's dark, and times passing
It really flys by when you got everybody laughing
A whole lot of fun and the sound of the waves crashing
Wannaa live in the moment, relax!
And lets make it happen
So miss summer baby! Don't you leave me now
I'm getting used warm weather and girls that their wear bikinis out
Live my life at the beach
I sure hope so
Pass me another beer for now, to sip slow
You might also like
I got some drinks
For a sipping all day
Pour it out
Soak it in
Pass the time
It ain't no thing
Baby sip slow
Ain't no staying now baby
Ya
I said sip slow
Keep everybody waiting
Sip slow yeah
Said sip slow yeah
Said sip slow
Just take your time and sip slow

Half past eleven til I'm finally waking up
I'd love a plate of eggs, but I don't feel like gettin' up
Got no responsibility, I'm doing what I wanna
And that's the best part about it, there's no rules for the summer!
There's sunshine, with no signs of rain
Bet it's shitty back home, that's why I live in LA
I'll prolly never see the sunrise, forget it
But I just showed up poolside, rooftop and I'm chilling
With the hot girls
Cold drinks
Im here to have fun
I know this won't last forever, so I'm enjoying it while I'm young Called home to my family, just to tell them that I'm happy with
Being out of college, cause I don't even need that piece of shit paper to prove that's not what I wanna do
I'm making money on own I putting my talents to use
I heard they're calling for an endless summer, I sure hope so
Pass me another beer for now, to sip slow
I got some drinks
For a sipping all day
Pour it out
Soak it in
Pass the time
It ain't no thing
Baby sip slow
Ain't no staying now baby
Ya
I said sip slow
Keep everybody waiting
Sip slow yeah
Said sip slow yeah
Said sip slow
Just take your time and sip
