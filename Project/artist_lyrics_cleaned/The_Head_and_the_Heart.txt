I see a world
A world turning in on itself
Are we just like
Hungry wolves howling in the night?
I don't want no music tonight

Can we go on like it once was?

Every time I hear another story
Oh the poor boy lost his head
Everybody feels a little crazy
But we go on living with it
Yeah, they go on living with it

These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream

I'll tell you one thing
We ain't gonna change much
The sun still rises
Even with the pain
I'll tell you one thing
We ain't gonna change love
The sun still rises
Even through the rain

And there's nothing here
That will not break down
Like you never did

The kids say hello
To us in our separate homes

Darlin' please come home
I've cleaned out the fridge
Wiped the counters off
And put away my clothes

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young, so many years ago

And I think of all this time
That we've wasted with all our fighting
And I cry
Just wanna die with the one I love
Beside me

"Someday," you said
Someday you will miss my head
Lyin' next to yours
In our marriage bed

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young, so many years ago

Oh God, I love my vices
But they've taken me to places
That I never thought I'd go
And I am ready to be home

And I think of every spark
Every whisper in the dark
Now it's time
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Beside me
Honey, come home
My stubborn ways are behind me 

Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh
Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh

Been talkin' 'bout the way things change
And my family lives in a different state
If you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate
So if you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate

Falling from the sky, there are raindrops in my eyes
And my thoughts are diggin' in the backyard
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are
Don't know where they are, don't know where they are

Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me drive you home?

'Cause I've had the rhythm and blues
Since the day you met me
Stepped on my blue suede shoes
Watch Elvis go crazy

Come on, darling, won't you let me
Won't you let me turn you on?

Cause no one likes to be so lonely
No one likes to feel alone
