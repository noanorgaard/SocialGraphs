Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin', stars quit shinin'
Rain was drivin', thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

Rain' was drivin', thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

A category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

It's been a long time since we felt that creek
Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet
Baby, you don't know that this right here
Is the same water my ol' man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say

Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

We'll get you a sip and let the whiskey take control
