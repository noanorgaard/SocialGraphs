I got the aura of Salvatore Luciano
It’s quite a difference in people that you and I know
I been movin since the days of maneuvering through Chicago
The hoodoo I had to do it on you
I truly hate when people try to tell me
I’m fuckin lucky it’s fuckin ugly
The compliment’s really opposite
I don’t let it bug me
I got the ones that I’m rockin wit
We gon stop the muggin
Yeah they popular but they got it tho
They been watchin Bugsy
Posted up while watching gangster flicks
Breakin just to take a piss
Then back to studying what fuckin greatness is
People don’t know what to make of this
I’m the one created this I came up with the vision
Now I paint the pics
Please continue wit ya kingdom jargon
I think I seen my callin
Ain’t no evil genius but the thing’s evolving
I guess that prolly means the dream’s evolving
It ain’t no either or’n we gon keep it goin til the seas are foreign

I got the aura of Lucky but I ain’t lucky
My skin got rougher & coarser they tried to snuff me
The writtens broader and buffer it’s gettin gully
By the way they rub me you’d think they really could out tough me
I roam the streets wit a couple peeps in Meyer and Benny
I inspired many I gotchu my supplier got plenty
If you need a job I can put you on I’m hiring many
I can take it higher I promise
I’m alive in the city
I’m tryna put it together then retire in Naples
Puffin on a stogie I got the bread and wine on the table
I’ll represent the commission for as long as I’m able
And I’m hella bent my decision to arrive as a staple
See this ain’t luck I’m preparing for it like Salvatore
Ain’t rattled boy I can move the cattle I’m at em boy
See thatta boy I got battle tissue from battered glory
They be askin for me this category I’m Salvatore
