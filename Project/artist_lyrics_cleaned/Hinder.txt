I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember (Oh)
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While lookin' through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin' for
If there's one memory I don't wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
(Oh)

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes

The bed I'm layin' is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend
I won't think about you when I'm older
'Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
(End)

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin' to me
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue
