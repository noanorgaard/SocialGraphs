Yo, yo, it's the Unspoken Word, you not heard, get your brains open
Controlled emotions freewill as the same token
Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal
We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two

Word's on the street Dunn Dunn Bobby's going Digital
Hovering the city inside the Wonder Woman's invisible jet
Clouded by the Meth
We move undetected in secret society sects
NARC's radar suspected us to be a cumulus cloud ejecting lightning
Striking like a wild knuckle fight in New Brighton
A million strands of spider webs weaved to make my vest
Chi energy compacted deep within my inner chest
One touch of my eagle claw clutch rips your guts
Brass head kill you fast with the rapid head bust
Ninjas spying, the ammo flying, the steel iron
Blow a nigga neck from his head like dandelions
My team is a magazine of M-16's
But we calmly defeat your army by blowing steam
Noisy as a thousand barkin dogs, rap sweat hogs
Welcome back to the catalogue, hip-hop cyborg
Bobby Digital, keyboard clogged bitch you analog
We blowin smoke creating Scooby Doo fogs
Escape Cell Block H my tape on the rocks
Sean Connery calmly bombing MCs who stuck on my phenomenon

Word up, no hurry up, for the merrier
You worry, Duck, you get touched by the razor cut
You feel the flurry huh, don't worry yo
You get cut by the razor, yo, yo, yo yo

The Wu rag tied around your head like a doorag
Carry large black guns in small school bags
Funeral date will be engraved on the wall in roman numerals
The Looney Tune niggas I be rollin with be screwin' you
Quick to make a nigga shit in his pants with one glance
Laid back like a fat Huffy bike on the kickstands
My Clan'll make the most hardrock chump turn to glass and shatter
Leave no traces of your matter
You kids playin hot feet, wait til you go to sleep I pull your teeth
I'm vegetarian, bitch, I don't need the beef
So how I spell relief?
Ruler Z, Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
B.O.B.B.Y., you don't qualify
You don't have supply, it's a natural high

It's the Unspoken Word, you not heard, get your brains open
Controlled emotions freewill as the same token
Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal
We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two
It's Bobby Digital, word you can't ridicule
We see a snake in the garden, we get rid of you
(Bobby you be on that bullshit) All the time
(With them big words and shit) I free y'all niggas minds
(What the fuck you think you are some king or something?
Motherfucker you ain't shit, high profiling) Yo yo, what?

Enemies of the Killa Bee Clans found their peers
Buried for a thousand years or drowned in tears
My unpredictable lyric script is spine tingling
Like slime from a baby's mouth, bitch niggas you be lingerin'
Bobby bobs panties from bitches with big asses
(Bobby you be bugging) Girl my mind flashes
My seeds be royal, niggas sweat muslim oil
My Earth gave birth to the fertile crescent soil
No time for fragile planet for small wombs
My dick bust a universe, my nuts weigh a moon, stay in tune
Champagne thoughts with Bud Light money, blunts dipped in honey
Digital make the gloomiest day feel sunny
Slang slides slashes for him plan record upon the Lord
Confuse you like a 48 track mixboard
Lyric phaser blast a hole in your back the size of moon craters
These ants get crucified on my Technic crossfader
Fuck the bloodshed, you be leaking your soul
Physical mental emotion we will control
Infinite thoughts I apply to your back like horse branding
Slay a thousand men with a jaw of an assbone, black Samson
It's the Unspoken Word, you not heard, get your brains open
Controlled emotions freewill as the same token
Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal
We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two
It's Bobby Digital, words you can't ridicule
See a snake in the garden, we get rid of you
Slimy savages, against the Digital
Fuck you Analog, the shit is critical
Unspoken Words being heard, get your brains open
Controlled emotions will at the same token
Keep a sword tucked sharp upon your personal
We can bust a shot or we can bust a verse or two
Bobby Digital, words you can't ridicule
See a snake in the garden, we get rid of you
You slimy savages, shit is gettin critical
Fuck you Analog niggas we be Digital
