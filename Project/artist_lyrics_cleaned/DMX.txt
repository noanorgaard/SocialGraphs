East to the West coast, all my bitches

Yo, chickens is good for pluckin', so I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin'
Got 'em trickin' while they suckin', give em dick and they be buggin'
I've done it all, from mackin' two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game, it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight
Over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin' them is the bone
Blowin' up a nigga phone, but ain't nobody home (Damn)
I'm in the zone, tryna do things
Let's turn this into a crew thing, "Wassup girlfriend, you game?"
They'll wonder "Why?", when I leave at night
It's because I thieve at night
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right
I fuck they head up with some slick shit
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit (Woah)
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first date
