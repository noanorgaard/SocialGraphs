Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something

I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to 

Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all of my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly, I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit, I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months, I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though, uh
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a Molotov
This is war, everybody, ain't no reason I'ma call it off

They gotta be demons, I'm blessed every day
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin' it
I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems
And I order more, my wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician (Good, yeah)
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)

Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain, but I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back, it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than an umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me, prolly wanna fight me
But I'll just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?
And keep it real for the people I 

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)

It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die

Paid a price to be me, ain't it nice to be me?
Ain't it nice to be free?

Take 'em back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
