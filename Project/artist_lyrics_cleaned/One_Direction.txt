It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
But they run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'

Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart

Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the whole world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark

But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fightin' in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see

And you've got that one thing

You're not a constant star

And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold

But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

Pay attention, I hope that you listen
