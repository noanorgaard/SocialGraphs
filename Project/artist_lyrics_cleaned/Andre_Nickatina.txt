Choppin' and coppin' the kicks
Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
On Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat and a pack in the sock
Take a couple of toots, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that soft, wonder 'bout that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga powdered out
Could've been a papered-up powerhouse

Like you and I, super high, like Super Fly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin habit, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night

Me and my homies, love the bottle
Like Tyson loves Cus D'amato
So on them days you feelin' real bad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had
Garlic tipped, and they love to hollow
Like Tyson loves Cus D'amato
So before you go to gettin' mad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had

She like the Nikes, I like the 'didas
She like the Reeboks, and I like the Filas
She like the winners, and I like the cheaters
She like the lion, I like the hyenas
Spit some game, then hook up with Shaq
On the PlayStation, I'm known to brag
Hook up with pimps that love the cash
Man you should see how we giggle and laugh
With of hearts of ice, the house is cold
Its like Slick Rick, without the gold
This right here is the life we chose
No excuses just go for gold
There's no producing, this perfect pose
Hit the street in the freshest clothes
Rip the stage, and bless the shows
Spit the flows, and hit the do'

Most of my homies, love the bottle
Like Tyson loves Cus D'amato
So on them days you feelin' real bad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had
Garlic tipped, and they love to hollow
Like Tyson loves Cus D'amato
So before you go to gettin' mad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had
Don't tell me twice, I'm out the door
Talk is not what I came here for
Into the night, like the star by the moon
The engine will rev, and the bass will go boom
Just like the pirate that sailed the seas
Thirteen thieves I do believe
Yes of course they run with me
Flash our rings, or that there freak
Hot to handle, and hard to get
Easy to rip, and hard to fix
So rap your presence, I'll spit the gift
Man you my homie, we'll split the spliff
Ride like a maniac, all in the Cadillac
Tiga, whateva, I'm draped in leather
With angel wings, that rip the wind
And a safety grin of a p-210

'Cause all my homies love the bottle
Like Tyson loves Cus D'amato
So before you go to gettin' mad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had
Guns they lust, and they love to hollow
So before you go to gettin' mad
Think of the best freak that you've ever had
...Like Tyson loves Cus
This life of ours, this is a wonderful life
If you can get through life like this and get away with it, hey that's great
But it's very, unpredictable
There are so many ways you can screw it
