Follow that little red bouncing ball
As it bounced 'round the galaxy came back to us all
The little bit he learned about outer space is
It's gotta destroy before it creates

After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell should be easy
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell would be easier

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
And nobody will love them, nobody will love them

And stuck another needle in the ground

Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
And nobody will love them, nobody will love them

And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean

It can't be easy tryna unwind, sleeping on your daydreams

These days can break, but I'm gonna take the wheel

He stood above the people, all these little people and
Everyone below, they were just little people

You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I got a friend in the devil
But I can't even be your friend, I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

I can get so wound up, but I feel alright
And if I get some rest, yeah, that'd be nice
When I shouldn't do it, I still do it
What you think's got nothing to do with this
Before you were born, I was already sinning
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I get too worked up, well I work it out
And if I get too down, I just shout it out
I may not have it all, but the rest will do
And it's nothing against or to do with you
Before you were born, I was already sinning

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend

All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy, I know what's best for me
I can't help it, it's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (Wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

When I grow up I wanna be
A movie star or on TV
'Cause workin' just don't work for me
But I can't focus, feeling hopeless
So I'll just sit back, try to look mean

It's not greed but necessity

Come on in take a seat next to me
You know we got, we got what you need
We may be liars preaching to choirs
But we can, we can sell you dreams
You don't need sympathy
They got a pill for everything
Just take that dark cloud
Wring it out to wash it down, but

Don't pray for us
We don't need no Modern Jesus to roll with us
The only rule we need is never givin' up
The only faith we have is faith in us

The only faith we have is faith in us

We know that we're helpless, at least we always assumed
But we don't need to prove nothing to you
Let's keep the cool, you don't need to feel blue

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still

Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down

It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?
