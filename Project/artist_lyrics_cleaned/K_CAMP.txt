Creepin' on the low, hope your man don't see
She'll bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, somethin' like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, stop flexin' like you not
Your man tryna patrol that, I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he bustin' at my spot
But I done had enough 'cause you makin' my shit hot
Blowin' up a nigga phone, what I tell your ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold somethin', hold my nuts, can you do that?
Catch me playin' around with that mouth while he hit it from the back
And you can't say nothin' now 'cause we all been through with that, through with that, ayy

You know that ain't a real bag, bitch, that's a knock off
When I get that work I get to juggin' like hot sauce
Outdoor pool, lakefront
Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney
If I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I don't like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy’s
Three cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all 'em nothin'
Yeah, I'm a don, Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius
Watch the Dom spill
Pockets fat as Don Cartagena, nigga, done deal

Baby, I'm ashamed, why you actin' this way?
If she 'bout that action you can bring her this way
Hit her on your mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, andale
Please don't play them games 'cause I know that's what you like
Knock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright

You ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off

Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit is the shit
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade Miss Blue
I don't do too much
Nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on time
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustlel
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Straight up, hah, look
I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump
What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having many girls
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
I've changed, I've changed
If everything around you changed
All I need is change

You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be here
You don't need nobody, you don't need nobody
They don't want to be here, they ain't got to be 

I let you count my money, baby

Aye you 1hunnid, baby?
I'm just tryna figure out just why that nigga hate me
I got money and I throw it with no hesitation
Sneaky bitches, they be schemin' and investigatin'
But I'ma leave 'em waitin', put you in that drop top
Pull up in that mothafucka, make your heart stop
Lame bitches on the side tryna cock block
I pulled off her panties, next it was the crop top
And I will not stop, tell 'em 'bout our situation
It ain't really hard to tell by all the moves I'm makin'
Takin' all these nigga's bitches, you can say I'm Drakein'
I'm that nigga, you that bitch and ain't no damn mistakin'
So tell me why we waitin'

Okay now I'm back again
Rubber bands on rubber bands, you can tell a friend
Slumber party, top floor, bring 'em all in
Missed call, that's your old lady callin'
I think she fallin', she like the way I keep it G
Heard my name around the city, girl you know it's me
You say you bored, let's get some money, no Monopoly
Ain't no flexin' on my pay, I get that broccoli
So ain't no stoppin' me, she like the way that cash feel
Lay it down, I'ma eat it like my last meal
Blew a hundred, still got hundreds in the stash still
She turned nothin' into somethin' and that ass real
Welcome to Cashville
