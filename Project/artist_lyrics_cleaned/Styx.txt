Oh, Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get him dead or alive," now it's for sure he'll see me dead
Dear Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

The wanted man
And I don't wanna go, no, no
Mama, don't let 'em take me!
Hey, hey
No, no, no, I can't 

On board, I'm the captain
So climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow
On every shore
And I'll try, oh, Lord, I'll try
To carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can
To carry on

A gathering of angels
Appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope
And this is what they said

They said, "Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me, babe
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me"



I thought that they were angels
But to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship
We headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with 

You're wondering who I am (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the Modren Man
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control
I need control, we all need control

The problem's plain to see
Too much technology
Machines to save our lives
Machines dehumanize
The time has come at last (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
To throw away this mask (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Now everyone can see (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

I'm Kilroy!
