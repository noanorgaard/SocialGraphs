Somebody with a gassed up truck
Sitting right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody
And you're looking right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody)
I know somebody (I know somebody)

I'm loving the way you act so shy
Like you ain't so sure
Like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends
That you know somebody
That makes you laugh
That can get you home
That might make you fall 'fore the night is gone
So come on, you know
I'm that somebody
Yeah

I love my small-town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road road
Rollin' through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love
Man, I love this life

I love that county-line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sippin' that wine
I still get drunk on her every time

It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and I thanked the Lord for this life of mine
