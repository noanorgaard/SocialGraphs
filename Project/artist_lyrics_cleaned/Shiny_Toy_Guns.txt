We fade away
But now you're living in a dream
I'm torn apart from the one I love
Oh, my baby. Where have you gone?
You know I'm sending angels to watch you sleep
Cuz I'm always on the run
And I don't know what I'd do if I lost you
And what in the world would I do without you?
I try to picture memories we made
On these cold and lonely nights
Sometimes it's hard to see your face
Soon, my baby, when I return
I swear we'll make up every moment to erase the morning sun
And I don't know what I'd do if I lost you
And what in the world would I do without you?
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
And what in the world would I do without you?
And I don't know what I'd do if I lost you
And what in the world would I do without you?
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost you
I wonder what I'd do if I lost youYou might also
