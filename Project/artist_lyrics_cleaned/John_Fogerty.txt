Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield

Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine
Watchin' it from the bench
You know I took some lumps when the Mighty Casey struck out
So say hey, Willie
Tell Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio
Don't say it ain't so
You know the time is now

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield
Yeah, I got it, I got it

Got a beat-up glove, a homemade bat, and brand-new pair of shoes
You know I think it's time to give this game a ride
Just to hit the ball and touch 'em all
A moment in the sun
It's-a gone and you can tell that one goodbye

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, yeah, I can be centerfield
Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, gotta be centerfield
