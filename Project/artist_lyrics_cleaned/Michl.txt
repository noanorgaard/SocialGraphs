And the water's getting deep
Do we swim, or do we sink?
'Cause there's still a long, long way to go

We're in over our heads
We're holding our breath
Will we ever get to the other side
Before there's nothing left?
Yeah, our bodies are weak
We're tired and we're hurtin'
Will we ever get to the other side?
Don't know, but I swear I'll die trying

Can't say yes, can't say no
This thing's out of my control
It's hard to explain it
Heavy hearts weigh us down

And the water's getting deep
Do we swim, or do we sink?
'Cause there's still a long, long way to go

We're in over our heads
We're holding our breath
Will we ever get to the other side

Yeah, our bodies are weak
We're tired and we're hurtin'
Will we ever get to the other side?
Don't know, but I swear I'll die trying

Chain my wrist down to
A sinking ship for you
I'll die trying
Oh, I'll die trying

We're in over our heads
But we're holdin' our breath
Will we ever get to the other side
Before there's nothing left?
Yeah, our bodies are weak
We're tired and we're hurtin'
Will we ever get to the other side?
Don't know
I'll die
