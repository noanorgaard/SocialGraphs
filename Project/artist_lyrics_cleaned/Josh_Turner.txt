She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world

She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love, she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

There's no hurry, don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Let's go over what I had in mind

Baby, lock the door, and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go, I hope you understand
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody the way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how long I've wanted to

Look to the heavens, you can look to the skies
You can find redemption starin' back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burnin' your ticket for that long black train

Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and His Holy name

Time is love, gotta run
Love to hang longer
But I got someone who waits
Waits for me and right now
She's where I need to be
Time is love, gotta run

I only get so many minutes
Don't wanna spend 'em all on the clock
In the time that we spent talking
How many kisses have I lost?

Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Clothes on a clothes line, hanging in the sunshine
A garden growing in the ground
Country music on the radio, talk about a good old sound
People driving pass when I'm cutting grass
Waving at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from, way down South
Way down South

Swimming in the creek with all my friends, way down South
Praying them days would never end, way down South
Give me a worm and a fishing pole, I'll pull a fish on out
Those memories will never get old, way down South

I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while

I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sitting so far back
Out in the country just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are

Cause I'm a backwoods boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a backwoods boy
With no better place to go
Waiting on a deer, wishing on a star
I'll always be true to my heart
Cause I'm a backwoods boy
I'm a backwoods boy

Sitting on the back of Lynches
River with a little campfire
Sleeping on the ground, digging
The sound of a backwoods choir
Talking to the man in the moon
Way up in the sky
He told me to let my worries
Roll on by

Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringin'
Let's go and see who's gettin' baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
'Cause everything is fine

Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feelin' good and everything is fine

Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich, but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mama
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week, we're gonna have a fish fry

He said I'm looking for a man named Jim

Was the souls of the big mans feet

And you better believe

When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a-flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a-poppin'
When we get to kissin', there ain't no stoppin'
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of Black Cats in a red paper wrapper

Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world

Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea

So would you go with me

Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
