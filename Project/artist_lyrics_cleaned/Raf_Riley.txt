Please don't behave now it's the summer
Go be brave, yeah that's my number
And I can feel the shape of your wave when I strum ya
With Etta Bond, yeah that's my mama

What if I told you now or never?
You're too concerned with the weather
I'm tryna hold back
Something's pulling us together

Yo, I get set, then I go
I make friends with my foes
I depend on my don'ts
I assemble my bros
Then break bread with my dough, yeah

I get over my dose

Now go be brave, that's your number
I get set, then I go
I'll tempest when I blow

I'd invest in my don'ts
Then regret what I chose
Boys to men, man I've grown
Ain't no end to my road
Girl, I'd die to live forever

Olly olly olly
How I catch a body, grab her by the body
Give her body, that's another body
That's another body
Wanna hold you down, if you down-down
Unlike the summer, I'm the moon, I'll bring the sun down
If you let me in
I'm knocking, let me in, let me in, let me in

What if I told you now or never?
