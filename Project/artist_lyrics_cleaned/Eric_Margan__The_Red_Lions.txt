And the horses in Vesuvian stables
Or the curves in a long cobblestone road
We are the tales and the fables
Told by Romans at their gathering tables
Or the ghost of a love lost long ago
So bury this city in ashes
We'll speak and breathe with dirt
Our bodies and the air between them
Preserved, dead in earth
We got away with murder
We took our dreams and sealed them with mortar
They're awake in a time that they don't know
They took a day for granted
And now they found a place to be stranded
Just waiting for their mothers
Waiting for a quiet ride home
So bury this city in ashes
We'll speak and breathe with dirt
Our bodies and the air between them
Preserved, dead in earth
