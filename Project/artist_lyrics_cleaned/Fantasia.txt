Listen
Sometimes it takes baby mamas
To show you, you don't need the drama
And once you're high like marijuana
You won't wanna hit no other

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you
So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still (Oh, still)
'Cause without him, how would we know
Our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout all the things you see me through
When I met you
I never knew
'Bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

Listen
Sometimes it takes fireplaces
To show you, you don't need to chase him
And sometimes it takes flowers and good wine
To show you, you don't need the late nights

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you
So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still
'Cause without him, how would we know
That our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things you'd see me through
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

I met me too
When I met you, baby, woah
When I met you
Met me too
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things you'd see me through
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

I met me too when I met you
I-I still remember the day
It was, it was beautiful, yeah
Um, If I hadn't went through the things I'd went before
Then I wouldn't know how special you are
Now, my eyes would still be closed
And, um, now, they're wide open
Because I met 

I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach, there's a pain
See you walk in my direction, I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak, baby
What's happening to me?
In the dark, can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Got me staring out the window
I wish on a star for a sign
With a reason why

You're always on my mind (Oh, yeah)
When you come around, I get shy
Baby, when I see you (See you)
When I see you (Baby, when I, yeah, yeah)
Never know when you might walk by (Walk by)
So I gotta be right on time (Oh, hey, yeah)
When I see you
When I see you (Baby, when I, ooh, yeah)

I scribble X's and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and my nails look
I feel myself in the zone, I get nervous when you call
So, I say I'm not home
I see your face when I hear my favorite song
Should I send an email at home?
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I lay my head on my pillow (Babe)
You got me staring out the window (Ooh, yeah)
I wish on a star for a sign
Huh, what's the reason why? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ey-yeah)

You're always on my mind (You're always, hey)
When you come around, I get shy (Hey, sexy boy)
Baby, when I see you (Uh, you sexy boy)
When I see you (Hey, baby)
Never know when you might walk by (I don't ever know)
So I gotta be right on time (Baby, when I)
When I see you (When I)
When I see you (When I, when I, when I)
Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not gonna run, I'm just gonna stand here and see
Woah, woah, woah, woah-woah-woah, yeah

You're always on my mind (Hey, baby)
When you come around, I get shy (Oh)
Baby, when I see you (When I see you)
When I see you (You're so sexy, boy, you're so sexy, boy)
Never know when you might walk by (I don't ever)
So I gotta be right on time (But I get nervous)
When I see you (Around you)
When I see you (I love it, around you, you, boy)
You're always on my mind (You're always)
When you come around, I get shy (Hey)
Baby, when I see you (You, you, you)
When I see you (I love it, I love it)
Never know when you might walk by (Yes, I love it, baby)
So I gotta be right on time (But I don't know)
