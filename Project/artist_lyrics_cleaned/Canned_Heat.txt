I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time


I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand-new game that I don't wanna play


No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine
