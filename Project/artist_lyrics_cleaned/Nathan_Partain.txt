Yeah

I feel tortured
Like the more pressure is gonna show up because the people left forever
And you know what? I'm tryn— I'm not gonna pretend
Like this the end, like oh, just 'cause I lost a couple friends
Nah, man, I'm still riding up and I'm in safe hands
And I cannot play pretends with the shit that they sayin', uh
Look, I don't want to mince words, alright?
But I'm a fuckin' nerd
But I ain't never been the guy
I ain't never said, alright, talked about my past
But if I did for a second, I reckon I'd tell the truth
Like I do with everything else, yes, it's so big, it hurts, if that helps
Look, but the person that I am is not what they sayin' it is online
And it should be a fuckin' crime
And you know what? It kinda is, my mother, she heard— she started suing
I said, "Mom, what the fuck you doin'?" Hehehehe
I'm like, listen, it's like my life she wants to ruin
Because she's like everybody else, nobody understands in this house
What the Internet, it has done to every woman's son
Oh man, where have I begun?
Discussed this topic, I probably should not have brought it up
Uh, but I've been going through a lot of stuff
And it's been rough, and I've been streaming forever
For a bitch that can't shut the fuck up so I can't trust her
You might also like
Good combo

See, I like the delays 'cause it makes it pay off
When you're a— are doing drugs, you should really stay off it
Bitch, why you acting so soft?
It's like you don't remember what you said in our law
Look, look, I remember too, alright?
We've been through five Decembers too, uh
But you don't understand, huh
My position here as a man
You see, I was providing, I was letting you live inside of a house
I did all this work for, and that was cool
But if I mention it, oh wait, what, I mentioned it
Or I did it for a reason? When you're actin' like I—
Acting like I'm committing treason, ayy, bitch
Yeah, it's Lambo season, oh, speaking of
Yeah, Flex Entertainment, I guess this is an official diss, uh, yeah
It's yo' bitch that I kissed, uh, yeah
Oh, it's your bullet that I missed, uh, yeah
Talkin' to your sister
Talkin' Tina, sendin' you the footage of the screamin'
Yeah, you— you sh-sh-shouldn't have done that
'Cause that is just what I meant
When blackmail is how I spent
My days thinking of, yeah, thinking love is gonna keep this shit together
I should have known better
She was looking for something different, something I can't provide
Something more than just a hole I can be inside
I ain't nothing but, nothing but old mold to her eyes
Like I ain't nothing but cash flow, like a Castro
Look, if I drop it, you know I pick it up
You know I'm sippin' that lean inside of a sippy cup
Hehehehe, yeah
I said, "No, stop, girl, I'm finna nut"
Look
She was into that kinky stuff
Look
I understand she didn't need it rough
But she understands what I give
She'll always need a nu— fuck
Fuck, I ruined the line, but that's okay
'Cause I can say something like "It's a crime to be gay"
Now you forgot what I said, you got out of your head
Okay, goodbye, hey, I ain't even try
I just win, bitch, bitch, I make excuses
Haters mad, man, she is saying I'm abusive
But they looking like Gary Busey
Hey, look, look, look
Look, well, who will win? I guess you'll see
I just be over here, just so I can make it clear
Uh, I'mma snipe 
Yeah
Uh, I'm back again
Listen, I can say it, I have a black friend
Listen, I remember back then, okay?
When she used to scrub my back then, ayy
And now, all she does is yapping, ayy
Talkin' 'bout what she think happened
Well, I could take a dump in it
Everybody you ever hurt in your life is bad
So is me, I'm the new media, hahaha
I'm the picture of the Jew Wikipedia
You don't know what the fuck you got into when you signed me on
When you clicked on this video, when you listened to this song
Was a mistake, I tell you
Shot you in the head like Old Yeller, uh
You're thinkin' I am fortune teller
'Cause I see the future, ayy
Heaven's got none of you fake-ass bitches, lame-ass bitches
Thinkin' that you aren't, we the same-ass bitches, nah
You was on Mars, "I'm gon' stay"-ass bitches
And you thinking that you not, I'm LaFlame, ass bitches, uh
Yeah, look, singing they last wishes
'Cause I'm finally calling them out, ayy, someone's gonna drop, and I ain't—
What can I say, man? I just looked at my bank account
And turns out I got enough to just keep doin' this stuff
So fuck y'all, once again, you are not my friends
Going back to college, this is where my story ends
To a bunch of little bitches, and if I come back
It's gonna keep bein' what I've been doin' up to this track, and
Yeah, bitch, uh
Alright
It's getting good, but we're not done yet, okay?
Ooh
Let's add more drums
More drums is a good idea

I wasn't kidding when I said I've been in the kitchen
They're just wishin' that I just got out, I regret to inform you now
That you is a cash cow, I ain't really bad now
See, I been movin' on, and I been makin' hot songs
Getting bad bitches, sittin' on the throne with me
Oh, man, this shit, it can't be shown on TV
Fuck, this lady showered me in kisses, uh
Yeah, and genie creatin' all they wishes, uh
Sleepin' with the fishes
If you think that you was somehow more efficient
As I'm not fishing for a compliment either
Just feelings, you look like somebody who would be on mean it to— Leave it to Beaver
See, I ain't even remember the name of the show, just 'cause you is a ho
And I already know, uh, that you a mo'fucking joke
Yeah, look, this is just gospel, it's what I spoke
People thinkin' that I got— I went woke?
Well, they might've been right, alright?
But now, all I'm doing is playing Fortnite, uh
Bad bitches with me, uh, all fortnight
They mad, 'cause the reason I'm white
I mean, I'm prolly mad 'cause the reason
All I understand is that I have no reason
To be afraid anymore, of what I say anymore
Because, listen, I don't want to play anymore
Fuck, haters mad, they pray still
But listen, I still don't know what to say still
Look, they gon' say whatever they want about me
But the truth is that I'm ruthless and they ain't— and I ain't going toothless
'Cause you talking How To Train Your Dragon, ayy
Look at my nuts, you already know I'm 'bout to say that they draggin', yeah
Look at my pants, you know that they halfway saggin', ayy
All this money, I keep on bagging, yeah
Bitch, I feel like Bilbo Baggins
'Cause I'm on a journey to defeat evil, yeah
Only difference is I feel like I sound like a conservative
When I say that your evil is not my evil
Ayy, bitch, I do tricks in the air but you don't even care
But she do tricks on there like she's Evil Kenivil, listen
Understand that, when I rap, I don't have a plan
I don't plan what I'm sayin', I just spill 'cause I can
And I do it on cam
So you understand who it is and you understand the biz
Haters mad at me, they just laughin' like some kids
It feels like high school again, bunch of hooligans, uh, yeah
Bad bitches in the pool again, uh, yeah
Man, I gotta get home at ten
You know why? I got some shit I gotta do
Oh, what am I doing, man? It's not up to you
For me to tell you, huh, you a failure, uh
Yeah, my dick, I will impale it
Then I— then make— tell that bitch to go to the tailors
And bring home my suits, and don't come back if she ain't lookin' cute
With my hundred that I gave her to go to salon
The bitch came home with nothin' on
See, there, that's how you know that the game is strong, ayy
Yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm on the fuckin' Olympics
Switchin', ayy, I've just been bitchin', uh
Oh, I'm sorry, I just have too much ambition
That's what I meant to say, yeah, and I've paved the way, uh
For other people to take what I do and make mistakes, man
Look, I'm just saying, you don't have what it takes, man
I'm just saying, man, you just are not a great man
Uh, thinkin' I need a statement, yeah?
Nah, I need a circle replacement
Fuckin' ridiculous, a bunch of clowns
"Oh my God, he did this", a bunch of sounds
I ain't even read what the fuck they said at all
Because, truthfully, I'm too tall, and they not involved
It's that simple, pop haters like a pimple, uh, yeah
Pull up to they residential, yeah
My teeth— yeah, my teeth dentures, yeah
No, this car not a rental, ayy
Who's supplying the lentils?
Bad bitch, but she need some Mentos
Yeah, haha, watchin' "The Sopranos"
Haha, yeah

Alright, let's speed up the beat a lil' bit
Uh
Look

Listen, I ain't playing the same games they are
This ain't Parker Brothers
Bad bitches, they smother like they my mother
That's really disgusting, I'm hoping the people are trusting
That I did not mean it like that, ayy
But it's a fact that the people don't take shit as it is
They don't take the shit as facts, they don't listen to me, what I'm saying
It's not all facts, man, it's not how it seems
But the reality is that I got a different mentality right now
Than the rest of people who are living in the stratosphere
Yeah, that's the Internet for you, if I ain't subtle enough
Yeah, look, now I'm suddenly tough
It's really that simple, man
You go through something like this, the world seems like a simple plan, uh
Listen, I need both, I'm not a simple man
Look, hey, bitch, I am a symbol, man
That's what I'm saying, but they don't see it yet
They just don't understand the reasons yet, ayy
Huh, huh
Told her to get out of my house, don’t understand why she ain’t leavin' yet
Look, I'm just sayin' I need respect
It's really that simple if I just put it like it
Yeah, ayy

Uh, fuck am I even doing?
Look

On every platform, I'm verified
So there ain't shit that I gotta fuckin' clarify, uh
Wow, that was hard, oh my God
Yeah, heh
They ain't seen me like "Where am I?" Ayy
I'm in the buildin', bitch, I'm wearin' a tie, yeah
Ooh
Look
I put the drone on, they don't really understand it yet, huh
But when the song come on, yeah
It's like I'm a musical bandit, yeah
They ain't seen it comin', I just keep on runnin'
I just keep on— yeah, yeah

Alright, time to give myself challenges for this
Okay, let's, um
Okay, that's good
I wanna distort the vocals
But I don't want it to be- oh, this is good
Let's just do double delay, it's gonna be really good
Make it really quiet
Acapella
Adjust, alright
Oh wait, oops
That's good
Where are my drums coming from? "Emotions In Motion"
Uh

When I put up the drums, she comes, yeah
How come? Well, it's simple, man
I make these tracks like I put it on a simple plan
And I ain't talking 'bout the band Simple Plan, yes, I'm not a-
Well, I guess I am, I don't know if I am a simple man
But all I know is what I'm saying is that I ain't fuckin' playin'
Around when I make these sounds that you hearing, man
This is my passion, it's clearer than
Ever before, why? 'Cause they make- look like jokers
When they saying all this shit they don’t understand
It's like a fuckin' joke, and it's like everything that I've done doesn't matter
And it's like they puttin' me on a fuckin' platter
Like, oh man, another slice of me, yeah
Man, all they doing is slicing me, man
I ain't, huh, where I'm supposed to be, yeah
Why? 'Cause, haha, no, I'm not supposed to have
These damn friends who say that they friends
I feel like Rigby at the end of that one episode of the "Regular Show": (Man, you ha—)
Oh my God, that's so loud, I really hope nobody heard it
I did not do that on purpose, uh
"Black Beatles" is a song that I could play
But what else can I say?
I'm 'bout to bring back studio, yeah
Got a bitch in the studio, yeah
Huh, sing "estudio", ayy
I don't know what that means, but I'm curio'
Yeah, yeah, that's what it is, man
Yeah, man, she took the fuckin' kids, man
Yeah, you just know it is, man, ayy
Haha, she was Islam, yeah
They don't know what I is sayin'
Look, she came over, trust me, it's on cam
Look, I'm making a sequel, that's what I'm sayin', yeah
She was my—
Yeah, oh wait
Ayy, uh
Now listen, I don't know what he saw
But let's let him talk about chainsaw
They don't want to test the beat out
Wow, what I say, they gotta bleep out
Oh man, they don't know what they see now
I think they fuckin' vision turning senile
I feel like I am an only child
I told mama "I'm just only wild"
I just want to see her happy and smile
They like, wow, he's the only child
Why?
'Cause I need to call my other family
Gang shit
Look, if I talk to them now, they wouldn't be proud of me
Alright?
'Cause I seem to be handling life sloppily
I'm telling you, bad bitch, she sloppy, she on top of me, uh
But let me stay on topic
Yeah, bad bitch, met her at Hot Topic, yeah
Woah, huh, grabbed her ass, she told me to stop it, ayy
It's a bad time to bring this up, man
But this is real stuff that happened, and I ain't bout to—
Alright? That just happened
To be my future wife, she just don't know it yet
Man, I say these things online, you know I'm finna sweat
But listen, no one's associated with me anymore
But truthfully, Karen, they asked, it really wasn't sure
So, hm, that's something I really can't ignore, huh
The bullshit just is, I just can't implore

-eady
Yo, B, they ready
Yo, B, they ready

Yeah, they ready for what?
Bad bitch, no, she is not a slut
I promise I was not lookin' at her butt
Yeah, when she talked to me, I had to say "What?"
'Cause enough is enough
I feel like I'm out of this world, this shit is tough
Hahaha, think that it's a joke? Yeah
Other day, recorded this— yeah, that's pretty bad
But listen, uh, got bags under my eyes
'Cause I'm so busy ruining my own enterprise
Yeah, ha, this is no surprise to me
Ha, this about as predictable as the rise of me
Boom! Ooh, shit, they didn’t see it comin’
Ayy, yeah
Ha, haha, I got good shit, I'm good at plumbin’
Haha, yeah
Listen, my feelings, I'm really still numbing
Might have to pour out the bottle, ain't that something?
But
They're pulling at my chain, but now I'm not running
My comeback, that's something they ain't wanting
Oh, they coming back, well, ain't that something?
It's almost like they forgot which ship they was jumping
Yeah

-eelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
I'm with some h-
Uh

Look, I ain't playin' around
I'm makin' crazy sounds, tearing down crazy towns
Plus, I just watched "Eddington"
Uh, yeah, and it might just be better than
All of RES' other movies, but it's possible that they all tens
He the best, let's not pretend, uh, yeah
And I don't think that his legacy will end, uh, yeah
You know what the fuck I'm sayin', uh
Look, they don't want to see a response
They wanted to never come, and they want it to come in seconds
At the same time, just like yo' bitch, and, man, it's game time
Man, you know what I'm sayin', man, you know I ain't lyin'
When I say that she be bendin' over like she was picking up the mail
But she— prolly checking up the male
Wait, that's not what I'm tryna sell
Oh shit, man, I'm not gay, if you couldn't tell, uh
But I watched "Brokeback Mountain", and I ain't gonna lie
Never thought I'd love a movie 'bout fuckin' a guy, uh
Look, couldn't make this up if I tried
If I said I didn't like the movie, I would be lyin', uh
No, really, it's amazing
It makes me wonder why the gays don't take a vacation
They too busy protecting themselves
They gotta go take some time for theyselves, man
I'm— I'm just sayin' words
So if I have to clarify it too, that doesn't help
Doesn't solve anything, yeah
It doesn't mean anything, huh
This is the features I bring, bring 'em to the table, uh
Do this off they dome, nah, they main— they wouldn’t be able
See, even when I be fuckin' up that shit, it's still a fable
'Cause it even reaches all the people who disabled
'Cause, uh, you ain't nothing what I did
That don't make sense but, God, please forgive
Fuck— Fuck a bad bitch, ha, that's just how live
Yeah, you do not exist
It's a bad bitch that I just kissed
No, I'm not talkin' on the lips, yeah
My— list, yeah
And my dick game do exist, yeah
I cannot resist
Haters so mad, they tryna put me on a list
Yeah, I heard about the whole Kiwi Farms fiasco, uh
Bitch, you listen to Lupe Fiasco, yeah
You too busy focusing on my cashflow, yeah
You should focus 'bout the size of your asshole
Ahahahahaha
Look, I know what I said
I'd rather release the statement than be dead
I don't really give a fuck what I said
Look, they, huh, I write it in lead
Bad bitch excited to give me some head
Uh, yeah, it's like I'm on vacation
Man, I can't even give 'em an illustration, huh
'Cause they wouldn't understand what I'm sayin'
Every day is like a fuckin' vacation
And sure, I took advantage of my wealth
But truthfully, I gave some fuckin' shit to myself, uh
I gave some advantages to myself that you will never have
Oh man, you'll just be never glad
And I just see it 'cause your face is on the phone
Yeah, you can't leave that shit alone, pickin' up the ringtone
Yeah, in jail, I used to sing songs, yeah
Now I have to write my wrongs
Bad bitches with the tightest thongs, yeah
Haha, they just hating 'cause I'm-
They just hating ‘cause I'm so impatient
It's like, man, I've been sitting here, patiently waiting
And they just treatin' me like my time doesn't matter, huh
Got a bad bitch, fucked her in the bladder?
Wow, that really did not turn left
But it's okay, okay? Because I'm really churning the batter
I'm really making cakes, I'm really making rhymes
And haters, they so mad that it's fuckin' game time
That means time to step up to the plate
Have you ever done something that's truly fuckin’ great?
Nah, you just like to talk a lot
Oh man, bad bitch in my parking spot
I told her get the fucking car out my place
And then I spit in her face, this is a true story
Real shit, they don't know how I feel, shit
It's like I don't even know how to appeal shit, uh
Uh, but, no, I can't
'Cause listen, I could say it, but, know what? I shan't
I meant to say like in a medieval way
Watched "Brokeback Mountain", I'm a medieval gay
Look, I don't even know what to say
It's like my rhyming capabilities went away
Ayy, but still, I spray like an AK
Ayy, treat it like it's payday
Uh, yeah, I almost got married
Good to know I didn't get carried away
'Cause of the shit that she would say, uh
Just to ruin my fuckin' day, my God
Telling you, it's like blackmail, on my iPod, on repeat, man
Every— heh, she was letting people think that I beat her
Just so that she can stay out of it
Oh man, I really hope she feels proud of it
Fuckin' ridiculous, the shit I put up with
Bad bitch, look, getting my nuts kissed
Then I'm drinking a Sunkist, yeah
Told her the story, she was pissed, man
They just can't handle it, uh
Wearing these sandals, bitch
Why? 'Cause I'm looking like Jesus in this bitch
And I'm saying "God, please, I need Jesus in this bitch"
But He said "Stop cursing", I need Jesus in this place
And He said, "That's worse", He said, "Son, you're a disgrace"
Uh, look, not my proudest moment
But I'll tell you one thing: that shit was something
And I've been gone

Look, I'm back
I rap like I smoked a pound of crack
I rap like I'm tryna break my mama's back
'Cause she carrying my career like a lapdog
I need a hot dog right now
Uh, the bad bitch needs to pipe down
So what'd I do? Uh, simply, I yell at her
That's just what I do, uh, hahaha, I'm just a messenger
Look, a true story
I was yelling at the bitch, yeah
Haha, what'd she do for me but ruin my life?
Ruining my shit, thinking I'd be her w— wait, no
That she'd be my wife, no, I did get that right
The first time, oh man, I'm just, wait, no, no, I didn't
This a hard line that I had once
But now, really, I been looking like a mad dunce
And I be feeling like I just— like they stole my credit card
And I remember when I was selling crack on the prison yard
Or remember when I used to avoid the ones whose dicks was hard
Yeah, that's true, I used to walk away from it
I'm not gay, that's not what I'm tryna say from it
I'm just saying I don't want my ass on the pavement
In front of all of these other people
Look, doing tricks with the dick like Evil Knievel
Look, I do what I can, feel like I'm Lil Dicky in "Jail Pt. 1"
Because that’s how they thinkin' of me too
#MeToo movement
I'm part of the #MeToo movement
Yeah, she mad 'cause I can't move it
My songs, they just might lose it
My songs, they saying they're just not quite music
What? Sto— stop with your loose lips
Uh, loose leaf paper in my back pocket
Haters mad but they just gonna have to sock it
Uh, huh, what can I say?
I don't play on the playground making all these gay sounds
In the prison yard, yeah, we back there
Gotta tell you, man, they used to pull back my hair
That's why I cut it in the first place
To try to take my mind away from the worst place, yeah
Nothing makes sense anymore
Let me make it clear: I don't want this rent anymore
What is that? Oh, that's the space that I'm taking
On YouTube, just tryna get the motherfuckin' bacon, uh
Bad bitch in lace-up keeps quaking 'round me
And they see "Oh man, he's just sleeping soundly"
But, really, man, I've been where everyone in the town be, yeah
Huh, yeah, they gon' crown me, uh

Look, I ain't playing around no mo'
They be asking why the fuck I sound so cold
Why I look like a hobo, why I dress like a homo
Man, all of these these questions, man, please go slow-mo
Uh, I'm tryna answer them all right now
I am tall 'cause I am, yeah, and you are a cow
You are a cow, and you look just like— yeah, well, how I do now
But truthfully, I don't care, man, I like how it sounds
When I call you an animal
Mad bitch slurpin' on me like a Danimal'
Bitch, I eat the pussy like a cannibal
Yeah, haha, yeah
Don't even know how to close this off
It's like, hm, when'd I go so soft?
Oh, shit, I can remember the time
It was when I thought that being me was a crime
Everyone's sayin' they scared that I'm revertin'
Oh shit, I am, the truth is that they just fuckin' hurtin'
Man, shit, is it fuckin' workin'?
Don't know if I get my point across
Am I just looking lost again to everybody out here?
Look, l—let me make it clear
Things are not how they appear
Yeah, bad bitch, yeah, she took it in the rear
Look, haha, it's true
Listen, fuck every part of you
You look re— too, yeah
I made sure to add that in, yeah
So that you know this ain't just babblin', yeah
That, of my own life, I'm the cap-a-nin, uh
What the fuck is even happening
To r— around me? I— man, I was sleeping soundly
Now they waking me up with drama, telling me that, oh, my mama
She be crying on the porch, damn, I'm gonna find her
Reaching to live still
Even though they want me to take the blue pill, motherfucker
Look, I don't even know what that means, it sounds cool
But maybe I do, and I don't want to take you to sound school
Uh, to let you know how I made this beat, yeah
And hold on, it's almost complete, just got to—

Look, I'm back
I'm gonna add one more ambient drone to the track
See, 'cause this one ended, uh, and I can't pretend that
This ain't gonna make this shit feel completely different, uh
There it is
Listen, motherfucker, nut sucker
Nut tucker, too, you a motherfucker, too, yeah
Oh, I said that already, well, you needed two reminders, yeah
Bad bitches, looking at two behinders
That's just how it go
Haters mad, think I've gone slow
Thinking I don't know what I'm doing
Like music ain't the shit I'm pursuing
Thinking I'll stick to music videos
Oh, sorry, I mean stick to getting hoes

Alright, okay

Now it's getting real
They is mad at me because I still have appeal
Look, look around, I just don't know who to kill, it's like, man
To all these people, man, I used to think they was my friends
But, nah, I was— I guess that all good things end
Huh, unless these motherfuckers was pretend
From the very fuckin' start, yeah, I asked him from my heart
Please tell me, do you look at me? It's just like Kevin Hart
Yeah, and entertainment, a leg sprainer for your enjoyment
Oh man, a gu— another guy, trying to avoid employment
Yeah, well, that's just how it goes
Bad bitch, she imported from Mexico, yeah
Oh shit, move, that's where the Lexus goes, hey
Bitch, I got the Texas flow
But I can't drop no names yet
Why? Because I still want to write insane checks
And they— huh, and they coming after me
Uh, huh, assault and battery
Is what they claim, they say that I've been—
Hahaha, running away from the truth
And I commit assault and battery against my girl
You know, the one I love? The one who's my entire world?
And she believes this, don't know how she's deceived herself into this
But really, no, I see it
See, here's the reality:
It's called, hm, the "having a platform" mentality
See, people think that it's the thing that you should strive for
Nah, man, it was the thing I was no longer gonna be alive for
Oh man, working 5:00 to 4:00
Yeah, huh, man, what a chore
I think I'd rather see what life is like if- ahahaha
I think I'd rather just end it right now, huh
Yeah, so I said it out loud
I recorded a twenty minute suicide note, man
I wish I could remember the quotes, man
But just understand that it really wasn't gross, man
It was honest, I said, "Hm, man, this is why I wasn't honest"
Maybe I should look around more
Maybe I should focus on the sound more
Uh, sorry, not to sound poor
But, yeah, I need a girl, huh, can I please have it?
See, I'm like a fiend and a drug addict
Yeah, I need this shit, gotta fuck like a rabbit
Yeah, man
These bars I'm spitting, promise you this shit will be a bad habit
No, let me make that clear, it will be a bad habit
And, hm, I will do whatever, I have it
'Cause I make the beats, I make the rhymes and need no help
See, people thinking that they understand me better than myself, uh
Fuckin' ridiculous, there, I said it again
Ayy, bad bitch, she ain't even pretend
Look, plus, she was maybe a ten
And she ain't even a friend, bro
Well, none of them are
Remember when we was sitting together in the car, man?
I said, "Wow, you guys are great for this"
Man, my life, I felt I paid for this
Like everybody's looking at me like I'm some guy
And it makes me feel like I want to die
But, nah, see, I could not talk to people, felt like a great people
These people swooped in and said, "Man, you are us"
And I said, "Man", huh, "It's like these people I trust"
And the next thing I know, this man who's robust
Says "Huh, man, see, I'm the leader of the group"
And I say "Hm, I should shoot", yeah
Turn your whole motherfuckin' life into soup, huh
Just 'cause I believe that I'm tryna recoup
Fuckin' ridiculous, once again, these people, they think
That they owe me, or I owe 'em, me
My God, it's like I owe 'em a drink
Ayy, bad bitch, she a twink
Dang, you know what it is
Had to show her the biz, not in front of her kids
Please, that's not why I visited
Ayy, hahaha, yo, I shatted in her residence
Bad bitch, I'm throwin' the presidents, yeah
Bad bitch needs—
The bitch bad, lookin' for some evidence
Look, is it ever this?
Is it ever as bad as they say it is? See, that's what this shit got me thinkin'
I've been like- hm, I quit drinking, by the way
Now I couldn't even do it anymore, it's like, wow, man
Huh, don't know, it's like I have a job, man
It's like I'm trying to do something good
You know? Instead of just giving back to the hood
And the hood, I mean, in a ra— in not a racist way
I'm tryna say it's the Internet, do you know what I'm getting to yet?
Look, I'm trying to say this place is a slum
I'm saying the Internet truthfully looks like the whole pie
But really, it's just crumbs, it's full of fat bums
Haha, living— something's wrong
With the way the system is going
Man, my bank account really is growing
Got to hit the— ha, hit the drone again
Got a bad bitch, she got me in the zone again, uh

They don't even understand
Bitch, I'm the man, I ain't even motherfuckin' playin'
Ain't motherfuckin' playin', ain't motherfuckin' playin'
You know me, I ain't moved to the fuckin' 
But that's just how it is, man
When you be in the fuckin' biz, man
Hold on, pop quiz, man
Sorry, what the fuck you is saying?
Mad shit
That's all I hear, man, it's a bunch of mad shit
It's like, hm, I'm surrounded by this bad shit
I used to be, uh, the source of all magic
Man, I made some projects, they were mad sick
And, man, I made this video, it was mad sick
And, man, I did so much good to everyone
I tried to do something nice, but here I've come
Look, it's like, wow, look how it's all falling down
I must be a completely different guy, huh, wow
It's like I didn't even try to do good in this world
I just "beat a girl", yeah, that's how it is
Just really imagine if they could truly have my biz
Be in me in my shoes, understand the pain that I felt
Really felt like I couldn't say nothing else, yeah
Talked over so much, the only way to overcome it is to yell
Yeah
And so, that's what I did, if you couldn't tell
By the shit that she's saying on the end as well, yeah, look
Nah— things ain't going well for me, as you can tell from me
Hey, but, bad bitch, you know she payin' bail for me
Yeah, she miss my company
Yeah, I'm 'bout to rhyme that with "cum for me"
Yeah, bad bitch, she want to comfort me
Yeah, it's like, "Hold on, is there room for three?"
I'm like, "Huh? Let me check again"
Hm, yeah, sorry, let me just inspect again"
Uh, I have to look another time, if you know just what I mean
'Cause I know I keep my whip clean, uh
That's where the party goes, that's where I play my music at
Haters mad at me 'cause they ain't listen to this crazy rap
Bitch, fuck it

The beat was so hard, man, I didn't want to stop
I was so mad when she snitched to the cops
Man, it took too many years of my life
Thought she would be my wife, man, this just isn't quite right
Uh, truly thought that we would make it anywhere
Man, I was not prepared for whenever she got scared, man
It's like she saw a different man in me, uh
Bad bitch, but she looks like a manatee
Yeah, yeah, oh, man, she not a fan of me
Yeah, bad bitch, but she cares too much about her vanity
Yeah, haters mad, they care about my sanity
Uh, more than my friends do, let's not pretend, dude
Real shit, man, they paying attention, uh
So, maybe I should just truly mention what I'm feeling
And drag everybody back in like a failure
To— of my part to keep it all concealed, yeah
Fuck y'all hating-ass hoes
I'm in this bitch and she has no clothes
That's not what I really meant, but I suppose
Look, don't know how this goes from here
Look, putting in— they fuckin' nose in my rear
All day, like it was the hallway
And they're like, "Hm, h— how do I find the spot
That really fucking hurts you a lot?" Man, that's all that I got
I'm fuckin' left with nothin'
Haters mad at me, come on, pushing the button
Come on, haters mad at me, as they should
I am taking care now of my neighborhood
I am actually giving a shit about the people who surround me
Man, it's like none of this bullshit, it surrounds me
Anymore, yeah, this haters, they around me
All the time, man, shit be like salami
'Cause they be slapping my knob
Dang, that's not what I meant when I say she doing her job
Wait, no, it is, oh, man, how— l—look how bad her focus is
Yeah, hahaha,
