I know what makes you cry
I know when you mean it
Who knows you better than
I do!

I remember
I remember that box of letters
I remember that naked photo
And I remember things getting better
I remember
I remember when I met your dad
I remember all about your mom
I remember what you do on Christmas
You might also like
I know what makes you cry
I know when you mean it
Who knows you better than
I know everything that freaks you out
That makes you mad
That makes you
