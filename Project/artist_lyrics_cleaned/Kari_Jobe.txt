The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His pеrfect love could not be ovеrcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King
Has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive, He is alive!

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King
Has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive, He is alive!
Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive, He is alive

You have overcome
You are resurrected king
You have overcome the grave
You have overcome
