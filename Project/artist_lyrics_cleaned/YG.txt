Nigga, kill off all beef

I’m a Westside get brackin' in the back like what’s happnin'
That 40 Glock snap like Insta, ain't no need for a caption
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it
'Hamad threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect
That's how I got put on
Tree Top Bompton, yeah I got put on
It was hard in the hood
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood
I know Game from cedar block, Dot from the West
That was  that popped what's his name in his chest
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on
Niggas gotta go, we can't prolong

I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'
Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence
That's a principal of proof, the definition of logic
That this nigga is a bitch, every chance he get he's dodgin'
I brought back this West Coast shit
And this the mothafuckin' thanks I get?
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga ain't snitch
That's how it's s'posed to go down
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down
Give you a blind date, have my bitch pick you up
Then have one of my Top members stick you up
I know Nipsey from 6-0, C-Hood from 10-4
Tiny Bone from 40 Crip, that’s my kinfolk
My whole family tried to save me but it didn't work
Momma know I've been bangin' lately,

Pull up on the block, like, "What!"
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

Verse two, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
Click clack, bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now
Like, right now, right now
Like, what you tryin' to do right now?

I went to sleep flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low-cut and wear my socks like a cholo
I coulda got a Ghost but I went and got a Lo-Lo
'Cause copying off you rap niggas is a no-no
I can hop out solo (What's happenin'?), tucked is a 44
I probably need three more, 'cause these niggas is emo
They see my altitude and have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?

Drink the Act' right by the case with my niggas
Drink the Act' right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty tryna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don't matter, go figure

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga (Wassup?)
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (It's the muthafuckin' world)
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my niggas)
My nigga got cake, my nigga got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga, we eatin', my nigga get a plate
And we're still hittin' licks with my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off with a nigga shit with my nigga, my nigga
I fuck a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talkin' shit, then he ain't my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga (YG) and I ain't goin' in, ain't tryna leave my niggas (Nah)
Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga (Let go)
But it wasn't enough room 'cause I came with my niggas (That's right too)
My niggas, my niggas (Hey)
I need a set of wings 'cause I'm too fly, nigga (Let go)
And I'm all about my business like a suit and tie nigga (Rich Homie Quan)
I ride for my niggas (Believe that)

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
