Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman

You better respect your Mama

'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real

She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing

In the back of that red ragtop
She said, "Please, don't stop"

Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother to be
For two weeks (Ooh)
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild (Ooh)
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

But it was all make believe in the end (In the end)
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time, drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red ragtop
On the day she stopped
Loving me

Angry all the time

Our boys are strong now
The spittin' image of you when you were young

She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, "Let's go and get it on"

Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans

Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her Coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

Take anybody that you want

When he was eight years 

She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, "Do you wanna?" and she says, "Hell, yeah"
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Crowded backyard, everybody's laughin'
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, "Baby, let's go."

And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights

Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights, oh
One of those nights
This is gonna be, hey
This is gonna be
One of those nights
Oh, 

She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, "Baby why are you trembling like you are?"

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snow
She's all things to behold

Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Rain (Oh) on me (Rain on me)
She's my kind of rain

I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey, my next thirty years, I'm gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years, I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here
In my next thirty years

Here we go
Alright

Oh, my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Huh, maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here
In my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Oh, here we go, 

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

She walks into the room and everybody
Watches every move, hoping she don't love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they don't realize there's more to her
Than what meets the eye, that's why I am certain
No matter what they do to reach her now

She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking right back to my arms
She can turn every head but she never lets it go to her heart

But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own

But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
Baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been

I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
You might also like
Now a days, when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line

Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you wanna lead
Guess you could say the same for me

But you and I made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road

Maybe in Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try?
Never did so maybe that's why you're on
Every highway, just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you in
Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
In Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
In Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you 

All my friends call me Bear Claw
The village chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey, and pass it around

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby, she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards, don't you know?
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my tipi
Late at night, tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw

So proud to live, so proud to

He said, "I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do?
And he said

I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

He said, "I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
