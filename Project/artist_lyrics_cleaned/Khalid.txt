But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku
You might also like[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop

We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?

Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and

Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you

The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

But I'll keep your number saved

I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere
