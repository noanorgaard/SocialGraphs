Like shattered glass against my back
The way you got me just blows my mind
Didn't care enough to even say goodbye

We did it for the rush
We did it for the buzz

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
And live wide open
Set em on fire, crazy like we used to
It don’t matter where we’re going
Up on a mountain, down by the beach side
Till we find the love that we fell into
Hey, I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you
I just want to run away with you

I miss your midnight kiss and loving you all night long
This life’s like a rip tide and we’re barely hanging on
Caught up in the worry, and always in a hurry and losing what we’re all about
Lets slow it down
Take our love and get out of this town

I just wanna run, I just want to run away with you

Yeah, they got a caught up in the moment, couldn't help themselves
They got caught up in the moment, got wild as hell
It was everything they wanted right then and there
They got caught up in the moment, caught up, caught up
At 20,000 feet on a South West flight she whispered to him, "We ain't got all night"
So he reached up and turned off the overhead light
And by the time they landed sure enough it was more than lust, but less then love
Ther were full-fledged members of the "you know what club"!

He was 10 grand up at a blackjack table, she was dressed to the nines
Drinkin' fine Black Lable he said, "I think I'm gonna cash out and buy you a diamond ring"
So they headed down the strip to the wedding chapel in a stretch limousine that was
Candy Apple, got married by a preacher man that looked just like the king!You might also 

Someone ran away with her innocence
A memory she can't get out of her head
And I can only imagine
What she's feelin' when she's prayin'
Kneeling at the edge of her bed

And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
Like holy water
Holy water

She wants someone to call her angel
Someone to put the light back in her eyes
She's lookin' through the faces
And unfamiliar places
She needs someone to hear her when she cries

Of someone who understands

And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of Crown
And everybody's getting down
And this town ain't never gonna be the same

'Cause I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and bling-blinging
While the girls are drinking long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

I'm a thoroughbred, that's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We were flying high, fine as wine
Having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love
