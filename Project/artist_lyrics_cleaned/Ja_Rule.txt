Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (Love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (Love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (Love it when you thug me, baby)
And I can't deny, I (Love it when I'm witchu, baby)

I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma, I'm tryin' to see you
Bent over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest nights, so ferocious
Now you street promotin', the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me, lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's CRA-ZAY, but BAY-BAY, I... (Love it when I'm witchu, baby)

Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me, baby

And I was told that the sex, better than drugs

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life
You know, you're right, and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
Baby, I can only help but wonder
What life would be without (My sweet baby)
And you're my baby (Holla if you hear me)
Ah-ah-ah
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I'm feelin' babe, it's just a woman thang
It's a man's world, but I understand
But there's still nothin' different, boy, let's stick to the plan
You be my down ass, witcha round ass
I know I'm feelin you (Like you feelin' me)

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (Shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fucking you all wild

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like, the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I.N.C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare
But who cares? You care

Oh I, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be coming home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checking for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares? You care

Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits
Nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking 

What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body, and soul, ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you dropped like eighty
On a down payment, thinkin', "Damn, ain't life gravy?"
And ever since, for my honey, I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot as July, it's the world against you and I
