'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster, barely breathing
Give me something to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left of this man
Make me whole, once again

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's left of me
Oh, oh, oh-oh

I've been dying inside, you see
I'm going out of my mind, out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of
