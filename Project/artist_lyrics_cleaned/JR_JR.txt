I can't be everything you want me to be
I can't be everything you want me to be
Finally, I can see the light through the leaves
But it's all gone
But it's all gone

What comes from the ground, now is returning
It's all the same sound and my ears are burning
In some strange home, don't know who I'm working for
I've made up my mind over and over

I can't be everything you want me to be
I can't be everything you want me to be
Finally, I can see the light through the leaves
But it's all gone
But it's all gone
You might also like
Over and over, over and over
Over and over, over and over

I can't be everything you want me to be
I can't be everything you want me to be
Finally, I can see the light through the leaves
But it's all gone
But it's all gone
But it's all
