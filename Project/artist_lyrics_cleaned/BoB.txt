So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner

And my team's going green and I ain't talking 'bout pottery
You tryin' to hit the party, she tryin' to hit the lottery
And if they watchin' girl, I'm grandfather clockin'

And after Strange Clouds, I'ma drop my rock album
Violent bravado, call me Bobby Bravo
Every play is crucial, yeah, that's my motto

I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
I guess, and I ain't too big on duality but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it
Y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly

Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling

Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling

And it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
And in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beasting up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, 'cause time is ticking

Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling

As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be

1 ContributorB.o.B - Strange Clouds (Tradução) feat Lil Wayne Lyrics
Bem, se você acha que sou eu, você achou certo
Fico aqui como um garanhão, você jurava que eu era só um cavalo
Eu chego nela com a bomba, chame isso de Nancy Kerrigan
Uso o verde mais verde, pode me chamar de vegetariano
Você está na segunda divisão, a gente fuma como profissional
Faço um trabalho excepcional, pontual como número decimal
O jeito como eu levo a batida, cara, eu toco nas ruas e não faço nem esforço
É, esses manos não vão me levar no bico, aqui não tem nada de A Origem
Eu sou um top chef, você só faz miojo, eu tô na prateleira do topo
Nada de saideira, pergunta pro barman o que ainda tem
Pode servir, não pare por aí, segure o copo, tome mais uma
Curtimos a noite toda porque estamos em toda parte, você não

De calça jeans, estou sumindo, cuidando dos meus negócios
Fumando um bagulho forte como o Arnold Schwarzenegger
É o Tunechi Lee, seu puto, você tá quente como um iglu
Esqueça essa arma, chamo isso de Ju Jitsu
Olá, Mundo, to com uma loira, tipo lápis 2B
Esses rappers vão descer pelo cano
Meu mano, o dia todo, a noite toda, meia bomba
Eu entro naquela mina, balanço a barriga, rasgo e tudo mais
Falo pros meus camaradas que é uma festa
Tenho Tech pras dificuldades técnicas
Eu tô no topo da paradas, você é o melhor dos miojos
Piru, gângsters, bandidos

Bem, não resta dúvida, é o B. o. B. com certeza
No estúdio, eu tenho minhas necessidades
Se você quer a coisa de verdade, fez a seleção certa
Serei Decatur até morrer, represento mesmo
Dizem que sou celebridade, que merda é uma celebridade?
Acho que vou investir na forma certa de proteção
Eu digo que é uma maldição, mas é uma bênção emocional
Um negão da periferia tentando alcançar o topo
Mas eu não preciso nem de indicações
Eu acordo e enrolo o baseado
Esses manos acordam no meu pé
Tomem café da manhã antes, pelo menos
Mano, cuide da sua alimentação e preste atenção na minha letra
Porque o que você espera alcançar, eu já fiz

I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain's on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still, I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man, I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind

Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the bob​
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm)

Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest and I'ma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'ma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'ma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'ma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati

What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There is an announcement, I'd like to announce (It)
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

I don't need a sub, I don't need a speaker
'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na-na-na-na boo-boo, wouldn't want to be ya'
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down, fuck was that, a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B-dot, been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'ma need help
Someone call Charter, maybe call F.E.M.A
'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA, vis-à-vis

This is craziness
Addicted to the pain of love and hate relationship
Or can I break a heart or can we argue breakin' shit?
I guess I take the fault for what my occupation is
The more the money come, the more bizarre the day can get
Bizarre the day can get
It cost bread to join the game but even more to escape the shit
I see calculated cowards taking calculated risks
This the art of making music or the art of faking shit?
This the truth, I give these boys the blues, this is proof
But it's nothing they can tell me, it's nothing they can do
To take my touch away, take my love away, I play to win
Backstage, first we say the prayer, then we say amen

Spendin' money 'fore I make it, never learn to wait for shit
Tryna pack a stadium, you tryna catch the latest trends
The line between the good and bad is paper-thin
Goodness gracious, I might have enemies in high places
They surveillance but can't keep up with how my mind races
How I'm steppin' on these niggas like I've got my own rep
Nigga be omega, beta salutations to the haters, chuck the deuce
You say what's up with me, what's up with you?
It's nothing they could tell me, it's nothing they can do
To take my touch away, to take my love away, I play to win
Swagger woodstock status, guess that's why they call me Bands

Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me, I stay stuntin', lowkey, I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga, I speak ebonics
Got a new car, I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills, I need that, fuck your team, where the freaks at?
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' with out with his lady
I got your boo in my Bugatti, she 'bout to swallow my babies
My system loud, my weed loud, no hair clippers
I'm faded
I'm in my zone, I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz, quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this
