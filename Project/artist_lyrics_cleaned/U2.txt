Lover, I'm off the street
I'm gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire

She's the candle burnin' in my room
I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
Over the counter with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one

I'm a fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire
(Right)
And the fever gettin' higher
Desire
Desire

Burning
Burning

She's the dollars, she's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise in the year of elections
Oh,  sister, I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love of money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money

And the fever gettin' higher

She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you wanna kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child, yeah

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh

One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
Love (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
Oh love, love love
Oh, oh (We move through miracle days)
Oh love love
Move you (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
Spirits move
Let it move (Spirit moves in mysterious ways)
Does it move you?
Oh, ah
Does it move you? (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
She moves me
Lift my days, light up my nights, 

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' 

And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Don't look before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs, purple irises
The camera can't see
I've seen you walk unafraid
I've seen you in the clothes you made
Can you see the beauty inside of me?
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?

Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Time, time, time, time
Time won't leave me as I am
But time won't take the boy out of this man

Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

The more you know, the less you feel
Some pray for, others steal
Blessings are not just for the ones who kneel


Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away

And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you

Oh-oh-oh-oh

With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful
