How you feel me slipping because I've been tripping on you
Holding back, I'm hoping that
The feelings turn table and it will be really stable 'cause
(We had something)

Turn away 'cause I'm getting too deep
I'm too cold to be 25
It's getting old and I'll expire soon
It's been a while since I felt your skin
I don't think I ever let you in
'Cause I'm always waiting for your text

You went really distant and I'm missing on you
It's been a minute since I felt your kisses on me
You went really distant and I'm missing
(You went really distant and I'm missing you)

(We had something strong, we had something strong
Missing on ya, missing on ya
You've been so distant)
And I've been missing on you
You might also like
You know it's getting really old
Cold, went from fire to cold
And you know I don't need to be told, no
I don't need to be told
I don't deserve the shit you throw
It's been a while and I have come to know
Every time I'm ready to let go, you won't let me go

You went really distant and I'm missing on you
It's been a minute since I felt your kisses on me
You went really distant and I'm missing
(You went really distant and I'm missing you)

(We had something strong, we had something strong
Missing on ya, missing on ya
You've been so distant)
And I've been missing on you

You've been so distant and I've been missing on ya
You've been so distant and I've been missing on ya

Been missing on ya
I've been missing on ya
(Knowing it's, knowing it's strong
Knowing it's, knowing it's
Knowing it's, knowing it's strong
Knowing it's, knowing
