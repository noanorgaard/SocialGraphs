Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Kudos, my hero
Leavin' all the best
You know my hero
The one that's on

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well, I talked about it, carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you
I fell into

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please"
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again

One of these days, the clocks will stop
And time won't mean a thing
One of these days, their bombs will drop
And silence everything

But it's alright, yeah, it's alright
Said it's alright

Easy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!
Your pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!
One of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!
I bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!

And pain will disappear
One of these days, you will forget
To hope and learn to fear
