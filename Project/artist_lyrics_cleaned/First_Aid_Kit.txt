We know what we're doing
And we're doing it right
You may have written books on the subject
But then you may still be surprised
By your tone over the phone
To your sister while waiting in line
At the shopping mall just outside of town

In the hands of teachers
In the books you read
And the things we say
When we've lost the lead
I still try to speak up
When my voice won't make a sound
And I've thought it over, too many times
But when there is no use, and the lights are all out

But what you tell yourself you are must be what you'll be
Who's to say who is who and what is what if you simply don't agree

That I could read you just like a book
For now I can only guess what's coming next
By examining your timid smile
And the ways of the old, old winds blowing you back around

And I'm a goddamn fool, but then again so are you
And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
Has me seeking out and searching for you
And I never really knew what to do

Sometimes I wish I could find my Rosemary Hill
I'd sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I'd sing
And every once in a while I'd sing a song for you
That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea
And if I wanted it to it would lead you back to me

And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
Is something that I have heard before
A children's tale, the lonesome wail of a lion's
