Thinking to myself as you coming down that pole
Have no idea what you in for when I get you home, shorty

Kiss you anywhere you want, shorty, I don’t care
Do it in the closet, all over the floor
Up in your apartment, all out in the hall
Hit it from the back while I’m smoking my cigar
You can look out the window while I’m getting’ it in the car
I don’t give a damn where we are
