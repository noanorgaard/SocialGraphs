Steal the night, kill the lights, feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight 'cause it's pulling you in
Pump it up, you can't stop 'cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose) Like an overdose

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Evacuate the dance floor
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Stop, this beat is killing me
Hey, Dr. DJ, come burn this place right down to the ground

(Oh) My body's aching, system overload (Overload)
Temperature's rising, I'm about to explode
Watch me, I'm intoxicated, diggin' the show (Uh-huh)
It's got me hypnotized (Uh-huh), everybody step aside

I'll take you back to 1969
Let's hit the city of freedom like old times
It's gettin' dirty underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me countin' the butterflies
One, two, three, let's bring it on
Keep on dancin' in the streets of love
French kissin' on JFK Drive
Till we crash at the beach where we watch the sun rise

Tell me what you're waiting for
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby, take me back to the city of love (Right)
To the place that I've been dreamin' of (San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Everybody go ho-oh, oh-oh)

It's 10 PM, gettin' ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's gettin' high
Cruisin' down Broadway, you on my side
Pullin' over my pink Rover at the Hungry I
One, two, three, let's bring it on
DJ, play my favourite beats all night long
Poppin' some bottles, Champagne, red wine
And we both giddyup on the rooftop and watch the city lights

Tell me what you're waiting for
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco

To the place that I've been dreamin' of (San Francisco)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Everybody go ho-oh, oh-oh)

(Whoa)
(Yeah)
(Woo) Are you goin'
(Woo) To San Francisco?
We're playing songs of life like it's '69
We sing and dance under the neon lights (San Francisco)
Stars shine so bright over the city tonight
(We're crossin' the Golden Gate, party at the 'Frisco Bay)

Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where you got flowers in your hair, girl, party everywhere, girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco

Come on, take me back to the city of love
To the place, the place that I've, I've been dreaming of (San Francisco)
So wake me up in San Francisco

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life


Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life
