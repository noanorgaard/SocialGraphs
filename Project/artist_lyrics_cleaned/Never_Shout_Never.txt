I've been searching for
A girl that's just like you
Cos I know
That your heart is true

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super-duper cute
And I can't stand it

Let's sell all our shit
And run away
To sail the ocean blue
Then you'll know
That my heart is true
You might also like
Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super-duper cute
And I can't stand it

You, you got me where you want me
Cause I'll do anything to please you
Just to make it through
Another year
You, I saw you across the room
And I knew that this is gonna
Blossom into something beautiful
You're beautiful

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about
The more I want to let you know
That everything you do
Is super-duper cute
And I can't stand it
No I can't stand it
No I can't stand 

Girl, you better love what you got
Before you go and give it away
But don't say that I don't know you

'Cause, oh, I know all about your type
You're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night
And, oh, I know that you are feeling sad
I don't feel bad
'Cause even after three text messages, four missed calls
You still slept with my best friend

Yeah, you sure got a lot of nerve
To say that this was all my fault
I know you called, I got them all
La da da da da da

Girl, you better love what you got

So I sing, "Rain, rain, go away, come again another day"
When I say it's okay to give a little hell to pay
And every single time you make your way into my sheets
The hours move to minutes, the days turn into weeks
And I know you're so cool, but I must be a fool
For taking you in and letting you win control of my heart
And every single time you make your way into my sheets
The hours move to minutes, the days turn into weeks
(Cheater, cheater)
"Rain, rain, go away, come again another day"
(Best friend-eater)
