And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
Ya gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night lasts forever
Huh, huh, huh, oh!
You might also like
Ain't nobody (Ain't nobody)
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (Nobody)
Ain't nobody (Ain't nobody)
Loves me better (Than you)

I wait for night time to come
To bring you to me
I can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever
Huh, huh, huh, oh!

Ain't nobody (Nobody)
Loves me better (Better than me)
Makes me happy (Makes me feel this way)
Makes me feel this way (You are my baby)
Ain't nobody (Body, baby)
Loves me better (Loves me)
Loves me better (Than you)
At first, you put your arms around me
Then, you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
On a night so warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody (Nobody!)
Loves me better
Makes me happy (Make me feel this way!)
Makes me feel this way (This way!)
Ain't nobody (Ain't nobody)
Loves me better than you (
