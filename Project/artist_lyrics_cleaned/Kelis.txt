I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm,,
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh, let me slow it down so you can catch the flow
Screw it up, make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor, get down on the floor)
Ooh, I gave you a taste, you want some more?
Touch down on me, throw it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin'
