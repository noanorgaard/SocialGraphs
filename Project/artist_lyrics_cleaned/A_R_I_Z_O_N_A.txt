Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh

Oh, all the things, remember all the things we used to do
Give in to me, give in to me and I'll give in to you
If you need it, oh if you need to win, then I can lose
If it brings me back to you

Oh, I-I-I, I wanna get lost in the night now
Hold me in the dark, turn the lights down
And give me your electric touch
Oh, I-I-I, I don't wanna think about the distance
I just wanna be in your existence
So give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh
Give me your electric touch, oh

Few thousand miles, and an ocean away
But I see the sunrise, just like the other day
Picture your eyes as I fall asleep
Tell myself it's alright
As the tears roll by

Oh, oh, oh
I wish I could feel your face
Oh, oh, oh
I'm helpless when I'm oceans away

I never felt
A room so still
See the future coming
Hope it isn't real
I learned to fake a smile
As the time runs out
I don't wanna wait
Oh, I don't wanna mistake

Helpless when I'm oceans away

All the days you spend on my mind
All the times that I'd say that we'll be together, we'll be together, oh
All the ways you see through my heart
I know the good intentions, they won't last forever, won't last forever

And I know I haven't been perfect, but give it some time
Cause not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
And we spend our lives looking for things we can't find
Oh, but not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind
Oh, not a single day goes by where you don't cross my mind

All the hours we've spent on the line
All the times that you'd say that I never listen, I never listen
Through the conversations we've had 'til 4 AM
You say you want something different, want something different
