And oh my lover, if I come knocking at your door
Please turn away now if I come asking for more
Oh my lover, you never call my bluff
Gave what you have now, but it was never enough

Now your mind is reaching for that door
As you pick your rings up off the floor
You never even questioned what that door was for
You gave me what you had and you could give no more

And oh my lover, why you leaving so soon?
This place is a prison, oh a lifetime or two
Oh my lover, when will you return?
I'll be back, some evening in a fever, a pearl

And why’d you let me walk on that wild side
With my head in the air full of some child's pride?
Let the sun come up, let the sun rise
As it rips the curtain of your eye
You might also like
And oh my lover, is it always the same?
With your pointing your finger the way that I came
Oh my lover, you never call my bluff
Gave what you have now, but it was never enough
Never enough

And oh the places you'll go
And oh the things that you'll do
Oh just to have and to hold
But now you must move
And oh the places you'll go
And oh the things that you'll do
And oh the hand that you hold
Does not belong to 

If I were to die today
Slaughtered in that masquerade
The last thing that you'd hear me say:
Put my body on display in the parade
Passing slowly through the town
My feet, they cannot touch the ground of the parade

All of my friends were there, waiting on me
Oh, Laurie was there, waiting on me
Anna was there, waiting on me
I have come, I will go, just the same

If I were to die today
Puppet in that grey charade
The last thing that you'd hear me say is
Bury me in different shades of the parade
Passing slowly through the town
My feet, they can not touch the ground
Go now, you'll go but, oh, just how?
Never leave this, never leave this town of the parade

Oh, walk down through the alley
And wasn‘t I in search for
Oh, somebody just like you?
Open up your window, throw down your hair
I'll climb it anywhere
I feel just like a boy
Still life with the rejects from the Island of misfit
