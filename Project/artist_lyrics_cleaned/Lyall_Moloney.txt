Floating like a seahorse
I don't wanna see more
Be poor, why'd i wanna be for
I don't want no evil, leave yawl
While i'm on the sea floor
Lets take a detour
I'm going down where you find it
Sun is smiling
Hearts are shining
Ride the wave despite the weather
Make up your mind
Let it ride and
Through life we fight
Make it through the all together
One for all, all for one
Fighting for a freedom but with no gun
See a brother with a burden take it on
I want to live with a method that makes life song
I seen it, on the edga of the blade
And throughout the yellow windows with wooden windowpanes
So i'll make ir quick, and make it plain -
Sometimes i send a little pain my way
But i don't mind it, don't mind it
Unless i hold it, gotta hold it
Gotta fina it, but not fight it
I want to find a way to make this come together
And i'm sorry for what you been through
And i'm sorry for what it made you
I need u, i won't bleed you
No black dog can live forever

Floating like a seahorse
I don't wanna see more
Be poor, why'd i wanna be for
I don't want no evil, leave yawl
While i'm on the sea floor
Lets take a detour
I'm going down where you find it
Sun is smiling
Hearts are shining
Ride the wave despite the weather
It's over they don't know me
I've got Blue Hands and they'll mould me
Cuffed up on the bath, beat like mead
Throw me to the ground n my knees bleed
I know it's over and i know it's wasted
I spent years at work and then went and erased it
Sometimes i wish that my page could be folded
Locked away so i no longer known it
My history be a pedigree
Purer than a honeybee
And i know the scolding makes me strong and moulded
God will place his hands on my soul and hold it, like a steamboat he keep my cogs rolling
Down the Murray Darling till the steam stops flowing
Backflilp from a tree childhood moment
The Fire is a memory i am grateful i'm holding
No Black dog can live forever
I'm going down where you find it
Sun is smiling
Hearts are shining
Ride the wave despite the weather
Make up your mind
Let it ride and
Through life we fight
Make it through the all together
I'm going down where you find it
Sun is smiling
Hearts are shining
Ride the wave despite the weather
Down where you f-
