Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, and you'll find love
And don't forget that there is a someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
And be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?
Go ahead, take it all home

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need now is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
'Cause all that I want from you my son is just to be satisfied
