I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't babe)
And I know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but I got a better plan;
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song
You might also likeSing along to that one song (oh yeah)

And it goes like:
She's in a Smiths tee underneath her flannel
She could drink whatever but she loves Jack Daniels
I wanna get out this party and go home and light some candles
These people are too much for me to handle, yeah
You're sorta hipster, I grew up on punk rock
And I know how to party when I be goin' I don't stop
But tonight, girl I don't want no one else
I want you all to myself
So if you with it let's get it
We could be gone in a minute
Then light it up and we split it, aye
This gon' be a night that you won't be forgettin'
If you get caught we'll tell your dad
You needed help with house sittin' aye

I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(i got no plans if you don't, babe

And i know you wanna stay long

I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song
Sing along to that one song (oh yeah)

Sing along like:
Everybody's got that one song (one song)
Let me sing it to you all night long (night long)
We be makin' love with the lights on (lights on)
It don't matter baby if it's right wrong (right wrong yeah)
So if you leavin' with me
Well then we rollin' in a minute
Baby we gon' see! yeah
Maybe we could kick it
To some dylan or some del rey
Order in some postmates
That's when she say:

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
I type a text, but thеn I never mind that
I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
You might also like
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be 

Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
Cause I love all the little things you do (I mean did)
Cause
I begged you to show up
And; I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up
So I pushed you away
I tell you "you know what"
And; we fought once again
Then we got back together
Who's kidding who, it's a trend
Because
I like being alone 
But i don't like being lonely
I like being home 
But I don't like being homies
You know I'm so sorry
For making you feel like you lost me
We're two unstable enablers
Please try not to be salty
Because
All this time & all these tries
Leave questions open ended
& I would rather die
Than try to live with this resentment
So we could try just one more time
To make sure that we meant it
Or we could cut our losses
Before we blow up & dead it
So
You might also like
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
It's okay to say you're not okay
It's not okay to turn and walk away
We've got problems that we need to face
If you love me, then say it
If you trust me, then show it
If you don't mean it, save it
If you do mean it, own it
You gotta be happy alone
To be happy together
You gotta lose something u know
To learn how to get better
I've been working, you've been hurting
I've been curving, you've been swerving
I've been sleeping, you've been creeping
Now you got me creeped, I'm leaving
I think about you
I dream about you
I smile about you
I cry about you
I lie about you
I'm fine without you
I lied that's not true
I'd die without you
Our love is a war, we use words as our weapons
So either ur real or I'm gone in a second
These thoughts that we have & these feelings we kept in
Make resent & regret, upset & a severance 
You dont fuck with ultimatums 
Have to face it 
Loves contagious 
Also dangerous 
Leaves you damaged
Make it painless 
Now dont make sense
Tried to saved it
Please please please
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's 

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And then you said
This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy
You might also like
So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me, 

I hope you don't dissapoint me with decisions
You know I'll be dissapearing with the quickness
Enticing lightskin pull me in with your pussuasion
I take you home turn off your phone call it vacation
Ensue relations

Am I dead?
Or am I drunk?

I'm tired of:
Fake people, fake smiles, fake hugs
Fake hope, fake friends, fake love
Cuz fake friends are a real waste of time
And fake love is real waste of life
So don’t you go texting me
Telling me
Wish you were next to me
Rest in peace
Everything’s ending eventually
Best friends can become your enemies

Do we have to talk about it?
You know how I make you feel, right?
You know I’d be lost without you
You never felt something so real, right?
Remember when we ran through all the fountains
In downtown that one night?
Now I’m running away
From the one that I thought was the one, right, cuz
You might also like
Feelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you

I’m tired of:
Secrets, lies, excuses
Holding back, the truth is -
I act like I don’t care, but I wish you did
You used to make me smile, now you make me sick
I wish I didn’t waste my time
I wish you didn’t change my mind

Do we have to talk about it?
You know how I make you feel, right?
You know I’d be lost without you
You never felt something so real, right?
Remember when we ran through all the fountains
In downtown that one night?
Now I’m running away
From the one that I thought was the one, right, cuz
Feelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you

(Ahh man)
I hope our feelings don’t fade
I know we know we need space
I’m sorry, I know it’s late
But I’ve got something to say
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
It’s gonna be okay, okay
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow’s just a dream away
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
It’s gonna be okay, okay
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow’s just a dream
