You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh

Since we met, I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away, but I still feel you
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
Late at night, when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you, counting sheep
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm

You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar

You told me, "Boy, look the other way"
You told me, "Boy, hide those hands"
Well, I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And I'm starving now
And that is just the way that we remain
Oh, that will be the way that we remain
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Luck, be on my side tonight
You're the reason that I feel so strong

The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"

Lips, generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes, innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
