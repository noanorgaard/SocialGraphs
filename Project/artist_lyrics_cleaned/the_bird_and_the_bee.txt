And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
They should all just let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
You might also like
And you may not think that I care for you
Well, you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
They should all just let us be
We belong to you and me
