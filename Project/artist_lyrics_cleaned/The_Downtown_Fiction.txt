I wake up, look at the paper
And I can't believe the news
The shops are closed, the roads are covered
And I've got no good excuse
Well, I came unprepared
But I'll prove that I care

And you left me a scar

Well, I made it for you, only took me a few
'Cause I wrote it in my head, I forgot it was Christmas

Forgot everything on your wish list

I forgot it was Christmas
I forgot it was Christmas
Can't believe that it's Christmas
All alone and it's Christmas
I forgot it was

This one is for the girls in the polos
Entrepreneur chicks in the nolos
She could ball with the crew, she could solo
But I think I like her better when she dolo
And I think I like her better with that fitted dress on
She ain't even gotta try to put the mac on
She just gotta give me that look, when she give me that look
