Caught up in that ooh nana, vibin' to my new shit

So let's go half on rent
When I buy you a new purse it's cause you bought my kicks
I move fast like a brand new car

Don't you know that I got that bag
And best believe my mama straight
I sent some bands to Tatiana
And if I brought you out I'll pay your way
I copped a second set of goldens, these ones way more colder
I'm in the sky like all the time and now it's no layover
My records all across the wave and there was no payola
This money new, these hundreds blue, I'm talkin' no Crayola
My credit card is a plastic bankroll
Still keep that knot cause I get guap from paid shows
Got a palace in the cut layin' low
Talkin' to that—
It does whatever I say so

Beat down Accord, cashier up at Five Guys

Night clubs, strip clubs, big bucks, yes sir that's right

A rich man told me it's a part of the come up
Remember when they used to want me to shut up
