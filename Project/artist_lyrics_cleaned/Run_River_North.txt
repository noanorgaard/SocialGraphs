Off to the races, but all of these faces
Keep rolling by me now
I don't understand these lines in my hand
All look the same, all look the same

I think I've changed my mind about a million times
Oh, to run or hide, oh, to run or hide
I'm gonna call this out, I'm coming back somehow
I won't run or hide, I won't run or hide

Lions tearing apart
I see them breaking, breaking
But I can't let them starve
So I let them in
I feel them, feel them tearing up my skin

I think I've changed my mind about a million times
Oh, to run or hide, oh, to run or hide
I'm gonna call this out, I'm coming back somehow
I won't run or hide, I won't run or hide
Run or hide
Run or hide
Run or hide

The lions that you hear
You only give what you get
You're trying to keep this in
Spit it out, spit it out
The lions that you hear
You only give what you get
You're trying to keep this in
Spit it out, spit it out

I think I've changed my mind about a million times
To run or hide, to run or hide
I'm gonna call this out, I'm coming back somehow
I won't run or hide, I won't run or hide

I think I've changed my mind about a million times
Oh, to run or hide, oh, to run or hide
I'm gonna call this out, I'm coming back somehow
I won't run or hide, I won't run or hide
Run or hide
Run or hide
Run or
