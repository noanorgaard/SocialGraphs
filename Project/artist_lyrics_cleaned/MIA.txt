Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screamin' if I blow you with a bang

Suki suki
I'm coming in the Cherokee gasoline
There's steam on the window screen
Take it, take it
Wheel's bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm goin', gonna have you tremblin'

Going nought to bitch, I'll see four million
Accelerating fast, I can do this in a second
Lookin' in the rear view, swaggin' goin' swell
Leavin' boys behind ‘cause it’s illegal just to kill
Shift gear, automatic, damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me when I'm coming through?
What we got left is just me and you
But if I go to bed, baby, can I take you?
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
