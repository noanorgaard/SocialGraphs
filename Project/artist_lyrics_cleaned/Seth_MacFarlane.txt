I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window, at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
God, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe, just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I got to get home
But baby, you'd freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But, don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Ah, but it's cold
Baby, it's cold
