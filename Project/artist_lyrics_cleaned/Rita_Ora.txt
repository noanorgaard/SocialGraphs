Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, “Love, baby, let’s go back to my flat”
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I’m

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think I’m all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)

And now we’re way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, “Love, this is what it's all about”
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song’s got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
