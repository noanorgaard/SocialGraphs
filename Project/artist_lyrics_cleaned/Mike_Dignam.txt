How am I supposed to breathe when you don't care
If I am alive
Or I just drop dead?
How am I supposed to lie in this cold bed
When you've gone and left me powerless?

Hurt
Hurt
Hurt
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hurt
Hurt
Hurt
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh
You might also like
I'd write your name on my skin
Tattooed to let you sink in
Where you last touched me
I'd give you more than a ring
I'd give you every single thing I have

How am I supposed to breathe when you don't care
If I am alive
Or I just drop dead?
Oh, well I come close
To running away
But I stick by you like no one else
So why are you doing this now?

Ohh-oh-oh

I loved you
I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know (I loved you)
I loved you more than you know, know, know
I loved you
I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know (I loved you)
I loved you more than you know, know, know
I'm just

I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know, know, know
I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know
I loved you more than you know, know,
