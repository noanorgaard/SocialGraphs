This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I, like it

I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction

I, I, I, like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

1 ContributorLustful Lenox Encounter (An Erotic Story Inspired by Kapri Styles) LyricsI cranked the ignition, the hum of the engine a stark contrast to the silence between us. JuJu sat shotgun, her body curled inward like she was holding herself together. The Fairfield Inn & Suites faded in the rearview, but my mind wasn’t on the road to Dudley Funeral Home. It was on the dread coiling tight in my gut. I ain't never been good with death, and being at a funeral home ranked low on my list of wants. But for now, I had to face down my own demons.
My voice cut through the quiet to ask JuJu if she was okay, sounding more strained than I intended.
She just nodded, staring out the window. Her grief was this living thing, taking up space in the ride. I reached over, my hand finding her knee, giving it a squeeze. She looked at me then, her eyes wells of pain, and I felt that shit deep. "We almost there," I murmured, trying to smooth out the tension in my voice.
The windows showed Dublin passing by in a blur, buildings and trees nothing more than background noise to the heavy air between us. I kept my grip steady on the wheel, each turn bringing us closer to the place where her grandmother lay still and cold.
We pulled up to Dudley Funeral Home, the building looming like a final judgment. I killed the engine, the silence louder now. We got out, and I could feel JuJu trembling as we stepped inside. The air was thick, perfumed with lilies and something metallic I couldn't name. My throat tightened, but I swallowed it down hard.
JuJu's hand clung to mine like a lifeline as we walked to the casket. There she was, Ms. Latha, looking like sleep had claimed her. JuJu's breath hitched, and a sob broke from her. My chest ached, watching her break apart right there.
Inaudible whispers tore from her lips, as she shook with grief.
I wrapped my arms around her shoulders. I stood there, my own heart pounding loud in my ears, being her rock while my insides twisted up. Funeral homes gave me the creeps.
Death had a way of making everything else seem small, insignificant. I'd left her previously, but she'd somehow finessed me in to coming back. And standing there with JuJu, wanting to leave her again for a long laundry list of reasons.. but I knew I had to put aside my feelings for now. This was about her, not me. But damn if it didn't wear on a man, having to stand strong when all I wanted was to escape.
Stepping out of the Dudley Funeral Home, that sorrowful echo still ringing in my ears, I thought some food might do us both some good. I suggested that we hit up the mall here in Dublin to grab a bite to eat. I forced a smile, pushing down that gnawing feeling clawing at my insides.
She snapped at me, her voice sharp like she was cutting through the grief for just a second. She didn't hesitate to let me know that the mall here ain't have nothing but a dusty Subway and a Starbucks. She then demanded that we go to Lenox because she needed something real to eat.
My jaw clenched tight. That familiar irritation bubbled up, and I fought to keep it from spilling over. Every damn time, she had to make everything extra. Couldn't just be simple. Not with JuJu. But today, she'd buried a piece of her heart. So, I dialed down on the frustration, let it simmer low.
"Alright, Lenox it is," I said, my words measured, careful not to add fuel to the fire burning between us.
The drive was a stretch, and every mile felt like a weight added to my shoulders. We rolled onto US-441 BYP, the road stretching out long and tedious ahead. The scenery blurred—a wash of greenery, the occasional gas station, and tired billboards preaching salvation or a hot meal at some diner that looked like it'd seen better days.
I-16 came next, Jim L Gillis Sr. Memorial Highway, its name as long as the road itself. Forty-five minutes felt like an eternity, the hum of the engine a dull soundtrack to my thoughts. I'd thought about playing my “Recession” album by Jeezy cause that was my shit.. especially the song with Boosie and Anthony Hamilton on it.. but I decided against, given the grim circumstances we were in Georgia for. JuJu sat quiet beside me, staring out the window, lost in a world I couldn't reach.
Macon slipped by, and we merged onto northbound I-75. Traffic thinned out, gave way to open road that led straight into the heart of Atlanta. Skyscrapers rose up like giants in the distance, their glass and steel catching the setting sun—fire and ice against the sky.
"Take exit 2, Connector State Rd 141/Lenox Rd NE" the GPS instructed, its robotic monotone a stark contrast to the chaos inside me.
Lenox Pkwy NE came up, and I swung the car into the crowded lot. My hands gripped the wheel a little too tight, skin stretched over knuckles white with the effort of holding back what I really wanted to say.
"Here we are, Lenox Mall," I managed, my tone flat, doing my best to mask the resentment that threatened to crack my cool façade. JuJu's eyes lit up, and for a hot second, I saw that hunger in her—not for food, but for more. Always more. Her greed was astounding.. and I'm pretty sure she’d concoct some kind of plan to try to finesse me into buying her something. While she was busy scheming on a gangster's pockets, I was busy scheming on a way out of it.
The mall's lights flickered on as dusk settled over Atlanta, the city alive with a pulse that matched the throb of my headache. I parked the car, and there it was—the grandeur, the excess, all wrapped up in one big, glittering package.
"Let's get this over with," I thought to myself, my desire turning not to the flavors we'd find inside but to the sweet relief of solitude I knew wouldn't come. Not tonight. This girl was so annoying. I much as I wanted to leave, I couldn't.. the timing was bad.
I left her before in 2017 because I suspected that she was cheating on me with this guy named Christopher. I could never really prove it, but I had a really bad feeling about the whole thing, especially the way she continuously tried to gaslight and guilt trip me away from my suspicions. But eventually, like a dummy, I came back to her after her first cousin, Aletha, died from a botched BBL surgery in May of 2018. I was about to leave her again, but In August of 2018 her mother Linda died. So I had to wait. Linda's death wasn't much of surprise though, she'd smoked crack and shot heroin for years. She'd gotten hooked on coke in the 1980's when she was affiliated with the "Pony Down Crew" and sold kilos of cocaine. I guess she was trying to be on some Antonio Montana Scarface type of shit.. but she had fallen off big time and she was blind in one eye and in a wheelchair by the time of her passing.
I was all set to leave JuJu again, but then in May of 2019, her father Ronnie died. She was a daddy's girl and she took that one really hard. I decided to wait because I didn't want to kick her while she was down. I was set to leave her again in but her father's mother, Ms. Juanita died in December of 2021. And now in 2023, we were down here in Georgia for her other grandma, Latha. Latha had moved back down here after spending the majority of her adult life in Detroit. She'd only been down here for about two years.. it was almost as if she came back down south just to die close to her roots. But all this is another story for another time though.
The thrill of the mall atmosphere buzzed around us, but all I could feel was the drag of my feet and the pull of a relationship I’d been starting to think twice about.
Stepping out the car, the Lenox Square’s pulse hit us full force, pulling us in. JuJu clung to my arm like she owned it, her nails digging in just enough to remind me where I was supposed to be. As we shuffled through the crowd, her grip tight, I couldn't help but feel the years piled up between us—years of bending over backward, jumping through hoops, all for what? What was it for? What the fuck was i doing?
"Mike, keep up," she snapped, pulling me along as if I was lagging on purpose. The truth? I was. Each step felt like a mile, each smile I forced felt like a lie. This life with her—it wasn't mine. It was a script I'd been following without ever seeing my cue to exit stage left.
The hum of conversation, the clinking of forks and knives at Cousins Maine Lobster, gave a rhythm to the circus that was dinner. We sat down, and JuJu ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, smiling that smile that once had me hooked. But that hook was coming loose. I watched her eat, watched her talk without really listening, and all I could think was how I played myself all these years.. I was done playing the part of the man who gave her everything.
"Let's go to Gucci after this, bae.. you need a new look, shawt.." she said, wiping her mouth with the corner of a napkin, her eyes calculating. "Don't worry, I got you." But we both knew the bullshit game she liked to run. It would start with me and end with her walking out draped in new threads and my bankroll bleeding green.
"A’ight Ju," I said, and the way her name felt in my mouth was a warning sign I couldn’t ignore any longer.
Leaving Cousins Maine Lobster behind, we strolled toward Gucci, but my mind was miles away. That's when it happened. A momentary glance, a chance sighting—there she was.. whoever she was.. her dark eyes hitting me like a shot of something strong. They held promises, stories untold, and a heat that made my blood sing. She looked at me, and the world tilted, shifted, showed me colors I'd forgotten existed.
From the moment I saw her, it was like the entire world slowed down. She moved with a strut that had my eyes glued to her, every step accentuating the curves beneath her tight-fitting dress. Dark hair cascaded down her back, shimmering under the mall's bright lights, and man, I couldn't look away even if I wanted to.
"Mike, are you even listening?" JuJu's voice cut through the fog, but it was too late. I was already drowning in the possibility of what those other woman's eyes meant, of what they offered—a way out, a path to something real.
"Sorry, I was just lost in thought," I mumbled, feeling anything but sorry. Because in that split second, locked in on ol' girl gaze, I tasted freedom. And damn, it was soooo fucking sweet.
"Ju, I gotta drain the main vein real quick," I lied smoothly, detaching my hand from JuJu's grasp. She shot me a look that could cut glass but nodded, her eyes already scanning for the next luxury store to raid.
"Meet you at Gucci in ten," I said, her eyes laced with an edge that suggested it better be five.
"Thank the Almighty for a moment of freedom," I thought to myself as she strutted away, all high heels and high maintenance. My heart thumped a wild rhythm, not from the lie, but for the hunt I was about to embark on.
I slipped through the crowd like a shadow, eyes fixed on the sway of the toffee colored woman's hips as she moved ahead unknowingly. Each step was measured, a dance between eagerness and the need to keep it cool. Couldn't have her thinking I was some desperate fool or worse, a creeper. Nah, I was a D-Boy from The D and I played it smooth.. always and forever though..
The perfume counter at Neiman Marcus loomed ahead, its air rich with scents promising fantasies and hidden desires. There she was, laughing with that carefree vibe of hers, a sound that hooked me deeper. Her fingers trailed over the glass display, pausing over a bottle of Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait de parfum.
"Smells like heaven wrapped in sin, don't it?" I said, stepping up beside her with a confidence I wasn't entirely sure I felt.
She turned, those dark eyes lighting up with recognition and something more, something electric. She stated, matter of factly, how well I must know my scents. Her reply, her voice a mix of surprise and intrigue.
"Only the best for the best," I shot back, leaning in closer to catch another whiff of her, the fragrance mingling with her natural essence, a concoction of temptation.
"Bold choice for a bold woman," the sales clerk chimed in, eyeing the subtle dance between us.
"Life's too short for playing it safe," I said, with my gaze never leaving her's. It was a challenge, a dare, and I was here for it.
“I think this scent captures you" I asked, half teasing, half dead serious.
"Maybe," she teased back, her lips curving in a smile that promised trouble of the best kind.
We talked notes and nuances of the fragrance, but it was just words filling space, an excuse to linger in each other's orbit. She introduced to each other, she said her name was “Kapri”. Every glance we shared spoke louder than any poetic description could, a language of raw attraction neither of us could deny.
"Bag it up," I said to the sales clerk, my eyes never leaving Kapri's. The clerk nodded, boxing up the Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 like it was some ancient relic. My heart hammered against my chest, not from dropping $50 short of a stack on a bottle perfume, but from the electricity crackling between me and this beautiful copper colored woman.
Kapri laughed, her voice a melody that danced through the air, as she questioned why I was so eager to splurge on her like this.
"Only the best for a empress," I spit back, smooth as silk but feeling the heat rise in my veins. The scent of the perfume lingered around us, a constant reminder of the lavish indulgence I'd just committed to. It was about more than buying a bottle perfume; it was a statement, a testament to the electric-like pull she had on me. Now I know how Michael Corleone felt in part one of the Godfather when he saw Apollonia in Sicily.
She graciously accepted with a smirk, stepping into my space, telling me that since I blessed her, she was willing to return the favor. She told me that I needed a new look – something that screamed 'boss'.
Her confidence was a bullet train, and I was all aboard. We strolled over to the men's section, her hips swaying, her big booty bouncing, commanding attention with every step. We weaved through aisles, I watched in amazement as her voluptuous body swayed with a rhythm that hypnotized. She sifted through racks with a practiced eye, pulling out pieces that looked tailor-made for my frame.
Her eye for style was on point, picking out an outfit that would make me feel like a million bucks.
Kapri suggested that I try it on. The shirt look like it would hug my frame just right, and the slacks were cut to perfection. But it was more than clothes; it was the way she paid attention to details, how she cared about the fit, the look, the whole damn package.
In the dressing room, I stripped down, the thought of her outside picking out clothes for me sending a thrill straight to my core. I slipped into the outfit, feeling like a damn superhero suiting up for battle. The mirror reflected a man transformed - the shirt hugged my shoulders like a second skin, and the pants, well, they did exactly what they were designed to do.
Kapri called out for me to come out and let her see how I looked, with excitement lacing her words.
I pushed open the door, her approval worth more than any price tag. Her eyes scanned me top to bottom, and I felt like a piece of prime real estate being appraised by the highest bidder.
"Dayuum," she breathed out, circling me like a shark who'd just found her meal. "You killin' it, my nigga.. THIS!" she paused, her fingers brushing lightly over the lapel of my blazer, sending sparks flying through my body, "yeah, this is the one."
The way she looked at me, like I was the last man on earth, sent a clear message - we were vibing on a level deeper than threads and fabric. It was raw, uncut attraction, the kind that made you want to risk it all for a taste of something real. Something like her.
"Guess I owe you one now," I said, the corner of my mouth lifting in a half-smile.
"Maybe you do," Kapri shot back, her grin infectious and promising a world of trouble I was ready to dive headfirst into.
I watched Kapri's hips sway as we made our way into the dressing room, the silence between us thick with anticipation. The heat from Kapri's body was already setting my skin on fire as we slipped into that fancy-ass Neiman Marcus dressing room. Damn, girl was fine - her curves had me hypnotized, her caramel skin glowing under the soft light. My heart was pounding so hard I swear she could hear it.
I felt intoxicated, taking in the sight of her. Kapri's dark eyes flashed with mischief as I locked that door behind us, with trembling fingers. The sound echoed in the small space, sealing us off from the world outside. Now it was just me and her, the air electric between us.
After the door was closed, and I spun her around, pressing her back against it. My breath hot on her neck.
I groaned as she pressed herself against me, her voluptuous figure fitting into my hands like she was made for me. I devoured her neck like Count Dracula with wet kisses that were deep, and hungry, each one stoking a fire that had been ready to ignite from the start. Her skin was smooth, her curves generous and inviting.
Thoughts raced through my mind - how long before someone noticed we was in here? How quiet could we keep it? But then Kapri's hands were on me and everything else faded away.
All I could focus on was the softness of her skin, the fullness of her lips, the intoxicating scent of the perfume she'd just sprayed on. My body was on fire, aching to explore every inch of her.
This was crazy risky, but damn if it didn’t make it even hotter. Here we were, about to get down in a high-end store dressing room. The thrill of it had my dick straining against my pants already.
I pulled Kapri close, as if we were extras in a Carl Thomas music video, savoring the feel of her curves pressed against me. I almost couldn't breathed.
Her soft lips seared mine with a kiss that made my knees weak. Oh yeah, we were both more than ready...
Clothes were shed in a hurry, a tangle of fabric on the floor—the world outside of the fitting room ceased to exist. Only the heat of our bodies, the urgency of our needs mattered. I lifted her onto the small bench, and she wrapped those thick thighs around me, pulling me closer.
She stared at me wantingly.. breathe-moaning, and I obliged without a second thought.
Her nails dug into my back as I thrust into her, each movement punctuated by her soft cries. Kapri's body welcomed me, tight and warm—our rhythm unbridled passion, raw and unapologetic.
Every thrust, every moan, every stolen breath was a testament to the raw connection that neither of us could deny.
I couldn't get enough of saying her name, tasting it on my tongue as I explored every inch of her, driven by a need that felt like it'd been waiting forever to be unleashed.
Right there, in the tight space of that dressing room, with the clamor of the mall just beyond the door, we were finding an escape in each other. There was no past, no future, no JuJu, no drama—just Kapri and me, lost in a world where all that mattered was the pleasure we gave and took in equal measure.
My phone vibrated angrily from the pile of clothes as Young Jeezy began to shout about how he done done it all in my “Air Forces 2” ringtone. JuJu's name flashed on the screen, but I couldn't care less. Not when Kapri was unraveling beneath me, whispering my name like a prayer.
Kapri's voice broke as she begged me to fuck her, waves of pleasure racked her body. I knew she was close, her walls clenching around me, pushing me to the edge.
The chorus of “Air Forces 2” kept playing over and again, stopping then starting again and again as JuJu kept blowing up my phone.
I barely had time to catch my breath before Kapri pushed me hard against the wall, her hands roaming all over my body like she was trying to memorize it. Her lips crashed into mine, hungry and demanding. I felt her tongue slip into my mouth, teasing and exploring.
My hands slid down her back, feeling the smooth curve of her spine. I gripped that perfect ass of hers, lifting her up like she weighed nothing. Kapri's legs wrapped around my waist, pulling me in closer.
I growled against her neck, breathing in her scent. She really knew how to drive a nigga wild.
Kapri let out a low, sultry laugh that sent shivers down my spine.
I could feel the heat radiating off her body, matching the torch burning inside me. My mind was foggy with desire, but a small part of me still worried about getting caught by a store clerk or perhaps JuJu getting wise to where I really was.
"We gotta keep it quiet," I whispered, even as my hips pressed against hers instinctively.
"Then you better find a way to keep my mouth busy my nigga," Kapri said teasing, her breath hot against my ear.
I groaned, struggling to keep my composure. This woman was gonna be the death of me, but shiiiiit.. this would a hell of a way to go.
My fingers trailed along Kapri's body, savoring every curve and dip. I found the straps of her dress, slowly pulling it down, the soft sound echoing in the small space. The fabric fell away, pooling at her feet like water.
"Gotdamn," I breathed, taking in her naked form. Her toffee skin glowed in the dim light, curves begging to be touched. My eyes roamed over her body, drinking in every detail.
Kapri's smile was wicked as she pressed against me. Her fingers danced along my waistband, teasing, exploring. She tugged at my belt playfully, her touch sending sparks through my body.
I definitely liked what I saw and heard as she kissed and purred, her lips brushing my ear.. but I really wanted to taste her sweet candy. She reminded me of gooey thick caramel that oozed out of a Cadbury Caramello Milk Chocolate Caramel Candy bar. And like Caramello bars, she too was for a gentlemen or a gangster who enjoyed the finer things, light chocolate and extra sugary sweet caramel that required less effort to eat.
I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry as Kapri's hand dipped lower, palming me through my jeans. She whispered in my ear about how she could feel how bad I wanted it, her voice dripping with heat.
My hands itched to touch her, to explore every inch of her body. But I held back, letting her set the pace. The anticipation and wanting was killing me, like a junkie picking up a piece of white lint off the carpet of a trap house, but damn if it wasn’t sweet torture.
"Tell me what you want," I growled, my voice rough with need.
Kapri's laugh was low and sultry as she told me that she wanted me to make her forget her own name, she breathed it out, her words sending a shiver down my spine.
I couldn’t take it no more. I scooped Kapri up in my arms, her body warm and soft against mine. She weighed next to nothing as I carried her to the plush velvet bench in the corner.
As her fingers traced my biceps, I set her down gentle-like, taking in the sight of her sprawled out on that rich fabric. Damn if she wasn’t the finest thing I'd ever seen. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might bust out of my chest.
"She's beautiful," I thought to myself, my mind clouded with emotion.
Kapri didn’t have any panties on and her eyes sparkled as she spread her legs, inviting me in. My fingers found their way between her thighs, feeling the slick heat there. So wet already, just for me. I stroked her clit slow and steady, watching her face as pleasure washed over her.
Kapri's back arched, a low moan escaping her lips as she breathed heavily.
I leaned in close, breathing in her scent while increasing the pressure.
She voiced out a breathy "Yeeeesss" that sent shivers down my spine. I was hard as a rock, straining against my jeans, but right now was all about her pleasure. I'd make her go crazy if it was the last thing I did.
I took a quick moment to let my tongue and middle finger rest from the taste and feel of her when suddenly Kapri's hands were at my waist, yanking down my pants. My dick sprang free, rock hard and aching for her touch. She licked her lips and before I could respond, she took me in her mouth.
The wet heat enveloped me and I had to bite back a groan. Didn’t want the whole damn store hearing us.
Kapri worked me with skill, her tongue swirling around the head of my dick before taking me deep to the back of her throat. The sight of her luscious lips wrapped around me nearly made me lose it right there.
"Fuuuuck," I whispered, my fingers tangling in her hair. That mouth of hers was magic.
She softly moan-hummed in response, the vibrations sending sparks of pleasure through my body. I was getting close, too close. I didn't want to blow my whole load in her mouth before finding out what her pussy felt like.
Reluctantly, I managed to yank my dick out of her mouth.. Kapri released me with a pop, a wicked gleam in her eye.
Clothes were shed in a hurry, a tangle of fabric on the floor—the world outside of the fitting room ceased to exist. Only the heat of our bodies, the urgency of our needs mattered. I lifted her onto the small bench, and she wrapped those thick thighs around me, pulling me closer.
She stared at me wantingly.. breathe-moaning, and I obliged without a second thought.
I sat down on that fancy bench and pulled her onto my lap. Positioning myself between those big juicy thighs, I eased into her slowly as she sat down onto my lap, savoring every inch.
Her nails dug into my back as I thrust into her, each movement punctuated by her soft cries. Kapri's body welcomed me, tight and warm—our rhythm unbridled passion, raw and unapologetic.
Every thrust, every moan, every stolen breath was a testament to the raw connection that neither of us could deny.
I couldn't get enough of saying her name, tasting it on my tongue as I explored every inch of her, driven by a need that felt like it'd been waiting forever to be unleashed.
Right there, in the tight space of that dressing room, with the clamor of the mall just beyond the door, we were finding an escape in each other. There was no past, no future, no JuJu, no drama—just Kapri and me, lost in a world where all that mattered was the pleasure we gave and took in equal measure.
The tightness and warmth of her pussy had me seeing stars. I had to take a deep breath to keep from busting right then and there.
"Goddamn," I breathed, lost in the feel of her. She rolled her hips, taking me deeper. She felt so good.
I gripped Kapri's waist as she started to ride me, her body moving with a rhythm that had my head spinning. Every roll of her hips sent shockwaves of pleasure through me. I couldn’t take my eyes off her - the way her titties bounced, the curve of her neck as she threw her head back. As she started going faster, she breathed heavily and her nails digging into my shoulders.
I slid my hands down to cup that fat ass of hers, helping her bounce on my dick. The sound of skin on skin filled the small space, mixing with our heavy breathing.
As I lifted her, I caught sight of a tattoo just below her right shoulder - a big red flower, its petals spread wide. Damn if it wasn’t the sexiest thing I'd ever seen.
I crushed my lips into hers, our tongues tangling as we kissed deep and dirty. The intimacy of it, face to face like this, had my heart racing even more than my body.
My phone vibrated angrily from the pile of clothes as Young Jeezy began to shout about how he done done it all in my “Air Forces 2” ringtone. JuJu's name flashed on the screen, but I couldn't care less. Not when Kapri was unraveling beneath me, whispering my name like a prayer.
Kapri's voice broke as she begged me to fuck her, waves of pleasure racked her body. I knew she was close, her walls clenching around me, pushing me to the edge.
The chorus of “Air Forces 2” kept playing over and again, stopping then starting again and again as JuJu kept blowing up my phone.
A noise outside the dressing room had us both freezing. Footsteps, getting closer. The fear of getting caught sent a thrill through me, making my dick throb inside her.
"Shhh," I whispered against her lips, fighting the urge to moan as she clenched around me.
We held still, barely breathing, as I responded in reassurance to an employee's voice that called out, asking if everything was alright in here. Though it was a struggle I managed to give a believable reply about "Just... trying on some clothes”, with my voice only shaking a little bit.
The footsteps faded away and we both let out a breath. Kapri's eyes met mine, sparkling with a brief flash of relief and then a sudden devilish mischief. Wheew.. that was close… she continued grind on me hard.
After we were sure that the employee was no longer in earshot, I gritted my teeth, struggling to keep quiet as Kapri's tight pussy pulsed around me. She buried her face in my neck, her hot breath tickling my skin.
I bit back a groan, my hands tightening on her hips.
She just grinned, lifting herself up. It was time for us to change positions. Hopefully, we could keep the noise to a minimum.
Without waiting for an answer, she climbed off me. I mourned the loss of her warmth for only a second before she was pushing me down onto my back on the carpeted floor.
Kapri straddled me again, this time facing away. The sight of her big juicy round ass hovering over my dick had me throbbing. That's when I noticed something new - a Chinese character tattooed on each of her buttcheeks.
I opened my mouth to ask what they meant, but Kapri chose that moment to sink down on me.. and it was on, like Rae Dawn Chong. All thoughts flew outta my head as her wet heat enveloped me again.
"Fuuuuuck," I hissed, my hands flying to her hips as she started to ride me.
She leaned back, pressing her back against my chest. The new angle had me hitting spots that made her whole body shudder.
My cell phone kept going off.. JuJu kept calling and Jeezy must’ve shouted about how he’d “done it all” at least fifteen times..  a distant annoyance drowned out by the sound of flesh slapping against flesh and Kapri's gasps for more. It was a symphony of lust, each note a promise of ecstasy.
I couldn’t help myself - I reached around, my right hand finding her clit while the other played with her left nipples. Kapri's breath hitched, her movements becoming more frantic.
I felt her walls clenching around me, and suddenly she was cumming hard, a gush of wetness flooding over my dick and onto my thighs.
As the waves of her orgasm passed, Kapri collapsed back against me, breathless. Then, out of  nowhere, she started giggling.
The joy of the moment wasn't lost on me either. I couldn’t help it - I burst out laughing, the vibrations making Kapri moan and squirm on top of me. The mix of pleasure and laughter had me feeling high in a way I'd never experienced before.
I gently lifted Kapri off me, my dick slipping out with a wet sound that echoed in the small space. The dressing room suddenly felt too cramped, too hot. I needed to feel her, all of her.
"Get up," I growled, my voice low and rough with desire.
Kapri's eyes flashed with excitement as she stood, her body glistening with sweat. I spun her around, bending her over the plush velvet bench. My hands gripped her hips tight, fingertips digging into her soft skin as I lined myself up.
She was definitely ready for more and I teased her pussy lips with the tip of my dick.
She started pushing back against me.
I slid in slow, savoring every inch as her pussy stretched to take me. Once I was buried to the hilt, I paused, admiring the view. The tattoos on her ass caught my eye again.. Chinese letters I couldn’t read but found sexy as her voluptuous ass jiggled with each stroke.
Then Kapri clenched around me, and all thoughts fled my mind like a Shaolin monks deep in meditation. I started moving, pounding into her from behind. The wet sounds of our bodies slapping together filled the room, mingling with our suppressed cries of joy.
Her walls were so tight, so wet, I felt like I might lose my mind. Every thrust sent shockwaves of pleasure through me, building to a crescendo I wasn’t sure I could contain. I bit my lip hard, fighting the urge to scream her name like that K. Michelle song.
With her voice barely above a whisper, Kapri demanded that I go harder and make her feel it.
I gave her what she wanted, my hips snapping faster, harder in a circular motion. The bench creaked beneath us, and for a wild moment I wondered if we might break it. But I was too far gone to care. Kapri had that “Sunshine” pussy from “Harlem Nights”.. the kind of pussy make you call your wife and tell her to have a nice life. Hell, Kapri even looked a little bit like Lela Rochon use to look back in the 1990’s.
I was lost in the rhythm, the heat, the silky grip of her body. But something about them tattoos kept catching my eye.
"Yo, what them Chinese characters mean?" I panted, slapping her ass lightly.
Kapri glanced back, a sly grin on her face and told me that the left cheek was 'Prosperity', as she let out a soft moan before finishing her sentence, telling me that the right cheek was 'Delightful'."
We both cracked up, the laughter mingling with our gasps of pleasure. I growled, gripping her hips tighter as I delightfully prospered inside of her.. over and over and over again.
She tried to say something else but stop and gritted her teeth as she shuddered, the intensity of another orgasm ripping through her. Her satisfaction was my victory.
Suddenly, Kapri pushed back against me, stopping my motion. Her eyes were wild with desire urgency as she told me to put my dick in her ass.
My dick twitched at her words. She nodded, desperation in her eyes. In a breathy, almost Marilyn Monroe petition, she said "Please."
I lined myself up, pushing in slow. Fuck, she was so tight. So tight I thought I might lose it right then.
I hissed, fighting for control. But it was a losing battle.
I'd only been in her back door for about a minute and a half, but before I knew it, I blew my whole load and was cumming harder than I ever came in my life. My whole body shook with the unbelievable force of it, pleasure so intense it was almost pain. My orgasm was so powerful that I had to fight the urge to cry out in my moment of joy. I bit down on my fist to keep from shouting.
When I finally came down, I realized I'd filled her up completely. I’d  never produced this much semen during a climax before either. My cum splashed the inside of Kapri's anal walls until it overflows and drips out of her. As I pulled out, more cum escapes from my dick spilled between her cheeks
Kapri giggled and said that I'd given her a “buns and jelly sandwich,” as she twerked her ass and makes her cheeks clap together with my dick dangling between the inner parts of her butt cheeks. The sexual joy is unbelievable.
Kapri moan softly as I  put my dick back into her butthole but I didn’t fuck her anymore. We just enjoy the intimate feeling of our flesh together, our bodies trembling with ecstasy, our connection deepened by our shared desire.
I kept my dick in her ass for another five minutes before I got myself together. We got up and stumbled to the bench in the fitting room… my legs could barely hold me up. Kapri's lipstick smeared on my shirt collar, her scent clinging to me like a second skin. I scooped up my phone from the pile of discarded clothes and the screen lit up again with JuJu's name—a barrage of texts and missed calls.
I read the text messages. First there was “Nigga, how long do it take to pee?” Then there was “You ignoring me?” Then the every famous one word text that she liked to send with a simple “Hello”, as if demanding an answer. Then there was “I’m at the Gucci store where you at?” Then "nigga, you better have a damn good reason for ignoring me!" Then finally "IM OUTSIDE THE GUCCI STORE. WHERE ARE YOU?!" Her texts screamed in all caps, entitlement pouring out her digital words. The only thing missing was the I'm Hungary” text. Her dumb ass would spell it “H-U-N-G-A-R-Y” like country in Europe.
Ordinarily, I would've been so very annoyed, but I just got me some pussy for the first time in three months.. so I was on chill. I called my voicemail and punched in my four digit code to check my voice messages. JuJu's voice was shrill, piercing through the speaker as I checked the voicemail. Each word was a slap to my conscience, but I felt numb, detached.
I shook my head, the weight of years bearing down on me. I couldn't do it anymore—I just couldn't be the sucker ass nigga she wanted me to be, shackled to her whims.
My thumb hovering over the call button. It felt like jumping off a cliff, but the ground below was freedom.
"JuJu, we're done," I said when she picked up, in a tone eerie similar to the Richie character in the “Harlem Nights” film. My voice steady for the first time in what felt like forever. "Ain't no going back. You'll find your way, but it's  gon' be without me."
Her response was about to be a cacophony of rage and disbelief, but I hung up on her before she could get the words out. She called back, I answered the phone and hung up again. This happened about ten more times before I gave up and just blocked her.. severing the last thread between us. She couldn't leave me a voicemail anyway because my voicemail box was full from all the other messages she'd previously left. The relief that washed over me was like that first breath after being underwater too long. I was free.
Kapri, who'd say beside me during the whole episode, searched my eyes for signs of regret.. but there was none.
"I'm good," I replied, reading her mind. Kapri knew her power, and she wielded it without apology—street-smart and book-smart rolled into one irresistible package. My arm found it's way around her waist. I kissed her softly and said "Let's bounce before someone peeps this."
Now back in the store, I quickly paid for the outfit Kapri picked out for me and then we stepped out into the hustle of Lenox Mall, my mind racing with what just went down. Breaking up with JuJu had been necessary—an unshackling. Yet here I was, stepping into something unknown with Kapri. Something risky, something real.
Nothing worth having is ever easy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that with Kapri, every step felt like a new beat in a song I'd been waiting to hear my whole life.
I pulled Kapri closer to me, a promise in her eyes that spoke of complications I didn't care to unpack—not yet.
She began to speak, her voice was silk, smooth and teasing, as she glanced over her shoulder, catching me staring. Her dark eyes sparkling with a challenge. Those luscious lips curled into a smile that could've melted steel. Kapri wasn't just beautiful; she was electric, exuding a confidence that drew me in deeper.
Everything that I was experiencing with her was a vibe. I was truly caught up in the moment, in her presence. I held her tightly, closing the gap between us. The scent of her perfume was intoxicating, a mix of bold and sweet—just like her.
As we left Lenox behind, the city lights of Atlanta blurring past us, I knew one thing for sure—I was ready for whatever came 

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end 

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too 

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on 

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around

You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, 

I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

Hmm, hmm
