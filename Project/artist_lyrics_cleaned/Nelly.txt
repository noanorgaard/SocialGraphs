Takin' more total request than your MTV
Errry, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie wanna signin' bonus for that punana
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find anotha'
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me

Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (How does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. to 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun
What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son
I went from slangin' and bangin' to yellin number one
I love my fans to death, until my last breath
That's why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same
Do they want the fame, and all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin collars from California to D.C
I'm in the VIP, Louis bottles and Hennessey
I'm putting mileage on 20 inches and 23's
I'm flippin out my keys, I'm flippin down the screens

But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, "NE" behind the "O"

O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin' in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Rock em once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force 
1 ContributorThe Mission Back to the Terminal (Album Explanation/Thank Yous) LyricsJudge me as you shall, but understand the expression through experience not just words. The Mission Back to the Terminal is an album based on the true expression of the source we all are as deliberate creators and sifters of life. The journey begins with I in place of the Jet headed back to the terminal, which symbolizes me attempting to find myself. The album opens up with "The Mission," through all of the doubts I experienced from either others or myself; I am questioning and expressing the questions posed from what I have experienced in life. As the tracks progress down the album, the journey continues to reveal the jet headed on its way to the terminal flying over different cities and sights, each city and sight being a different life experience to learn and grow from. The first half of the album, I feel to be the outcast of those that surround me causing me to feel rebellious towards the norm of things in my experience. "It's my world inside the body that I'm living in." - Shoemaker
Nearing the second half of the album, by "Find a Way," I find interest in a high school friend and receive my first glimpse of affection towards her. This clearly foreshadows an event between the two of us when the mission is to be completed during the album. I leave very vague clues throughout the album. "Earth Girl" is an interlude track that can be considered a layover for the flight during the journey back to the Terminal. "The pursuit of passion" is the chase, which is open to any interpretation, believing any external object or person and my case the girl can be the source of happiness and which is where I am attempting to impress and also express myself to her during this place in the album. During the journey of finding myself at the Terminal, I realize that true place and joy comes from loving yourself. 
Thank you.
I would like to thank God for giving me the courage and words to express my appreciation for every moment that unfolds allowing me to grow as an individual being. My parents both instilled wonderful values in me that I carry till this very day! I humbly say that they both are the reason that I am very meek, outspoken yet kind-hearted. Thank you to my extended family in both Ghana and Nigeria! I love you all, and this experience is definitely one we will all benefit from. Thank you Mya Bledsoe (we'll just say Ihejeto)/TaMya Raine for having faith in me from the moment we met and continually showering me with your love even when I feel unworthy of it. I am very blessed to be experiencing this journey with you by my side, I love you more than words and time can express! Thank you for being the girl of my dreams! You're truly my backbone. Thank you to Jhené Aiko for being the connecting link between Mya and I. Thank you for retweeting "High School Sweetheart" because of your sample in the song. Thank you to D'Angela Kelly for being a source of motivation with the music, motivating and leading me to one of my prominent sources of drive, motivation, and a guide to lead me to a person that has become my backbone, love and support. Thank you to Aunye Scott Anderson for listening to the album before the release and all of those people that decided to assist me in getting Jhené Aiko's attention with "High School Sweetheart." You changed my life for the better! Thank you LuMo for starting this musical journey with me and being my "40." I remember being in the apartment right on 5th Street, two blocks away from San José State University when we applied for the dorms too late and had to find a place to live a week before school started. Everything worked out as fate and faith would have it and we discovered we both had a passion for music! Back then, I would record songs to Ruqaiyah Muhammad that I'd never release. You gave our group the name "Wrekless" and since then, it's really taken off! Thank you to the whole class of 2008 at Dorsey High School, DDP, those that were in the ninth through eleventh grade when I was a senior as well especially the football team and coaches. You gave me a foundation and taught me how to persevere and be passionate about everything I believed in! Thank you to DJ Mustard, Rahim Moore, Jeremy Harris, and Johnathan Franklin, Johnathan Kelly, Joshua "Jboy" Ottemewo, Justin Webster, Vaness Harris, Michelle Harris, and Dale Alexander for showing me that dreams do come true and achieving your dreams. Thank you to Johnathan Kelly for listening to this album in its entirety and offering suggestions on "Break Away" that really brought out its potential! Thank you to Ms. Estes for inspiring us as students! Thank you to Ms. Kinney, Mr. Speakes, Coach Dave! "You're gonna be something one day; not today though!!!!" - Coach Dave. You always made us all laugh and I am glad to see that your daughters are doing wonderful now that they're at Dorsey! Thank you to Coach Beno Bryant for having faith in me since I was a young quarterback attempting to prove myself and be a part of the football team. I appreciate coach Don, Coach James for your support on the track during practice and words of wisdom during track meets. Thank you to Coach Tilly for giving me the moniker "Jet 2." Thank you to Max "Willie" Williams and Marcus "Spiyda" Jackson & Nashawn Jackson! It's great to see little Drew Jackson grow up so fast! Thank you to Victoria Blanco for your support and joy! I truly appreciate every word of encouragement. Thank you to Nate Tavasti for praying over me and giving me my first glimpse of the holy spirit! I truly appreciate you for drawing me nearer to God.

Thank you to Noa James, Curtiss King, Phantom Thrett and all of the wonderful artists out of the Inland Empire and especially the Common Ground for being a beautiful platform for me to express and perform my music!

Thank you to Kendrick Lamar for writing my e-mail on a dollar bill and making me feel as though the dream was coming closer in that moment. Thank you to all of the dope rhyme spitters that allow me the canvas to be able to focus on my lyrics and get to what truly excites all of us "hip-hop heads!" Thank you to Garrett "V.C." Veasey for being my Diddy and always letting me know when it didn't sound right and giving me pointers on things I could do to make it perfect! We were always the best dancers at any party we went to at San José State! Thank you BeeGee for bringing the rest of the crew members together in the perfect ways you did. You're a wonderful solid person and I truly appreciate your enthusiasm about the vision. Thank you to Roy "Charlie Brown" RockstarTuNE Sanders!!!! Words can't even explain how appreciative I am of you for everything you've done! Truly being a pioneer and entrepreneur with Project Dark Saga, allowing me to borrow your Macbook to finish the album when mines was down, purchasing the midi and truly pushing the creativity through our talks about our observations on the life around us. "Yeah, our heart's clean you can let God tell you that!" Thank you to Tajmeer "Hitman" Jones for being my ace. We kill everything musically and yes; the Staples Center is ours! Thank you Josh "Jboy" Sanders for always coming through in the clutch moments! I hope you're enjoying yourself out in Nevada!!! Thank you to Jamal Cristopher and his twin Justin Wilson for being blessing amazing! If it wasn't for you two and of course Len Springs, The Mission Back to the Terminal would sound no where near as good as it does! Len, you always made me re-do verses and songs and add some and take some off and you let me know if it was weak! I love that now that it's done, but I hated it during the time! haha I appreciate you so much! Jamal Cristopher, I appreciate you for dreaming with me continually and allowing me to be your engineer and inspiration! You inspire me to keep reaching new heights. Thank you to Rodvé "Vé317" Lewis!!! Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up!!!! We are the Black Romans and they need to know that hahaha! I appreciate you for coming through to freestyle with me for at least three hours every time and doing overtime afterwards with the flows!

Who am I you ask me, you know it's 'bout that grammar
From any state, it don't matter, from Maine to Montana

"Can I take a hit", "Here, boo, like this"
Chronic's sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes
Don't worry 'bout my funds, I play around it in one
When you've seen that Hummer but that was last summer
This year I'm more blunter, more up close and personal
It's just gon' get worse now, from Prada to Vokal
The ‘Tics are too versatile, can't worry 'bout certain sounds
That come out these haters' mouths, I realize they can't help it
Just stay where you're bowing down some more
You can't get these pounds, unless you gon' smoke it now
If not, I suggest you pack your shit up and head out of town

I got that good at e'ry gas station, pull on up

We got straws for the bottles, outlaw the cups
And we gon' make it happen, ain't no need for no luck
Ain't no lotteries, no pick 3's or pick 2's
Keep the money in your family, gamble amongst your crew
Cause the dice gon' do what the dice gon' do
And if you take a life, you gon' lose yours too
Ain't no trials, it's automatic, you drop 'em right where it happen
You do unto others if you don't want it don't do the cappin
Think that's cool? 40 acres and a mule
Fuck that! Nellyville - 40 acres and a pool
Six bedrooms, full bath with a jacuzz'
Six-car garage, pavement smooth
Both front and back deck 'nough room to land a jet

You better watch who you talkin' bout
Runnin' your mouth – like you know me
You gon' fuck around and show why the "Show Me" get called the "Show Me"
Why one-on-one you can't hold me, if your last name was Haynes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats – total? Naw, that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this – my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola – no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin', it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside, takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please, boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin', and cryin' – suck it up as a loss
'Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh, eh a-hold that

I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
I... am... number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey – now let me ask you, man
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers (Hey)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey...
See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around? (Whoo!)
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?
Hell yeah, ma – I love a girl that's willin' to learn
Willin' to get in the driver's seat and willin' to turn
And not concerned about that "he say," "she say," "did he say
What I think he said?" Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, internet access, some... website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Ohh, if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin' my style, right to the "down down"
Can't leave out the store now, better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin', "Yo, where the party?"
Ohh lordy – will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin' fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words, but there's one thing I know – Pimp

I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
Hey – I... am... number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey – tell me now, dirty
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers (Tell me)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Check it, uhh, check, yo
Aiyyo, I'm tired of people judgin' what's "real Hip-Hop"
Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin' album flop
YOU KNOW! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'MON! Mad 'cause I'm hot; HE JUST – mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin' in flocks
'Til you top the Super Bowl, keep your mouth on lock
Shhhhh... {*crickets*} I'm awake, ha ha ha!
I'm cocky on the mic, but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin' for granted, blessin' e'rrything, on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby, name not Sigel but I speak "The Truth"
I heat the booth – Nelly actin' so uncouth
Top down, shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again, if it means I'ma win

Hey –
Dirty, I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
I... I... I am... number one
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers
Number 1
'Cause 2 is not a winner and 3 nobody
