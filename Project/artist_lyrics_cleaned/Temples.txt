Sleep away your life, shine fear into her
Save your face and keep your hands firmly pressed into the earth
I feel relief when night time eventually comes
Talk of all the dreams, you surely have one
Mind your head and keep your hands firmly pressed into the earth

A shameful display, it's all in bourbon and lace
To keep in the dark
Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A colourless string to a colourful bow
That sings in the night, and never grows old

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A shameful display, it's all in bourbon and lace
To keep in the dark
Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling, dressed in white
A colourless string to a colourful bow
That sings in the night, and never grows
