Babe, we both had dry spells, hard times
In bad lands, I’m a good man for you
I’m a good man

Last night there was a horse in the road
I was twisting in the hairpin
My hands held on, my mind let go
And back to you my heart went skipping
I found the inside of the road
Thought about the first time that I met you
All those glances that we stole
Sometimes if you want them, then you’ve got to

They shot a Western south of here
They had him cornered in a canyon
And even his horse had disappeared
They said it got run down by a bad, bad man
You’re not a good shot, but I’m worse
And there’s so much where we ain’t been yet

Hear my confession, then I'll go
I'd rather be the one who loves
Than to be loved and never even know
Hello, brown one
Hello, blue one
Last night's feathers
Exchanged for new ones

Long time coming, but now
The snow is gone
