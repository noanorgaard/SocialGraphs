Extreme diligence, team killing, we never let up
Burn it into your brain, so that you will never forget us
That's a molten core memory like Torbjorn when he's ulted up
Spraying lava on the floor of sworn enemiеs
Bring Baptiste first, hit you with that three burst
You rage quit, or get kickеd, either way you'll meet defeat first
Don't try it, you don't wanna fight the likes of us
Popping off and dropping all these omnics, watch me light them up
Your team - we do not fear it
Kiriko throwing out kunais and ofudas with the power of the fox spirit
Cowards getting dropped quick as Reinhardt with a hammer down
Landing on the ground stunned, don't just stand around - run!
Pharah's missiles firing on you foes
Junkrat is rolling tires that'll find you, expiring your souls
When the smoke clears nothing left, no body to behold
Just a flaming crater, call that a fire in the hole! Hater

You can't match this, we'll be on the top (get with us)
Different tactics, yeah, we got a lot (switch it up)
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over! Watch!
Switch it up, switch it up!
Switch it up, don't stop!
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over! Watch!

Let's go, you oughta know by now that we will never be scared to switch it up
If you're getting shot by a cupid Hanzo, it's not a kiss, good luck
And we put a heart on the back of the arrows, but that don't mean this is love
Shooting you into your back across the map, that's long distance love
My team is colder than a penguin chilling in a blizzard beside a fisher hole
Colder than Mei pulling out the blaster, got the enemy feeling froze
Colder than the antarctic, gotta be one hundred ten below
I'm just saying my team is too cold for you, ain't no way that you winning, bro
Face getting rearranged if we throw them thangs, I ain't talking guns
But I'm talking Doomfist - right arm is like a boomstick, kill 'em with a punch
Only needing one hit and then you're gone, there's a reason that we come in number one
The cavalry is here! You should never fear, we gon' get it done, got 'em on the run
The opposition's bending over backwards until the point that they are doing backflips
They can not catch it, because we're coming up with different tactics
Look at Genji pulling out the dragon, Ana's on the roof and aiming at ya
Round's over, your whole team will be defeated before you even know what happened
You can't match this, we'll be on the top (get with us)
Different tactics, yeah, we got a lot (switch it up)
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over! Watch!
Switch it up, switch it up!
Switch it up, don't stop!
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over! Watch!

Switch it up, yeah, switch it up
We coming at you from below and from above
You think you're ready, but it'll never be enough
'Cause once we coming, we ain't ever letting up
Over and over, just begun
I been feeling I'm the one
No, we ain't ever letting up
No, we ain't ever letting up

You can't match this, we'll be on the top (get with us)
Different tactics, yeah, we got a lot (switch it up)
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over! Watch!
Switch it up, switch it up!
Switch it up, don't stop!
You know the squad, we're going hard
And if we switch it up, then it's Over!
