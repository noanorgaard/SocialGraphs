Bitch, you guessed it
Walkin' around with extra in my pockets
Bitch, you next to us, why the fuck are you next to us?
Bitch, you should come test us
I seen what you rockin' and, bitch, you can't dress with us
Seen what yo' bitch looked like
And, nigga, I wasn't impressed or nothin'
Fuck-nigga, come and talk it out
Fuck-nigga, we ain't talkin' it out
What the fuck we finna talk about?
All we know is that Mula, Benjis, Franklins
And that Guala, Fetti with us
Bunch of young niggas
Bunch of them bitches, all in they whip
Lickin' on tit
Runnin' my check up, I think I'm with Nike, I'm sprintin'
Sheesh, y'all couldn't hear me?
Bitch, you guessed it
You was motherfuckin' right
You might also like
Bitch, you guessed it, hoo
You was right
Bitch, you guessed it
Grrah, grrah, fuck-nigga on sight
Bitch, you guessed it
Still in that place and I'm flexin', hoo
Bitch, you guessed it
I'm still with my niggas, come and test us
O.G.G.​
Bitch, you—
Damn,
