How it feels when I hold you close
So tell me what you like
'Cause I'm runnin' out of time
Promise you I'm not insane
Somethin' 'bout you that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

Yeah, all I wanna do is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

Staring at your picture
It's hanging on my wall
Yeah, I even called your mama
To ask her how to get through to your heart
And I said-
