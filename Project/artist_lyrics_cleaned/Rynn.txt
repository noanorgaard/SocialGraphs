I don't mean to be a bother but I was pondering if you'd cross an ocean for me
‘cause I just really need to know If this is love or are we simply sharing air to breathe
(ohohoh uhuhuhuh)
When the waves get rough will you be here when I wake up
When the waves get rough will you be here when I wake up

I fall asleep to lullabies built of thunder
Peace settles in but then my mind plays the hunter
Thoughts pile up till their mountain tops
Pulling me along till I'm a little lost
It's killing me

I don’t mean to be a bother but I was pondering If you’d cross an ocean for me
‘cause I just really need to know If this is love or are we simply sharing air to breathe
(ohohoh uhuhuhuh)
When the waves get rough will you be here
When I wake up
When the waves get rough will you be here
When I wake up

Asking for a simple truth

It’s little overdue

‘cause I just really need to know if this is love or are we simply sharing air to breathe
(ohohoh uhuhuhuh)
When the waves get rough will you be here when I wake up
When the waves get rough will you be here when I wake
