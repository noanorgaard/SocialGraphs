Whoever said it was easy
Must have had it pretty good
Must have had it pretty good
I want you, boy, just to please me
Don't tell me that you could
Don't tell me that you could

It's beautiful in the way we move
But what's a girl to do when you can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful but we must restrain
When your mind is split two ways
That's when the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you
You might also like
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
You have someone that loves you

You want me close so I hear you
I thought I made it clear
Don't whisper in my ear
My heart, it keeps getting weaker
I know you want me near
But your love is what I fear

It's beautiful, the way you move
But what's a boy to do
When he can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful, but I must explain
My mind's not in a good place
And so the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you
Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
Yeah she loves you too
The way that I do

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you
Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you

That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves 

I dream it all the time, girl
Waking up warm in your arms and without a care
No money ain't a problem, girl
Just give me the time and the place, and I'll be there
Oh oh

Cause I would go the distance for you, baby
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines
You're on my mind, all the time
We are not wasting this

Cause you and I we're good together, oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together
You might also like
And I tell you all too much, girl
But I want you to know what you got is a natural gift
I'd unwrap you all the time, girl
Don't wanna be rude but I would, do you catch my drift?
Yeah

Cause I would go the distance for you, baby
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines

You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better

Oh, you know I would go the distance
Just to be amongst your presence
Cause I am losing my mind
Every second of time
Keep wait
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together
