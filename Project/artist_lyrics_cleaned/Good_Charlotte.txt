Everybody, put up your hands
Say, "I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love"
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, "I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love"
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, "I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love"
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, "I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love"
He was always giving her attention
Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up; she's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't comin' home now
He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her
When he first met her, when they first got together

To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
We break up, it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire you know everything is good here
Stop what you're doing, you don't wanna ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

Love
Love
Now you know what to do
So come on, feeling 

It's a new day, but it all feels old
"It's a good life!" That's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm sayin' is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

"Go to college or university
Get a real job," that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm sayin' is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

You shake it once, that's fine
You shake it twice, that's okay
You shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again


You, don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm sayin' is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you (Be just like you)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
Another loser anthem (Woah-oh)
Another loser anthem (Woah-oh)
Another loser anthem (Woah-oh)
Another loser 

Always see it on TV
Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
They would fall, fall

Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back?
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​
