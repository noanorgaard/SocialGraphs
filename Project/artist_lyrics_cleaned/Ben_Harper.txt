If you don't like my fire, then don't come around
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes, I'm gonna burn one down

My choice is what I choose to do
And if I'm causing no harm, it shouldn't bother you
Your choice is who you choose to be
And if you're causin' no harm, then you're alright with me

If you don't like my fire, then don't come around
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes, I'm gonna burn one down

Herb the gift from the earth
And what's from the earth is of the greatest worth
So before you knock, it try it first
Oh, you'll see it's a blessing and it's not a curse
You might also like
If you don't like my fire, then don't come around
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down
Yes I'm gonna burn one
