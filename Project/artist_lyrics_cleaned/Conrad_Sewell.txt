There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

Some nights, I kid myself I treated you right
Lying to myself, I didn't know
If I'm honest, I could've done it better
You said we had it pretty much perfect
And then you told me that you loved me
But you're sorry, you needed something better, better

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
Can we start again, can we start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends, can we start again

So I guess I'm gonna let you go
But you get to keep a little bit of my soul
So I guess I'm gonna write you out
But I don't think I can do it to me right now
Let's pretend that time heals all

There's a hole in the middle of my heart again
But I'm not afraid to start, again
Start again, I'm gonna start again
There's a hole in the middle and it never mends
It never mends
But I've gotta try to start 

When I think about love, you are right beside me
I think about us, you will always find me
When my heart is lost, I know that you'll guide me
I think about all the little things that still remind me

These days, reflections like a stranger
You are so much braver, braver than me
Save me, save me from my demons
Teach to defeat them
And lead me to peace

When I think about love, you are right beside me
I think about us, you will always find me
When my heart is lost, I know that you'll guide me
I think about all the little things that still remind me
You might also like
When I'm living like there's nothing left to lose
When I turn my back on everything I knew
When I settle for the silence in the room
Remind me
Remind me
Remind me
Remind me of you

I think about love, and you are right beside me
I think about us, I know that you'll find me
When my heart gets lost, I know that you’ll guide me
I think about all the little things that still remind me
Oh all my life
You'll remind 

I can't do it by myself, need you now
Need you right now
You know there ain’t nobody else
Who can save me from this hell
Need you now, I need you right now
