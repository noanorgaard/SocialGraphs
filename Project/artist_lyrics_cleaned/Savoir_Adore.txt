Is it savage?
This edible cry
A primitive beast
This feeling inside
(This feeling inside)

Late at night we are broken
In the darkness of the words unspoken
There's a scream inside somewhere
I can't get enough
Give me more of your love
Your love (I can't get enough)

Does it scare you?
Does it feel unkind?
I'm not crazy
I'm just out of my mind

Are you a savage?
Are you the devil disguised?
A primitive beast
I feel you inside

You can stay where you are
I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning
In the morning
You can stay where you are
So don't you worry
Don't you worry
Keep on sleeping

Now you see
What you thought was yours could never be had, oh-oh
Take a look around, try to understand
That it's a game that you'll never hold onto very long, long
Where we are isn't just a place where everything remains

You can stay where you are
I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning
In the morning
You can stay where you are
So don't you worry
Don't you worry
Keep on sleeping

Not the same (I will wake up)
Watch it tumble down, falling all around, around (I will wake up in the morning)
Can you stand watching it undo all that's made of you? (Don't you worry, don't you worry, keep on sleeping)
I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning
So don't you worry
Don't you worry
Keep on sleeping



Stumble, repeat, stumble, repeat
Get off your feet, get off your feet

If the feeling don’t fit
You'll just have to stick with it
Got a soul so big
We were giants at the start of it
No we’re never gonna quit
Not even just a little bit
No we’re never gonna quit
We are giants, giants, giants
At the heart of it

This world is blind
Eyes so deep and difficult
If we took the time
We’d see the ease in being kind
Throw it all in the river
And let it all go
You don’t have to suffer
To let yourself grow
Watch it burn into cinders
Can you read the smoke

If the feeling don't fit
You'll just have to stick with it
No we're never gonna quit
Cause we are giants at the heart of it
