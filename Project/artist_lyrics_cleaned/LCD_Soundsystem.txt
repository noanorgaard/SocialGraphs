But still I'm coming home to you

Christmas will shove you down
So just lay back in the snow
That quiet wind won't wake
What inside you has grown cold
And Christmas will drown your love
Like a storm down from above
On your fading memories of a normal life
Oh, while I thought to make you mine
Believing in the line
That your heart would melt with time
And though you're out with them again
Your thick and fickle friends
They might replace the love that ends

Walking up to me expecting
Walking up to me expecting words
It happens all the time
Present company excepted
Present company except the worst
It happens every night

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Present company excluded every time
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Present company, the best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company expect it
Present company, just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Present company excluded in every way

Don't you want me to wake up
Then give me just a bit of your time?
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time
We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
Just go and throw your little hands up
It's late
Oh
Honey, it's late
Oh

I miss the way the night goes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean, ah
Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show

Put your little feet down
And hang out
Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go

And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do, oh

In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning

It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached
From this position
I can say "serious," or "cop-out," or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

And me being uptight

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home
And have learned a little more about my neighbourhood
Which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

And so it’s pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

Now I have been untied

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway
As a compromised, aggregate person
I'm amazed at my decision to play

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we pulled from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night
So you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up
Because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from TV
So times have been tough and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, and rinsed out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself
How much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?
And so it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each

From this position
I feel an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly
I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it
Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery
And then a couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant
You could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized
Regret anyway
But what you want for now
Is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like
Is planning to stay
And all this time
It's so nice

New York, you're safer and you're wasting my time
Our records all show you were filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stores when you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
And so the boring collect, I mean all disrespect
In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the twist, but we're fresh out of shout
Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out

New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart, Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown

Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
