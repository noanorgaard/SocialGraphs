Link up next time, B-R-B
Woah, woah B-R-B (I'ma be right back)

If I say, be right back
Wait, not gonna lie, that's probably cap
Seems like you're new to this
Like you were born yesterday
Still being chased
When I was young, I was scared
Look, kind of good with a nosebleed
All the good times are like that now
I don't want to fall behind either
My eyes are focused on what's real
My eyes are focused on what's real
Dream in dream, I'm zooming out
What you been up to?
Man, just breathing
Years flew by just like that
Only sorry to myself
My fingers crossed
Hold on
I'ma be right back
You might also like
My fingers crossed
Side by side anywhere we go
That's not necessary
But we've come too far to turn back now
But no, "See you later"
We born as family
We die as a family
I learned something good from this
Don't need no rewards and punishments
Live like Kwon Min Sik, go like Kwon Min Sik
I'd be crazy to go back to where I started
Non-believer, I gotta leave her
Watch me closely
One point difference, buzzer beater

In the middle of summer, D-I-G my hole
I'm not going far, B-R-B, okay
Since we're sad, P-I-C for the gram
You're V-I-P too, okay
I'm still making songs
Can't stop 'til I die
Too busy makin' history
They say nothing lasts forever
But found something that lasts forever, H1GHR gang
No no no kizzy
Uh, yeah, uh
I still don't know how much
I don't care, no mo tho
Uh, yeah, uh
We'll meet again
After looking around
Ain't show window family like them
Those rappers keep bluffin', yeah
I remember the beginning
This can't be it, period
Woah, woah
Release another album next year then
I'ma go touring city to cities
My brothers already paved the way
Jun-won, Min-sik, WOOGIE, Woodie, Groovy
HAON, My G, JAY B, SMMT
It's not called "Jung (정)"
Let’s just call it "Hyung" We a team
Learned what family meant at the age of 20
H1GHR gang, no label, issa la familia
Belief without any business
Don't get too cocky, that's toxic
Don't get too cocky, that's toxic
This is just my beginning compared to my brothers
This is the first and last B-R-B
Let's stay on track, Naughty
Let's not buy a car, Naughty
Let's not get in trouble, Naughty
Do it when I die, goodbye

H1GHR gang 'til I die
You know, we got it on lock
Many memories in the past five years
Runs through my mind often
Nothing has changed except
My taxes, woah, woah
Always multiplying, we get the bread up
That's all thanks to our fans
Can't ever forget that
H1GHR gang, always rolling deep
Talkin’ ‘bout double up, no
Triple up, no kizzy
We're worldwide
Still reppin' Seoul city
My mind still stay the same in different times
You don't know how it feels
We'll be right back
No worries
Wherever we go, we're already together
We shared our hearts
Family forever
We can just meet again, we'll be right back

Be right back
H1GHR will be right back
Yeah, we got that
'Til I D-I-E, we right there
Gather up, B-R-B

We hypnotize like B-I-G, B-I-G
Fuck a piece of paper, yeah, the fam is fam
I don't tie it up, just make a plan
Even if you do it on your own, still help you build your brand
Don't call me boss, I'm your brother man
H1GHR gang, we in the place
Never come in second place
Legends don't die
So firstly, B-R-B, B-R-B
