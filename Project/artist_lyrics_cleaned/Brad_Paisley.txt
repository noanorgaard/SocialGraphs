A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me

And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band

Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and it Feels So Right
And it’s Love In The First Degree

Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
Even Barry White ain't  going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start

So the one you loved just left you for nothing
And you're down
Or you lost your job and you need a drink
You look around and start to think
That no one understands what you been 

And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

And, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, well, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full

You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause

We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch

But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shocking

Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to

I hope you understand

I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand

Drive until the map turns blue

Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh let her go boys

Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone
You want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

You can stay right there when the daylights gone
Play truth or dare and it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades and ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near


Well, that's like just last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector
In the house was going off
And she was just about to cry
Until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect
But she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't
'Cause how boring would that be?
It's the little imperfections
It's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions
And we're lost, but holding hands
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

When she's laying on my shoulder
On the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep
So does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it
'Cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel
That I don't want to wake her up

Yeah, I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it

'Cause online, I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six-foot-five and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati, I'm a black belt in Karate
And I love a good glass of wine
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothin' serious
'Cause even on a slow day, I can have a three-way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online

I get home, I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac
In real life, the only time I've
Ever even been to L.A
Was when I got the chance with the marchin' band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade

Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it, it's all gonna stop

Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air

And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
Before I handed her her purse
I said, "You'll only get this back on one condition"

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin'
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring
Out of the pocket of my shirt

Well that's alright, that's ok
If you don't feel important, honey
All I've got to say is
To the world
You may be just another girl
But to me
Baby, you are the world

To the waiter at the restaurant
You're just another tip
To the guy at the ice cream shop
You're just another dip
When you can't get reservations
Cause you don't have the clout
Or you didn't get an invitation

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time, it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night

You can't kill it with goodbye
It always finds a place to hide
Inside your heart for your whole life
Love is never-ending

When the lights have all gone down
It'll still be hanging 'round
Even when you think it's lost, it can still be found
When every memory has been made
And the pages start to fade
And every prayer you ever prayed is heaven bound
When you think the ride is over
You're back at the beginning
Love is never-ending

When a man and woman start growing old
The fire of passion may grow cold
But what they got still warms their soul
Love is never-ending

There's a place I know about
Where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now, what do you say?
Girl, I can hardly wait
To get a little mud on the tires

'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there

Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine
This time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count

Is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck

With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land

"When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at 8
And she came down the stairs at 8:30
She said, 'I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on'
But let me tell you, son, she sure looked pretty"

But I don't mind waitin' on a woman"

Waitin' on a woman"
