How much do you
Commit yourself?

Oh, it's my life

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

Oh, I'd tell myself
What good do you do?

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say, "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"

Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd
He said, "We'll meet again, we are bloody, yet unbowed"
Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas day on the roof down at 20 Oxford Street

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say, "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"

On the roof with the nun chucks, Trevor broke a lot of bones
But Haji had a sword like that guy in Indiana Jones
Police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape (Oi, oi)
But then Haji saw the north star shining more then ever
So he made a tourniquet from his turban saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon

I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say, "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But oi to the world and everybody wins!

And now I'm stuck in the

You got me for your prey

A likely story, but
Leave a message and I'll call you back

You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you, "Please let me be"

Sappy, pathetic little me
That was the girl I used to be
You had me on my knees

I'd trade you places any day
I'd never thought you could be that way
But you looked like me on Sunday

You came in with the breeze
On Sunday morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
I thought I knew you (Whoa-oh)
I thought I knew you (Whoa-oh)
I thought I knew you well
So well

You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good but fit so strange
Out of fashion, so I can complain

'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

Oh, I've had it up to here

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me

I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag, watchin' all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (Hey baby)

I'm just sippin' on chamomile
Watchin' boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
