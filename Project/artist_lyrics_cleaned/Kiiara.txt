But your brother was a good substitute for you

And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

Do you remember when they bowed to us like kings, my friend?
We were the champions, we were the champions
Hey now even when castles half-blown to the wind
I know they talk about us now and then
Saying we were the champions
We were the champions
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
(Do it!)

Sippin’ on that Tennessee

And I got way too many feelings
Way too much emotion
All the Xans inside my body
I say fuck it, keep on drowning
Yeah, you can bring a juice, I'll match you
Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are
But I'd dive into your ocean
And yeah, you say you smoking grams
I'm smoking into the GRAMMYs
Say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key
Think you understand, I don't know me
Still, I get along with your best friends
Even better with your family

We be faded when I'm sober
Sober when I'm faded
Over-scrutinized by all your counterparts
There's no debating
You say it's 'cause they jaded
Yeah, they jealous that I made it
Do you remember that first time

Back when we really didn't know it
We were searching for some
Now they pay full advance
And there ain't no fucking discussion
At the stage, yeah, they jumping because it's like that
