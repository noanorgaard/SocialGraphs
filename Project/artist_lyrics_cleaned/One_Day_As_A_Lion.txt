Muhammad and Christ, word life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse

In this era where DJs behave, be paid to be slaves
We raid airwaves to be sane, and
What's rainin' from the station
Cash fascination, like livin' dead Fed agents
Distract us fast from a disaster's wrath for sure
Air war was flooded like the 9th ward
On the AM, on the AM, turn and face them
Hatred and mayhem, slay them, dangerous I take razor steps
It's the swing from the bling to the bang on the left
It's the murderous return, boom back full strap
Your six that got clipped you can't clap back
With minimal lift and criminal flow
I’m killin' them soft and billin' them for
Everything stole
And once again I'm that nail in the wrist of they Christmas
Watch me make they family a witness

Muhammad and Christ, word life, would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
Both Muhammad and Christ would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert, full of bullets, let your body rot
With my chrome, with my verse, with my body rock
