I make my days my nights that's when my heart gets pumpin
I'll take you for a ride, my nights only just started
Show me some place I'd like, make me feel like I'm dreamin
Oh and I won't wake up

Though I don't know where I go
Light had never done much for me
But lead me down a lonely road
Hit the lights so I can see
That I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy

Why are your eyes still closed, can't do much when we're sleepin'
I'll wake you up and show the night is where my heart is
We don't need daylight to feel right, come close to me, you
And we'll stay up
You might also like
Though I don't know where I go
Light had never done much for me
But lead me down a lonely road
Hit the lights so I can see
That you and me are company
Enough to make the sun explode
We'll lose the lights and harmony
In the night I'll have control
'Cause I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy


Though I don't know where I go
Light had never done much for me
But lead me down a lonely road
Hit the lights so I can see
That you and me are company
Enough to make the sun explode
We'll lose the lights and harmony
In the night I'll have control
'Cause I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun shy la da da da da
I'm a little sun shy
I'm a little sun
