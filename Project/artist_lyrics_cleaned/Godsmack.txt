Candles raise my desire
Why I'm so far away
No more meaning to my life
No more reason to stay

Freezin' feelin'
Breathe in, breathe in
I'm comin' back again

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Hazing clouds rain on my head
Empty thoughts fill my ears
Find my shade by the moonlight
Why my thoughts aren't so clear

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Never did I wanna be here again

Let's take a blast to the moon, baby
I sit around wishing you well
How I'm craving you
Yeah
Every time I'm near you
I always wanna swallow you down
I'll be right here if you need me

In my life, I'll need you here
Don't ask why and I'll never disappear
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
Ah, yeah

Let's take a trip to the stars far away
Where were you when I was down?
Staring into the dead
Dead
My pain is caused by my pleasure
And my soul mate lives in your body
I can't get you out of my head
It never goes away

In your eyes, you can bid me farewell
Don't ever try to understand my situation
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
It always comes when I least expect it
When I'm looking for love
Always seem to be regretting it
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
Ah, yeah
Yeah

"I had nothing to do with it.."
"Tolerance. Tolerance for pain."

"And we can't have weakness."
No, I can't be stopped
"I had nothing to do with it.."
"I had nothing to do with it."

Don't be sad that I feel this way
I'd rather just keep making the same fucking mistakes
Over and over and over again
Please, can't this fucking mistake be over?

"I had nothing to do with this."
"This is so bad, what did you do??"

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Stand alone, stand alone...

You're always hiding behind
Your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think
That we can see your face?
Resurrected back before
The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way

I'm not afraid of fading...

I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside

And now it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)
Make me believe that this place
Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

I stand alone inside
I stand alone

Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside
