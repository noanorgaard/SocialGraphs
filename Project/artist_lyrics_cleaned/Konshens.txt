I see a ting that I touched, tell me about talkin' stage, gotta tell her "Don’t force it"
Beef man, pepper and salt it, me and RJ gotta pull up, no talkin'
Trap, you ain't got a rack to your name, my bro brick layin', we don't know about Shoreditch
Rental, I never insured it, M25, gotta whip that calmly
Man try beef with my dargy, Warzone ting how I come third party
My little nigga can't lose that cash, I drop YGs, do it like Kehlani
I don't rock Gucci or Armani, ST from ST, I can't
Squash that beef like fruit and barley, still got a one black star like Kwame

Three car convoy in Sutton, my mum got matching whips with Yungen
Should’ve made Shanei hold on somethin’
But it never would've worked ’cause the girl too stubborn
Young G's talking my name on the ends
Gotta tell a man, "Please don't risk it"
On a right day, man ah just frisk him
On a wrong day, I'm gettin’ man airlifted
I'm in Hollywood Hills with a white Rolls-Royce
And a one brownin' from Compton
The Lambo parked just in front
Man pull up to the bumper and do it like Konshens
She wanna go LV, no problem
Went for the cheapest bag, that's nonsense
I took a hundred bags from Barclays bank
No cap, you can go and ask Ellie
That one mine, Bouncing Betty
The bag 4k, like a HD telly
Best believe that I'm back like Nelly
Chest petite with a back like jelly
I'm seein' man send indirects
If you wanna war man then you better be vocal
My right hand got a semi, that's local
And this Browning, I can't post on socials
My girl gotta be far from social, I don't wanna see her at Carni'
Four-double-eight in the party, LBC how I nicked the Ferrari
Girls say we're the littiest batch in South London and, bro, it's a fact
Airport, we're going for bants, I hopped out the plane, I ain't going Verdansk
What you know about telling a ten-ten to keep her clothes on and moving good?
I ain't on beating or misogyny, it's mahogany, I got bougie wood
Look, Airbnb with the guys, it's a white man's face that I use to book
Chill with the stupid looks, or it's gonna be a kettle that I use to cook

I see a ting that I touched, tell me about talkin' stage, I'm tellin' her, "Don't stretch it"
Beef, man can never neglect it
Me and MC, we pull up to inspect it
Trap, you ain't never made ten bags
Brick layin', it's like Tetris
Dig deeper, I never invested
M23, I whip that slowly (Slowly)
We got heat in South, when I head Central, don't carry shit
My shooter thought 'bout touchin' the city till I made that call like Sir Alex did
If the bar low, then I'ma limbo, akimbo blade for a jimbo
San that, Tan that, Fran like 'Cisco
Real old school like Adi' and Timbo
More time I ain't tryna step out Co-Op
My hood hot like Jane and Finch
Me and RJ on survival mode
Still do it two-player like Kane and Lynch
No lynch when a hand got a—
Oh, she-she want a hand, gotta tek this ting
Don't flinch, seven inch got a punch like the first of the month
No pinch, no past, two cars like
(Let's do this)
Sixteen stepped inside, shotgun, got one
Not one that you find in the side of your best friend's ride
Slide, bro, it's a fact
Downtown, she goin' for bants, I hopped out the plane, I ain't going
