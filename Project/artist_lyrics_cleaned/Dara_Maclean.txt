Now blameless, You call me Holy
I’ve been forgiven, You call me righteous and free
Now spotless, You call me worthy
I am Your child, You call me chosen
I’m Yours, I am Yours
I will boldly come
Running straight to the One
Singing over me
Your songs of salvation
No one can take this from me
I’m a child that You name free
Nothing will separate us
I’m held by You
Oh I know, oh I know I’m

I am Yours, I am Yours, I am Yours
And I am Yours, I am Yours, I am Yours
I am Yours, yes I am, yes I am
