Hold on, I'm coming (Hold)
Hold on, I'm coming (Hold)

Oh, yeah, I see you, baby
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute
Ain't no one here
We don't have to talk about it
I know you'll understand it
You know how to treat a lady
You're the only one here

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Hold on

Oh, yeah, I see you, baby
Gotta feel for the jeans you're wearing
Gonna leave the rhythm, just a minute
Ain't no one here
We don't have to talk about it
I know you'll understand it
You know how to treat a lady
You're the only one here
You might also like
Hold on
Hold on
Hold
