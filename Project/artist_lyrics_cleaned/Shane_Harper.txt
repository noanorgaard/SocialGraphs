I can't keep chasin' you around
All of this running, just bringing me down
It's got me down
Every time I look at you the angels sing
I hope you hear them, too, oh

Well, baby, are you down, down, down, down?
I could wait forever and a day
Just to have you look my way (Just look my way)
Look my way, yeah

Just to hear you sing
Baby, for you I'd do anything
I'd fight Superman just to hold your hand
Have to get one step closer to you

And now you're in my arms

I'd climb the highest mountain
I'd sail across the sea
For you I'd do anything
I'd plan a picnic on the moon
Just for me and you, just for me and you
I'd write you a million love songs
Just to hear you sing
Baby, for you I'd do everything
Yeah, I'd fight Superman just to hold your hand
Have to get one step closer to you
Oh, yeah
Just to get one step closer to
