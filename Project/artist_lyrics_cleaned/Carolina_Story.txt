Towards  the  open  road
Pulled  by  the  sounds
Of  the  Carolina  shores
And  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean
You  lay  serene
In  a  quite  peace
Spinning  in  your  dreams
But  tonight
I  walk
Alone
Shadows  of  midnight
Cascade  upon  the  slopes
From  the  untold  unknown
The  story  will  unfold
A  whisper  from  the  trees
It’s  a  quiet  mystery
But  there’s  no  trace
Of  footprints  in  the  road
I’m  on  a  journey
Of  my  own
Lightning  strikes
Thunder  in  my  mind
Rain  in  my  eyes
I  travel  time
And  it’s  hard  to  see
The  clearest  road
But  the  strongest  winds
Carry  me  home

I’m  on  a  journey  of  my  own
Journey  of  my  own
Across  the  distance
In  the  sea  of  time
We’re  bathed  in  the  same  moonlight
Our  parallel  minds
In  the  star  filled  sky  I  still  see  your  eyes
Now  I’m  traveling  alone
And  it’s  a  beautiful  ride
But  there’s  no  trace
Of  footprints  in  the  road
I’m  on  a  journey  of  my  own
Lightning  strikes
Thunder  in  my  mind
Rain  in  my  eyes
I  travel  time
And  it’s  hard  to  see
The  clearest  road
But  the  strongest  winds  carry  me
Carry  me  home
I’m  on  a  journey  of  my  own.....
I’m  on  a  journey  of  my  own
Journey  of  my  own
Journey  of  my  own
My  own....  I’m  on  a  journey
I'm on a journey of my
