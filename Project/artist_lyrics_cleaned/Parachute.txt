Headlights on
As I'm speeding down the road I never turned
Tell myself
If I'm fast enough I'll finally get to her

But oh
Jennie, come back
You're the one I needed
I still, feel you, in my arms and now
I know better
There's no going back at all
I was sleeping and I've finally woken up

Dark sunglasses
Bleach blonde, tan skin
I still see it, the way she smiled
On beach days she'd swim
I didn't know it but
I was blinded by her light

Love is the ocean
You either jump in or you don't
She was the current
You're either with her or you're not
And I'll never catch up
Because I waited too long
Time is a straight line
And life always goes on, yeah

Jennie, come back

Who gave you moves, girl?
Moves girl, moves girl

Sooner or later

Catch the light as we move, girl
Your skin on my skin

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly

Stay with me
Baby, stay with me
Tonight, don't leave me alone (Me alone)
She shows me everything she used to know
Picture frames and country roads
When the days were long and the world was small
She stood by as it fell apart
Separate rooms and broken hearts
But I won't be the one to let you go, oh

When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly
Don't run away

And it's hard to love again
When the only way it's been
When the only love you knew
Just walked away
If it's something that you want
Darling, you don't have to run
You don't have to go
Just stay with me, baby, stay with me

Well, I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see

The moon above you and the streets below (Don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me slowly
I'm not sure where this is gonna go
But in this moment, all I know
Is the skyline, through the window
The moon above you and the streets below (Baby, don't let go)
Hold my breath as you're moving in
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby, don't run
Just kiss me 

They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need
She's all I need

Well I had my ways, they were all in vain
But she waited patiently
It was all the same, all my pride and shame
And she put me on my feet

[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

And when that world slows down, dear
And when those stars burn out, here
Oh she'll be here, yes she'll be here

I want you forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, forever and always

She pulls up to the entrance, she walks right to the front desk
They lead her down a million halls
A maze that's never-ending
They talk about what happened but she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face
As she walks into the room
She sits by his bedside, holds his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have and the good life
The house on the hillside
Where they would stay

Stay there forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, and always remember
Whether rich or for poor, or for better
We'll still love each other, forever and always

Then she gets an idea and calls in the nurses
Brings up the chaplain and he says a couple verses
She borrows some rings from the couple next door
Everybody's laughing as the tears fall on the floor
She looks into his eyes, and she says

I want you forever; forever and always
Through the good and the bad, and the ugly
We'll grow old together, and always remember
Whether happy or sad or whatever
We'll still love each other, forever and always
Forever and always, forever and always

She finishes the vows but the beeps are getting too slow
His voice is almost too low
As he says, "I love you forever, forever and always
Please just remember even if I'm not there
I'll always love you, forever and
