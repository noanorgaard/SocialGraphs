I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

It was way too easy to say those words you said
And the look on your face, I could tell there was nothing left
Almost wished we were fighting, screaming, and crying, but
Not a drop of a tear, didn't know how to feel, I was numb

I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

I could try to hold on if I thought I could change your mind
But I don’t think I can when I feel like I feel tonight

I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye


I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there

She knows how to work them cut off things
She knows how to get me to do about anything
How to bat those eyes, swing them hips
How to rock that cherry red lipstick
She knows I can't say no

Yeah baby that's all about all I can say
Whatever you want baby, as long as you kiss me that way
My heart of stone melts in her hands
I'm getting used to changing plans
Ain't no other girl in the world that can do me like that

And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake

Through the wind and the rain

Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be

And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still

And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up


But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you

I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to

You're like second nature baby, you're just like breathin'
A melody that you hear and you can't forget
And time goes by and I still need you
Yeah you're worth the heartbreak and no regret

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you
