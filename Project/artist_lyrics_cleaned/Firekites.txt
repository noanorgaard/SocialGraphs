Last ships follow
The course of arrows
Last days away
Late last night
Late last night
Late last night
Alone

New day's morning
(Could this be the last time I see)
Swallows falling
(Don't let this be falling)
The arrow aims at home
The last days of the storm

Another time...
Another
Another time...
Another
Another time...
Another
Another time...
Another... way

Last ships follow
Last days away
Late last night
Late last night
Late last night
