She was a termite, eating away at my roots
I was just a lost soul who needed a home
I was filling a void with you

And I can't, can't wait
'Til you see, see, see
What death and disgust have done to me
And I spent three years wishing for two things
That one day, you'd break and I'd get to see
How all the choices you made could drive you insane
I wish we never met

As angry as I sound
That's just the way I cover up the way I feel
I've been that way for years and years
A slave to broken hearts and sex appeal

I spent some time in a bad place at 18
Wishing I could see something through clear eyes
Do you ever wake up to realize
That your life is meaningless?
Does it give you strength or lead you to
Your grave at a young age?

Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume it's just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility, yeah

It seems that when I ran away from my past
All my dignity, my faith, my pride got left back
And now I think it's time that I realize
Self pity's meaningless
Though I'm 10 feet deep
I'll claw my way back out from in my grave

Now I realize, I'd give anything I have
To walk a day in my old shoes
Wondering what my first smoke would be like
My first fuck, my next fuck up
The next band that would change my life
And it changed my life
And it changed my life

My head against the wall

So when you lose your mind
You'll find it at the bottom of the mess that's your life
Go take your own advice
Keep hoping that the lies never catch up to you in time

Your name is filth
'Cause that's all you spew from your mouth
Well, I think that your moral compass is broke
It only points you south
And I wear my scars
Like rings on a tree, there they are
Showing my age and proving where I've been so far
So far, so far, so far (So far, so far)

Carry on, with the guise of a sheep in a storm
You're a wolf and you're losing the ground that you're on

But hey hey, I've got things to say
I've lost control of life
I don't know how many times I've tried
To undo the knot you've tied
My face is red, and people change
I've changed for good this time

And I've followed you around
I've seen you all over town
I've got a laundry list telling me why
It follows to prove I was right

You are the monster I was scared you'd be
And now you're blaming it on your surroundings
And your horns came out so gradually
But honey, you're no match for me
You're no match for me

I've watched your name get trampled
In the mess through which you've travelled
And the friends you swore that you were so above
Who's gonna care about you?
When you don't care about anyone
So go and search for some new sucker
Sing a song and say a prayer for me

Scientists they couldn't fix me
I'm so tired of getting out of bed
But who would want to die as a cowardly little child?
When our time is up, will we be ashamed or proud?

Telling lie after lie
After lie, but where's the line?
You burn bridges, you're breaking down dams

And I look so strong
When the weight of all the world
Don't take its toll
And I'd choose my sides
If I believed in what was right
But I'm all wrong

I'm not larger than life, I'm not taller than trees
Do I mean what I say, is it just this disease? Where I never go home
Never telling the truth how this life eats away
Admitting I'm fake
And I'm questioning whether this whole thing was worth it to die poor and all alone?

What if for one minute
He's given a chance
And he does something brilliant?
But he'd rather not know
His walls protective
His bedroom's a prison

Now is your chance, boy
Just ignore the dreadful things they say
Go on, give up, you'll never win
No crying now, they're watching him
His blood will boil, the kids will sing
Learn to drown before you learn to swim

Stepped out of his shell
Alone's an addiction

Oh, what a mistake
He is charcoal within
He could never do right by them
He stands on the stage with a grin
But he drops on his knees
And is waiting for anything he can believe in
He's lost, he just wants to be ordinary
