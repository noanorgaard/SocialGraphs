I don’t want to feel no more
Can you make me beautiful?
Make no mistake I was there
Were you there? Why were you quiet?
There is so much more to say
But you don’t say a word

I’m the sun, I’m the rain
Pull me under, under again
I wanna go, I wanna go where the wind blows
I’m the sun, I’m the rain
Pull me under, under again
I wanna go, I wanna go where the wind blows

Oh, pull me under, under
It’s enough, just let me go
And the ocean above
Lets me know that I am home
Pull me under, under
It’s enough, just let me go
Me under

No I can’t give no more
Than I’ve given before, no no

Pull me under, under again
I wanna go, I wanna go where the wind blows
I’m the sun, I’m the rain
Pull me under, under again
I wanna go, I wanna go where the wind blows

Oh, pull me under, under
It’s enough, just let me go
And the ocean above
Lets me know that I am home
Pull me under, under
It’s enough, just let me go
Me under

You, it’s all that I want
Pull me under, it’s all that I want (Ah)

Oh, pull me under, under
It’s enough, just let me go
And the ocean above
Lets me know that I am home
I’ll be under
It’s enough, just let me go
Me under
(Oh, oh, I’m the sun, I’m the rain, pull me under)
(Oh, ah, oh)
(Oh, oh, I’m the sun, I’m the rain pull me under)
(Oh, pull me
