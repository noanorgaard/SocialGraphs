So baby don't fake it
When you already know
You can't shake it
And it's starting to show
I can't fill that hole in your heart
Like I could at the start

I felt a fire burning long before
I even saw the smoke
The tragedy just looming over the horizon
Still there's a part of me that hopes
That we could just turn it around
But it would only do no good
Just remember there's nobody else
That could love you like I could

So dark
How did something so sweet tear us apart?
Oh, on a sinking ship with a heavy heart
Ooh
How did we get so dark?

Nobody warned you
The tables would turn
And I could have told you
Everything you've learnt
Would burn to dust
Now there's no one you can trust
Just someone you used to love
Someone you used to love

But I need some medication
Tell me you've got what I need
I know you've got the cure
Antidote hidden up your sleeve

I just can't help myself
Thinking you're with someone else
Sick to the bone
I don't wanna sleep
I read the warning sign
You said I'd be alright
Left on my own
I don't wanna sleep

My eyes are still burning red
So turn the lights out
You're not so hard to forget
With all the lights out

Every time I'm stuck in the ground
Spin me round, won't you spin me round
You're a void, a crack in the mirror
See me now, if you could see me now
You slipped through
The night
Then walked out
Skin tight
But you don't matter that much to me
No you don't matter that much to me

You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, and washed away no sin
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free, yeah

Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you

I let it go 'cause I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to talk it out
I said I'd go, put myself on show

I've got love on my fingers
Lust on my tongue
You say you got nothing
So come out and get some
Heartache to heartache
I'm your wolf, I'm your man
I say run little monster
Before you know who I am

Hey little creature, tell me what's on your mind
Where've you been hiding? And can I come this time?
So pleased to please ya, and rip that heart off your sleeve
What we discover...

Go ahead, muck about
I got my conscience twisted
Pull your hair, make me shout
It's just that you insisted I was good for nothing
