What lies ahead may be unknown
As I brave the unseen road
God; go with me
Every hidden sacrifice
Through the watches of the night
God; go with me

Through it all I know
I am not alone

I am Fearless, in Your presence
You're all around me, all around me
In my weakness, You are strongest
You surround me, You surround me

Say the Word that sets my heart
On what You've done and who You are
God; You're for me
Every hard and heavy step
I will see Your faithfulness
God; You are for me, for me
You might also like
I am Fearless, in Your presence
You're all around me, all around me
In my weakness, You are strongest
You surround me, You surround me

No fear in the crashing waves
No fear when the cost is great
No fear in the midnight hour
You've given me a spirit of power
No fear in the crashing waves
No fear when the cost is great
No fear in the midnight hour
You've given me a spirit of power
Of power, I am not afraid
No I am not afraid

And I am Fearless, in Your presence
You're all around me, all around me
In my weakness, You are strongest
You surround me, You surround me
And I am Fearless, in Your presence
You're all around me, all around me
In my weakness, You are strongest
You surround me, You surround
