Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth

Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Not thinking of me and you

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair (Running my fingers)
In the hallway, making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
I can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

So take your time, we got a night

So addicted to you

Last night I allmost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain''t goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
That I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain''t goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain''t goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain''t never goin nowhere

I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
Untill I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby heres the rest of it

Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain''t goin nowhere, I ain't goin nowhere
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
That I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain''t goin nowhere

People talking in the streets
Saying how bad you wanna give it to me
I was saying no
To get in there sweet
She better know what the rules gon' be

We stick, then we split
Ain’t no hints ‘bout you coming with me

But you don't know how to let it go)

Rings like those, cuff links like these

Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
