All that I could say was

We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walks past me I say, "He-hey, hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey)

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like I ain't said a word, stood there like, "Man"
Girl, I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hit me hard in some kind of place, like, man

Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I say, say (Say, say, say)

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go

Find ourselves and lose our minds today, hey

Latinos y gringos gozando, ¿me entiendes? (Woo)
For those that thought that we would stop
Definitely don't have a mind to think with, brainless (Ha-ha)
Most of them broke, but they're famous (That's right)
