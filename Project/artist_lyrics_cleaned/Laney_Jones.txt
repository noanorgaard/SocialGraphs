Run wild, run free
The sky's beneath our feet
Run wild, run free
Won't hide what we were meant to be

There's a dream that waits like a tiger
An ember that grows to a fire
And we climbing to the greatest heights
The world can't stop us now
They try to bring us down but we just burn brighter

Run wild, run free
The sky's beneath our feet
Run wild, run free
Won't hide what we were meant to be
