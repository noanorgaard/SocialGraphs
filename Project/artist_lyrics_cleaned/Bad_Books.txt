We started a fire
That was never supposed to burn out
You started a band
That was cool for awhile
But it turned pretty bland
I started a fight
With the neighbor next door
And his pesky wife
You started a job
That you hate when you're sober
And hate even more when you're not

I know you hate me too
Always say you do

And you moved to Japan
Thought a clean bill of health and a camera
Could show you the plan
I bought a bird that repeats what I say
But I'm lonely is all that he's heard
You found a guy
That is clearly the opposite me
With a black motor bike
I dicked around
But its just like a movie that's picture
Is off with the sound
You might also like
I know you hate me too
Always say you do


And you started to write
It was subtle at first
But the danger was clearly in sight
I don't reply
Due to a lack of an ego
And laziness cuts like a knife
You say that you're good
Had a baby with biker
And named him Forest Whitaker
I'm laying low
On the probable chance
You convince me to give him a home

I know you hate me too
Always say you do
I know that you hate me too
Always say you
