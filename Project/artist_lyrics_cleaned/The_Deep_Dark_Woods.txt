To go to the days when you were mine
If I had a dollar for every song
We wouldn't dragging this blues along
So come on sugar mama, take a chance with me
Im a lot older than used to be
This hard luck life has got me down
These blues will drive me out of town
So take me back to the windy coast
Back to the place I love the most
I got no one here to call my own
In the times feel the storm
Im a lot older than I used to be
This hard luck life has got me down
These blues will drive me out of town
I was born to ramble and born to roam
Born to leave my fathers home
Something unpleasant is about to occur
I could leave you alone if that's what you'd prefer
So come on sugar mama, take a chance with me
Im a lot older than I used to be
This hard luck life has got me down
These blues'll drive me out of town X 2You might also
