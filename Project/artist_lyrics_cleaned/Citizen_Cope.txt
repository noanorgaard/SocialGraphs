'Cause diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm tellin' you

That these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

But these feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away

It ain't easy
For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In French or in English
You might also like
'Cause diamonds, they fade (Diamonds, they fade)
And flowers, they bloom (Flowers, they bloom)
And I'm tellin' you

That these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

These feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away

Well diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm telling you
And I'm telling you
And diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom (Flowers, they bloom)
And I'm tellin' you (I'm tellin' you)
And I'm tellin' you (I'm tellin' you)
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away

But these feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away, no
These feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go
