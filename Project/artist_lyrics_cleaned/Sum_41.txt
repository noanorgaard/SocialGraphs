Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

All the streets where I walked alone
With nowhere to go have come to an end

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you don't know what you're looking to find
In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you just never know what you will find
What you will find, what you will find
What you will find, what you will find


I don't want this moment to ever end
Where everything's nothing without you

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go


Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep

'Stead of goin' under ('Stead of goin' under)
'Stead of goin' under


I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

Instead of goin' under again
Instead of goin' under, 'stead of goin' under again
'Stead of goin' under again ('Stead of goin' under 

Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' "act your age"

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me
To let you know when
Don't count on me
I'll do it again
Don't count on me
It's the point you're missin'
Don't count on me
'Cause I'm not listenin'

Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talkin' all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

(Waste my time with them)
Casualty of society
(Waste my time with them)
Victim of your conformity and back
