Always been decent kids
Time for us to grow up
Scrape knees, hearts get broken
And then sewn up
From musical influence
And liquor that we pour up
Screw the shady promoters
And the haters who told us that
We would be nothing
When we finally get this jumping
I'mma make sure I pull up in
Like a 300 and something
I ain't the type for stunting
But I love to see they faces transform
When I take the deuces turn them into aces
Age 4, I've been living lifeline on a spaceship
Always drama, inspiration, never the type to trace it
Never satisfied, my minds always else ware
Dreaming about topless women & getting healthcare
I wasn't on welfare but it was still hell there
So if you want to live good can I get a hell yeah
Ain't running from problems, I"m running to solutions
I gave this my everything so its time to recoup it
I swear
{Hook}
I've never seen the better days
The better days are yet to come
Tell me what you running from?
No one
I'm running to the lights
Running cause I'm young
Running to the city
Running cause I'm dumb
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm running … from them. (

Fuck did you want? Yeah
You spent wait too long
Looking down at me
I dreamt about everything that I'm 'bout to be, yeah
I finally feel tall, taller than you
I finally feel tall, taller than you
You might also like
I love weed rap, I ain't try see that
Its some beer pong, I just want a real song
Got me feelin tall like Shaquille with some heels on
I'll be doing this til I'm dead and the bills gone
Wait, I think it's bout time for y'all to say it
Give me my dues cause y'all know I paid it
Ten times over, sick of all you posers
Thinking you cooler than me, what the fuck, you Mike Posner
Your girl coming over, way I hit the cho cha
Drunk at the club, at home, or she sober
Nah I'm just kidding, I really respect women
But there's one thing that I don't, it's your ma' fuckin opinion
Listen up, my team get the green, we 'bout to split it up
I see all the rocks and dirt you kicking up
'Bout to hit the town, yo, try and live it up
It's a blue moon tonight, I don't really give a fuck
Don't tell me that I can't change the world
You in it for the image, yo the chains, and the girls
Sorry you've been lied to, I'm in it for survival
Oh, you the dude that told me to go and rap like Plies do

Fuck did you want? Yeah
You spent wait too long
Looking down at me
I dreamt about everything that I'm 'bout to be, yeah
I finally feel tall, taller than you
I finally feel tall, taller than you
You can't veto this, usually on emo shit
Flow sick chemo this, sipping on pinot gris
With Mindy who like indie so we fuck to Brian Eno shit
I'm like the third dick she sucked, no she ain't a skeo bitch
So close yet so far, oh lord I'm like Mozart before figarro I go hard
No odds all you hater's try to clothesline me
Know your life's over when the finally cosign me
Tell Jay, tell Ye, I could flow so grimy
I sing all my hooks yea this song so timey
I swear, when you down and out everybody kicks you
I can't even make rent, is that more of a visual
We at war you bringing them pistols
I'm more thinking missiles
Wanna put her hands on my issues
I ain't gonna lie, I got a lot to live for
Can't wait to look back, laugh we were piss poor
Trying to get more, hopefully I'll be on
Wishes apple juice will turn into Dom Perignon
That I'm sipping, I never ever give it
Cause I'm helping these kids with my writtens. I deserve a ribbon

Fuck did you want? Yeah
You spent wait too long
Looking down at me
I dreamt about everything that I'm 'bout to be, yeah
I finally feel tall, taller than you
I finally feel tall, taller than
