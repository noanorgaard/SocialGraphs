Take me back to the catacombs
I am tempted by her love
Bluest eyes against my own skin
I have never been so caught up
Looking around I see memories
What it was, oh, what it was
There in the crowd you said something
But I can't remember what

And my mother cursed the town
For closing me down

Well, living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell, I don't know
Do I care, do I care the thunder's rumbled sound?

And now I watch her
Running 'round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends

The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed
The threat of your laughter
Alive after all
Did he hear, did he hear the fumbled words you said?

Hold it in, they wouldn't let you out among the crowd
Not like that these streets will tear you down
How it is, under my skin
Now you are; pictures of all you'll ever be

Oh, I am not myself today
I am not feeling okay

Hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know, I've been trying so hard
To keep in time, with all of the sounds that you make

Hold it in they come at you from both sides of your mind
Thick and thin; these walls you'll always stand behind
I'm sick and tired, oh I begged for the world to change
But it don't, it ain't all you and that's the thing

And that's how summer passed:
The great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last
Who knew?

Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Oh, hello love
The thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love
For you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were, no

Oh hey, I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door
"Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!"

Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home, she told me that
Got a woman at home, she taught me well

Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well since times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home, she treats me well

And she's alright when everyone is wrong
She's alright, lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell

In dreams I have watched it spin
Seen the violent crack of atoms
Where all light comes in
In dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for

How can I ask, ask for more?

Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head

We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones
And as the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags

Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls

Now I am better
I implore you to say it isn't right
But somewhere deep in history
Your father pulled the teeth out of your fight
