Would you lend me a heart 
Would you lend me a soul 
Would you lend me a couple blunts, some pills, and then again I roll
Would you open a door 
Would you open a hand 
Would you open your legs so I can make you want a little more

Baby don't you know 
Some things won't never show
I will try to keep them untold
And do not try to hide oh
Make yourself at ease
Tonight we're getting high on molly
And do not try to run oh 
Cause I can take you back
Take you by the hand fly higher
Oh baby why you fussin'
No I don't want no talkin'
I just wanna be on my own

I wish I had It all
Wish I had it all
Wish I had it all
You might also like
Would you lend me a heart 
Would you lend me a soul 
Would you lend me a couple blunts, some pills, and then again I roll
Would you open a door 
Would you open a hand 
Would you open your legs so I can make you want a little more

And do not try to run oh 
Cause I can take you back
Take you by the hand fly higher
Oh baby why you fussin'
No I don't want no talkin'
I just wanna be on my own
