And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again
And I'll rise up, high like the waves
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again

For you
For you
For you
For you

When the silence isn't quiet
And it feels like it's getting hard to breathe
And I know you feel like dying
But I promise we'll take the world to its feet
And move mountains
Bring it to its feet
And move mountains
You might also like
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day
I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid
I'll rise up
And I'll do it a thousand times again

For you
For you
For you
For you

All we need, all we need is hope
And for that, we have each other
And for that, we have each other, and (We will rise)
We will rise, we will rise (We will rise)
We'll rise, oh-oh-ooh-oh (We will rise)
We'll rise

I'll rise up, rise like the day
I'll rise up in spite of the ache
I will rise a thousands times again
And we'll rise up, high like the waves
We'll rise up in spite of the ache
We'll rise up (Rise up)
And we'll do it a thousands times again
For you
For you
For you
For you
For
