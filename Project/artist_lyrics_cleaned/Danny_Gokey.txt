1 ContributorSecond Hand Heart LyricsI'm a little used up
A little tattered at the seams
But there's still enough of me to be the man you need
I'm not faultless, I guess
Got some scratches, got some dents
Yeah, I know I've got some scars on my innocence
I got a secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
What a stupid thing to do
By throwing you away
If he don't regret it yet, you know he will someday
Ooh, thank God he was blind
I thank God he let you down
For I never would have had the chance to build my world around
Your secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
And you know I've been around the block a time or two
But every step I took was leading me to you
And your secondhand heart
Yeah, it's a little banged up
But it's still beating strong enough
To give a lot of good love
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
And give it to you
I'll take my secondhand heart
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
So if you don't mind
That it's not brand new
I'll take this secondhand heart
