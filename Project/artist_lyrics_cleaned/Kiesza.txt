Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more

(Mash it)

Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh

You're sending a shiver up my spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge of letting go (Oh-oh)
But you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating off
When you get me going, I can't find a way to stop (Oh-oh)
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
You might also like
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure (Ooh, ah)
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more (Ah, ooh)
(Ooh) Oh-oh-oh (Ah, ah)
Ah-ah, hideaway with me some more (Ooh)

Bringing me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just wanna shout out, give me more
But you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Ah-ah, ah, yeah
You're a day that keeps me dreaming

(Mash it)

Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure (Ooh, ah)
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more (Ah, ooh)
(Ooh) Oh-oh-oh (Ah)
(Ah) Ah-ah, hideaway with me some more (Ooh)


So give me all the magic
And give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak, yeah

Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow...

What's the point of going through
All the pain of leaving you?
What am I supposed to do?
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you
You might also like
I'm lying to myself that I'm okay
But when I see your photograph I'm still not over you, over you
Over you, over you, oh
And every time I will your love away
It comes back in a rush reminding me
It's over now, over now
Over now, over now

So give me all the magic
Just give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak, oh-oh

Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow...

What's the point of going through
All the pain of leaving you?
What am I supposed to do?
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you
I tried my best, and I'll confess, I'll love with less
I gave the most, and took the loss, from what I chose
I fought for you, you lead me to, a painful truth
And now I wait, without a heart to save

My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
There's no escaping you...

Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow
Wow doo, doo, doo-ro, doo, dow...

Woo, woo-ooh
Oohh
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh

What's the point of going through
All the pain of leaving you?
What am I supposed to do?
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose
