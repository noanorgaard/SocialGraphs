I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby, and everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
See a ray of light, oh
See it shinin' right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me
Oh yeah

Baby, there's nothin' in this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothin' that I ever knew, hey
You might also like
And when the rain is fallin', I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
And one look at ya, baby, is all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh
I see it shinin' right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I wanna give up, I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright, hey
Everything's alright, so right


When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh
You know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh

When I see you smile
Yeah, I can face the world, oh
You know, I can do anything now
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
