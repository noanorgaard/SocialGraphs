I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time
To appear sad
With the same ol' decent lazy eye fixed to rest on you
Aim free, but so untrue

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine
Everyone's so intimately prearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine!

Lost and loaded!
Still the same ol' decent lazy eye fixed through your gaze!
That's why I said I relate!
I said we relate, it's so fun to relate!

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this 

When we crawl
Out to the brink
To meet and greet
With a wink
Pull the rug out
From underneath
This cannibal
Cannibal

Who is gonna break the ice?
No room for shallow alibis
Who will be the first to bite?
Or do we keep on playing nice
Until the next time?

Hey
It's too late
I've been here before the change
This latest phase

If the king
Bows to our feet
A cannibal's
A cannibal

Who is gonna break the ice?
No room for shallow alibis
Who will be the first to bite?
Or do we keep on playing nice
Until the next
