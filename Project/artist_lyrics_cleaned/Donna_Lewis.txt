Say it, say it again

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything (Say it, say it again), I will do for you
I love you, always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes
I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time

Say it, say it again

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything (Say it, say it again), I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and everything
Yeah, mm, yeah
