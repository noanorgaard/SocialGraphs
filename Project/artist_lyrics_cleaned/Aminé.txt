Everyday I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like
Is this what it's made of? (made of)
Money rule the world around me
That's why it's on my mind
Everyday I wake up

Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

Tender love and care, I see the money with my left eye
Rubber band man like my nickname T.I
Labels wanna sign but the money so eh
And the contract iffy so Brookah tell 'em see ya
I'm most loyal to the most loyal
You can't find dirt on me 'cause I'm not soil
I wouldn't do much for money man (yeah)
Aminé ain't Juwanna Man
Not at all, women makin' calls
Like "Aminé, do you got that paper? Let me hold it"
Mama need a whip and my daddy need a crib
Got a phone, lil nigga, why the fuck I need a Rollie?
Black pepper chicken and chow mein, my favorite
Sayin' you ain't racist really sounds racist
See money give a nigga rings
Then when you get it everybody call you fake

'Cause when it all boils down
Everything's a riddle
Everything's fickle
There's no satisfaction
There's no satisfaction
Cause when it all boils down
Everything's fickle
And little

I'm here for my range, boy, not them Rovers
Money make my world go 'round
Money make my heartbeat pounce
