Now I'm addicted to the high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

Remind me once again why I'm repeating
That we can't be more than friends
I'm just protecting myself from the possibility that you could turn me down
Thinking that I'm better off if I don't make a sound
You might also like
So I'm addicted to the high you put me on
The minute you arrive, I'm gone
But I've been mistaken, oh, you just been playing
Still I'm addicted to the same old Coldplay song
And every time you turn it on
God knows I can't fix you
But I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

I promise, I promise, I promise myself I won't see you again
Won't answer your calls, no, not at all, or read any text that you send
I promise, I promise, I promise myself this will come to an end
'Cause I can't do this again

No, I can't quit you
No, no, no
I can't quit you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
No, I can't quit you
No, I just can't quit you
Na na, na na na na na na na
I can't quit you
Na na, na na na na na na na
I can't quit you, oh
I can't quit
