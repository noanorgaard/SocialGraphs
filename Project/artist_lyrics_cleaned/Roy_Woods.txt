Make your neck red with my goatee
Don't press pause, girl, we're on repeat
Lets get high, blow it down, 6 feet
She can't love me when you know me
He can't love you when you're with me
Let me take you down, baby come and give me all
This is me now, forget about who they know
Never had a woman that had showed me love
So I never felt this feeling before
Gon' and give me some, I'm giddy for more

Girl I gave up my happiness
If it's love then I see you again
If it's not then you mess with your friends
I thought it was good 'til I came back again
Then she got a little drama with her man
Cheating on her every weekend
I get why you don't see him
But then why you can't see me
