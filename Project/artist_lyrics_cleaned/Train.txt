Don't know what I was on
But I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on going, going, gone, right through
I drove into Seattle rain
Fell in love, then missed the train
That could've took me right back home to you

I've been high, I've been low
I've been "Yes," and I've been "Oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh

Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So wrap me up, return to sender
Let's forget this five-year bender
Take me to my city by the Bay

I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
If I could wish upon a star
I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my own

I've been high, I've been low
I've been "Yes," and I've been "Oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I've been up, I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
To tell you the truth
I miss everything, everything
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
But there's a wide-eyed girl back there
And she means everything, everything

I've been stop, I've been go

Sure if she still loves me
Sure if she's still there
Will I see her light?

1 ContributorDrops Of Lucifer LyricsDrop of Lucifer
(parody of Drops of Jupiter, by Train)
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
The drop of Lucifer is severe, yeah yeah... yeah...
He acts like somehow his worldwide reign
Reminds him of his diamond days, yeah ...
Till the return of the Way and the Truth
He's livin' like a king and he talks like it too, yeah... yeah...
So tell me, are you sad you crossed the Son?
Did you fake it so the millions may believe
Your light's not faded and that Heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall like a shooting star?
One day you'll be burning in fire
I'm glad you missed me while you were booking your hotel down there
Now Christ came back with our soul salvation
Saving the day to your consternation, yeah ...
I checked out Romans, found He loves my soul
Reminds me that He's assumed control, yeah ... yeah...
Now that He's back and the coast is clear
I'm afraid that we might think of you as
A plain old angel, you're scarier than that
Though I'm not afraid to die, still the devil's pretty bad

Did you finally get the chance to glance at all the Bible says
What happened to you anyway?
And tell me, did Jesus blow your mind?
Did you ever think He wanted to die?

Your mail is piling up, I heard the weather’s rough
I know your mama’s going crazy, like always
Crying you a river like Salt Lake
Can’t wait 'til Sunday
When you land, I’ll be waiting on the runway
Flowers in my hands, tears in my eyes

'Cause I was up all night
Thinking 'bout your homemade dishes
Fantasizing all those kisses
Oh, and I was up all night
Thinking 'bout the lonely weekend
Monday, baby, we can sleep in
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Without you

Something always seems to get broken
I’ll fix it on Sunday

Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises

Mama works on carburetors
And brother is a fine mediator

Well, she wants to live her life

Oh, but that one night was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me

And I loved you every mile you drove away

There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true

Like a river made of silver
Everyone came running to the scene
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

Late that night she got away
I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones
And fell into the water
I’ll love her till my judgment day

Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems
I was shot down in cold blood

I keep falling down
I think my heart could pound right out of me
I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive

I woke up in somebody’s arms
Strange and so familiar
Where nothing could go wrong
Barely alive or nearly dead
Somehow awake in my own bed
And there you are

Like a highway headed my way
Life is but a dream
I was shot down by your love
My angel in blue

Wrapped up in a blanket of the brightest stars
