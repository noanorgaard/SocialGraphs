God damn the black night, with all its foul temptations
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside

And together there
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass
From every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer
Than anyone would ever guess

Do you remember the J.A.M.C.?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you, but I swear on my name they could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets, no

And together there
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you 

How I wish you could see the potential
The potential of you and me
It's like a book elegantly bound, but
In a language that you can't read just yet

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart

There are days when, outside your window
I see my reflection as I slowly pass
And I long for this mirrored perspective
When we'll be lovers, lovers at last

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
You might also like
I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart

You reject my advances
And desperate pleas
I won't let you let me down
So easily
So easily

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart

I will possess your heart
I will possess your

When there's a burning in your heart
An endless yearning in your heart
Build it bigger than the Sun
Let it grow
Let it grow
When there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed
(This... Fire... Grows... Higher...)
When there's a doubt within your mind
'Cause you're thinkin' all the time
Framing rights into wrongs
Move along
Move along
When there's a doubt within your mind
When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Oh, there's nothing to fear
Save the tears
Save the tears
When there's a burning in your heart

Then it's time to go
And you find your destination with so many different places to call home
'Cause when you find yourself a villain
In the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions
Are in need of redemptions
Would you agree
If so, please show me

When there's a burning in your heart
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... Higher...)

'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place where
They're far more suited than here

Ba-da ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh, what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate "half empty or half full?"
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown
Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms
You might also like
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
