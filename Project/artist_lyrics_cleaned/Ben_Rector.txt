I feel like new sunglasses
Like a brand-new pair of jeans
I feel like takin' chances
I feel a lot like seventeen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, Oh-ohhh
Oh-oh, Oh-ohhh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
I feel like windows rolled down
New city, streets, and cabs
I feel like anything can happen
Laughin', you take me right back
To when we were kids
Never thought I'd feel like this

Like when I close my eyes
And don't even care if anyone sees me dancin'
Like I can fly
And I don't even think I'm touchin' the ground
Like a heartbeat skip
Like an open page
Like a one-way trip on an aeroplane
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Brand new

Like makin' big mistakes

Can't feel no pain when your feet start movin'
Just let loose and you'll feel alright

Hey baby, throw your cares away
(Let the good times roll, ooh)
Leave your worry for another day
(Let the good times roll, ooh)
Leave your yesterday behind
Let the good times roll tonight

Everybody's got their troubles
Everybody's been alone
There's nobody here that could make it on their own
When your worries all around you
Got you bad and you can't sleep
Listen, baby, and I'll tell you what you need
