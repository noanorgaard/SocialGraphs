I could sing before I could speak
And as a child in my heart, I knew what I wanted to be
The moment that I touched the keys
It blew my mind, and I find that nothing else can compete

The first time that I played those strings
Took me away to another place, nothing could ever hurt me
Walking out onto the stage
It was a world that I found and I never want to give away

Take me on a ride of a lifetime
All the memories I hope to find
Bring to me to the sky
In the summertime, through blue and white
Where I can fly
Take me by surprise
Bring me to the stars
To galaxies so far from ours
Set my spirit free
In music is where I will be

You, you, you, you have a dream
I hope to find-
You, you, you have a dream (dream, dream)
They opened my-
You, you, you, you, you (dream, dream, dream)
You, you, you have a dream (dream, dream, dream, dream)
You have a, you have a (dream)
I hope to find-
You have a, you, you have a (dream)
They opened my-
You, you, you, you, you (dream, dream, dream)
You, you, you have a dream (dream, dream, dream, dream)
Take me on a ride of a lifetime
All the memories I hope to find
Bring to me to the sky
In the summertime, through blue and white
Where I can fly
Take me by surprise
Bring me to the stars
To galaxies so far from ours
Set my spirit free
In music is where I will be
