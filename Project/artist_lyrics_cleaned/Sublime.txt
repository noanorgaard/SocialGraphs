We took this trip to Garden Grove
It smelt like Lou Dog inside the van, oh yeah
This ain't no funky reggae party, five dollars at the door
It gets so real sometime, who wrote my rhyme?
I've got the microwave, got the VCR
I got the deuce-deuce in the trunk of my car, oh yeah
If you only knew all the love that I've found
It's hard to keep my soul on the ground

You're a fool
Don't fuck around with my dog
All that I can see, I steal; I fill up my garage
'Cause in my mind
Music from Jamaica, all the love that I found
Pull over, there's a reason why my soul's unsound

It's you
It's that shit stuck under my shoe
It's that smell inside the van
It's my bed sheet covered with sand
Sittin' through a shitty band
Gettin' dog shit on my hands
Gettin' hassled by the man
Wakin' up to an alarm
Stickin' needles in your arm
Pickin' up trash on the freeway
Feelin' depressed every day
Leaving without making a sound
Pickin' my dog up at the pound
Livin' in a tweeker pad
Gettin' yelled at by my dad
Sayin' I'm happy when I'm not
Findin' roaches in the pot
All these things I do
They're waiting for you

Daddy, he once told me, "Son, you be hard workin' man"
And Momma, she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can"
But then one day, I met a man who came to me and said:
"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head"

Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Rock me tonight, for old time's sake, ohYou might also 

I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup and never wan' give

A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can, it's the wrong way

The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me

Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight, it was the wrong way

Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup an' never wan' give

So, we ran away and I'm sorry when I say
That straight to this very day it was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way

I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan'

If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid"

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said, "Now, baby, don't be sad
In my opinion, you weren't half-bad"
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on, party people, won't you listen to me?
Date rape stylee
The next day, she went to her drawer
Looked up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge
He screamed, "She lies, that little slut!"
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
And now his heart is filled with tears
One night in jail, it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story
It does not pay to be drunk and horny

But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
That's the way it had to be

April 26th, 1992
There was a riot on the streets, tell me, where were you?
You were sitting home watching your TV
While I was participatin' in some anarchy
The first spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashing, time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally, we got our own P.A
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?
Hey!

'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder, and harder and harder, each and every year
Some kids went in and stole with their mother
I saw her when she came out, she was getting some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the Mexican, and not for the white man
But if you look at the street, it wasn't about Rodney King
And this fucked up situation, and these fucked up police
It's about coming up and stayin' on top
And screamin', "187 on a motherfuckin' cop"
It's not in the paper, it's on the wall

As I was walking down rubadub square
Not a chill to the weather but a nip to the air
From another direction she was caught in my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away, she was not like other girls

Because the woman took the lovin' over me
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
Because I sold up all my personal property

We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea
We sold some ecstasy
We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP
