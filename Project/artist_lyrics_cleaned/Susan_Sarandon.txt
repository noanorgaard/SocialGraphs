It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frankie fan
But it was over when he had the plan
To start working on a muscle man
Now the only thing that gives me hope
Is my love of a certain dope
Rose tints my world
Keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

I am just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmic rush of lust
Rose tints my world
And keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy
I'll be good, you'll see
Take this dream away
What this, let's see
I feel sexy
What's come over me?
Woo! Here it comes again
You might also like
I feel released
Bad times deceased
My confidence has increased
Reality is here
The game has been disbanded
My mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frankie's landed
His lust is so sincere...
FANFARE

Whatever happened to Fay Wray?
That delicate satin draped frame
As it clung to her thigh
How I started to cry
Cause I wanted to be dressed just the same

Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams to treasure forever
Can't you just see it...
DON'T DREAM IT

Don't dream it, be it (x12)
Ach! We've got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our will.  I've got to be strong and try to hang on, or my mind may well snap und my life will be lived for the thrills

It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy

God bless Lily St. Cyr...
WILD AND UNTAMED THING

My my my

I'm a wild and an untamed thing
I'm a bee with a deadly sting
You get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll pump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it 'till the life has gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
You get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll pump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it 'till the life has gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting

Your heart'll pump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it 'till the life has gone, gone, gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

Frank-N-Furter, it's all over
Your mission is a failure
Your lifestyle's too extreme
I'm your new commander
You now are my prisoner
We return to Transylvania
Prepare the transit 

You mean sh—?

Uh-huh

I thought there's no use getting
Into heavy petting
It only leads to trouble and
Seat wetting
Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more

More, more, more

I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
I need assistance

I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

Then if anything grows
While you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down

Down, down, down

And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand
And I need action
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night

Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty

Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me

Creature of the night

Oh
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
