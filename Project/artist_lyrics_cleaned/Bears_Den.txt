But you've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
You keep begging for forgiveness
But you don't think you've done wrong
You've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
My pleading hands, your shaking head

And as your love starts to surround you
All of their words are trying to drown you
When you break, it's too late for you to fall apart
And the blame that you claim is all your own fault

But you've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
You keep begging for forgiveness
But you don't think you've done wrong
You've been crying now for forever
But forever's come and gone
My pleading hands, your shaking head

So tell me another beautiful lie
Tell me everything I want to hear
Won't you lay here by my side?
I want to fuck away all my fear
Tell me another beautiful lie
Tell me everything I want to hear
Won't you lay here by my side?
I want to fuck away all my fear
Tell me another beautiful lie
Tell me everything I want to hear
Won't you lay here by my side?
I want to fuck away all my fear
Tell me another beautiful lie
Tell me everything I want to hear
Won't you lay here by my side?
I want to fuck away all my fear

And I have seen all that you have seen
And I have been where you have been
No, our hands will never be clean
At least we can hold each 

You took me walking through the town
Showed me the statues underground
Said, "Just don't they look at peace?
Sometimes I wish that was me"
I was the son you always had
Tugging at your coat while you were sad
I was the son you always had
I was the son you always had

Don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to
Please just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to

You said, "Stay in the car and wait
There's just some things I have to say"
Don't you know I miss her, too?
I miss her just as much as you
So, my father and my son
As you end what she's begun
You'll lie patient by her side
With roses red come lilies white

I was too young to understand
The flowers slipping from your hands
I was too young to understand
I was too young to understand
I was too young to understand
The flowers sleeping in her hands
I was too young to understand
I was too young to understand

Don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to
Please just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to
And just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you to
Please just don't cry
Hold your head up high
She would want you to
She would want you 

And I can't forgive myself
Oh, I can't forgive myself

You would hide yourself in a shroud as your hair started falling out
When you took off your dressing gown, Sophie
Your mother was dressed in black with a lock of your hair in her hands
And I knew there was no turning back, Sophie

And I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
I can't forgive myself
No, I can't forgive myself
Sophie, Sophie

Didn't know when I started running, I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running, I'd be running my whole life
Didn't know when I started running, I was running for my life
Didn't know when I started running, I'd be running my whole life
I didn't know when I started running, I was running for my life
