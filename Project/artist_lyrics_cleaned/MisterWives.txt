My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt

Bought my first keys at fifteen
Not for a car, play my songs at every shitty dive bar
Big dreams in the biggest city
She don't care if you ever make it far
Mama said, "Don't ever lose sight
Stay true to your voice inside"

Not very pretty, but tough as stone

But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough

Learn to shake the demons off

We built our own house, own house
With our hands over our hearts
And we swore, on that day
That it'll never fall apart

We'll never fall apart

Wake up to the sun
Clouds always come undone
You give the light I need
Like water to a seed
Read it in a tale
One too tall to be real
And proved me wrong, it seems
A heart can truly gleam

We'll never fall apart

With our hands over our hearts

Take it all, take it away
We'll still have this undying
Love that is beating
'Til our lungs stop breathing
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our riches
No need for stitches
'Cause love mends the pain
Take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away (love mends the pain)
So take it all, take it away

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

Our eyes were closed with hearts open wide
Dismissed every rule to abide by
Our bodies undressed the layers of shy
Revealing the truth that was buried inside
Filled up of feelings
That now are bursting at the seams

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you
You, you, you

Unsure of what are my dreams, it seems
You've stolen my slumber and awakened another
Life within me that is better than any other
Reaching endless heights in never-ending nights
That can't be seen, put to bed this dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Put me on the shelf, discipline myself
To let the sparks die out
Shattering anything
That has reflections of you

We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never...
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
And she don't clap the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days? Don't you miss the danger?

Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
Oh, don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the lines, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the lines, stay in the line


Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you
Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you

Open my eyes
To see you and I
Can't believe this is life
We're coloring outside the lines
Open my eyes
A saturated sunrise
Doesn't seem as bright
When we're coloring outside the lines
(Coloring, coloring, coloring)

They say time slips away when you're having fun
That's why you said, "Let's change our life to a dull one"
Don't wanna blink one day and this will all be over
If only time could stop so we'd never grow older
Yet in the same breath, I look forward to the day
When our skin has aged, I'll love you just the same
Our canvas will have endless hues and shades
Because of all the vivid colors that we made, oh

Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come

No matter the day
No matter the night
Our love will keep burnin'
Keep burning bright
No matter the low
No matter the high
My darling, our love will
Will never run dry

Pick apart every piece of me
And miss the point entirely
I only did this to be sane
Not for you to know my name
Go 'head and spit the music out
Please tell me more about your doubt
Don't fear, I've heard it all before
Each time makes it easier to ignore

Oh, I am tired of abiding by your rules
Causing me to second-guess my every single move
You don't know who I am or what I have been through, no
So don't dare tell me what I should and shouldn't do 'cause

Not here to lose
Not here for you to choose
How we should be
'Cause we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine, no

Don't feel like having a computer sing this phrase
Not looking for a hired name to write a song for me that sounds the same

Told to look and act a way as if I'm just a ball of clay
That you can mold into whatever, I assure you that's not clever
See, now fads don't last forever, they are fleeting like the weather
And we will stand our ground while you will sink and drown
Ha ha ha ha ha!
'Cause I'm a tough girl, I run my own world
And if you don't like it, there's the door
If you haven't heard, I ain't got no interest in your business
Just here for the music and there's nothing else to this bullshit
Woah-oh-oh-oh, 'cause
