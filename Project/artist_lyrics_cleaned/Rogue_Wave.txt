Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack

Now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms
Sky is burnin', but at least we know we're warm
Go and run yourself a million miles
Hoping that the colors run out

And you go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack

You can never see yourself ringin' all around it
You can never see yourself ringin' all around it
You can never see yourself ringin' all around it
You can never see yourself ringin' all around it
You can never see yourself ringin' all around it
No one, no one
Michigan
You labored, you labored
Michigan
You might also like
Not another payoff
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack
You know you can do
Get off of my stack, stack

Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan (You can never see yourself ringin' all around it)
Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan (You can never see yourself ringin' all around
