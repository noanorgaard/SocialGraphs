Don't go home let's talk a little longer
Different places thinking of each other
I keep hoping I might find my way to you
Darling, I'm sure you're not alone
And it's nice to get attention
Called your phone so they won't see the mentions
Let me know if you're looking for a different view
Different view, and if you stay

(Up all night) while I'm here won't you come through
(How can I) make it clear that I want you
I got all this time and you got nothing better to do
You got nothing better to do

I know you lovе to live without hesitation
Always looking for the nеxt spot
Invitation to a ted talk, Herbie Hancock
You're so delighted by the same situation
I just wanna be a quick pop
That you think of at your desk job
You might also like
So if you like it (I like it)
And you with it (I'm with it)
If you ready (I'm ready)
Come and get it
Oooh stop pretending, baby
Like you got nothing better to do

(Up all night) while I'm here won't you come through
(How can I) make it clear that I want you
I got all this time and you got nothing better to do
You got nothing better to do
(Up all night) while I'm here won't you come through
(How can I) make it clear that I want you
I got all this time and you got nothing better to do
You got nothing better to do

So if you like it (I like it)
And you with it (I'm with it)
If you ready (I'm ready)
Come and get it
Oooh stop pretending (I like it)
And you with it (I'm with it)
If you ready (I'm ready)
Come and get it
Oooh stop pretending (I like it)
And you with it (I'm with it)
If you ready (I'm ready)
Come and get it
Oooh stop pretending (I like it)
And you with it (I'm with it)
If you ready (I'm ready)
Come and get it
Oooh stop
