Sex dreams, touching skin, breathe, just need
That thing that you do, when you move through my head
In my bed you're so bad, I go mad
Just thinking 'bout you
Just thinking 'bout, just thinking 'bout you
No more conversation
Nights all alone, being wasted
When we could go, go places
Cause you belong here with me
Know what I want, and what could be

You've got that kind of love that I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love that I've been dreaming of
I know what I see, and you're incredible
You've got what I need and I can't let you go
You've got that kind of love that I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love that I've been dreaming of

Cold sweat, tight dress, so stressed, obsessed
Just wanna be right where you are, in the dark
With your skin on my skin, I'm all in
Just thinking 'bout you
Just thinkin' bout, just thinkin' bout you
No more conversation

You've got that kind of love that I've been dreaming of
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love
You've got that kind of love

I want that long night, long times all the time
You want that long love, close touch right now
Let's keep it high heat, no sleep all the time
Just want to keep up, hold off this now

You said you don't want to talk about it
But I knew every word that I just said
By now I'm supposed to know this wrong, but
I can't seem to slow down in my head

In my head

Silhouette of what I needed
Nothing left but I can feel it

I want that long night, long times all the time
You want that long love, close touch right now
