Tell me you're mine, baby
Tell me before I erupt
Burn up in the sky, baby
Become the dust

I can see no use in it
Ignoring your burning heart just to calm mine
It's such a waste of your time
But to love you takes every waking thought
I have when daylight comes
To relieve the night

Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise
You might also like
Forget me, you're fire, baby
Leave me 'til I am distilled
And clean as the water, baby
And pour it over my fears, my fears

I can see no use in it
Ignoring your heaving chest when you cry
It can't be good for your heart
If loving me means every tear you lay
Will burn your skin
As it leaves your eye

Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher
Too far for you to touch
Too hard is never too much
Let your flames rise
Let your flames
Give me your fire
Give me reasons to learn
Give me every excuse to burn
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher
Too far for you to touch
Too hard is never too much
Let your flames rise
Let your flames rise higher
I can feel the darkness in me
No monster only a disaster waiting to be
Set fire to and set free
From my anatomy
But I can feel the warmth from your heart
To fight a fire with fire will make the darkness depart
So come a little closer and mend my malady
I can feel the darkness in me
No monster only a disaster waiting to be
Set fire to and set free
From my anatomy
But I can feel the warmth from your heart
To fight a fire with fire will make the darkness depart
So come a little closer and mend my malady

Give me your fire (I can feel the darkness in me)
Give me reasons to learn (No monster only a disaster waiting to be)

Let every picture paint a thousand words

I've been trying to give you my love
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to give you some space
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to save you the trouble
But you won't let me, won't let me
I've been trying to give you my love

Don't feed the solace within you
And allow it to grow
Cause when the leaves, the blossom become you
They'll turn black and they'll fall
I promise you if you're gonna lock me out
I will stand as your ghost
If you take the love you're given
I will leave you alone
I will leave you alone
I will leave you alone

Pick apart the pieces you left
Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
Try and give yourself some rest
And let me worry about it, let me worry about it
You came around to say that you’ve been away, like I hadn’t known
As if I don’t wake up every single day not seeing you go
As if this moon of ours only shines a half to make me feel whole
As if I haven’t felt your breath in every step I take when the wind blows

Pick apart the pieces you left
Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
Try and give yourself some rest
And let me worry about it, let me worry about it

Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself

Lover, if you only knew
The times that train has fooled me too
And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can surprise yourself
So let go and surprise yourselfYou might also 

And no wonder I keep you close
You're the water to quench my throat
And if I never let you go
Will you keep me young
Keep me young

When I grow old, my weathered soul
And memories recluse, elusive
Help me take them out
So keep me young and call my bluffs
And help me out when you say, you say
There's no room for doubt

Say I'm stronger and keep me close
And be the water and test my cold
And if I never let you go
Will you keep me young
