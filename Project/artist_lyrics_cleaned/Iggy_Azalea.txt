Everywhere I go, they say it's Iggy Season
'Til I get what I want, baby, I ain't leavin'
Everytime I go out, everybody wanna show out
I just see a girl in the mirror, told her: "you the reason"
Simmer down, bitch, it's Iggy Season
Simmer down, bitch, it's Iggy Season
I ain't worried 'bout shit, it's Iggy Season
Bad bitches scream yas, it's Iggy Season

Every man needs some Azalea
You want it, you do what I tell ya
You play on my team and get a ring back
You don't, you gon' end up a failure
I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me
Just 'cause hubby is a fan of me, you understandin' me? Hmm
So skip the talkin', baby, we too busy ballin', baby
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stallin', baby
Bitches gon' hate, while the critics critique
I pay them no mind whenever they speak
What they make a year, I can make in a week
I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat
See the sky be the limit when you dealin' with me
I'm stuntin' this hard, and I ain't even reached my peak
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat
I'm feelin' like I got this world on my feet, hmm, Iggz

Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah, I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, ow!
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that (Ooh)
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that (Ooh)
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
It's so good, he just wishing he could bite it, huh? (Say what?)
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me, honey (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it, 'til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind and it's nothin' but me
On it (On it, on it), now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want (Shh)
You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy (Oh)
You should've known better
Than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Bla-bla-bla-black widow, 

Pulled up lookin' picture perfect, baby
High price (Ooh), but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy, groundbreakin' what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous (Shake, shake)
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killin' 'em on purpose
I-G-G-Y, did she just have to do it?
Baby, ride with me, fly livin', ain't nothin' to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Get my bake on, cake long, that's automatic

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Pussy power, pay me by the hour (Right)
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers (Ah)
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours (Right)
All yellow gold on me like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wonderin' where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feelin' back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feelin' that
Now Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me (Ayy)
See, I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talkin' all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
Oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh), oh-eh-oh, oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh)
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
Oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh), oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh)

Got you hooked, boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it
You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for
