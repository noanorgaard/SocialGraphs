Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa oh-oh-oh

I'm the dreamer
Soaking up every line
Searching for truth all the time
Oh, yeah, I'm the believer
That music can save us all
The one who's at every show
In the front row, singing
You might also like
Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
All the drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa oh-oh-oh

I'm the singer
Pouring out all that I have
Every love song and heartbreak gone bad
And looking back
When I was younger
Sitting right there where you are
Sending a prayer to the highest star
And here we are
Oh, here we are

Oh, easy come, easy go
Yeah, we rock, then we roll out of town
But for now, while the moment is here
Shine a light, drink a beer, let's get loud
The drivers and dreamers
Believers and singers
Oh, won't you sing with me now?
Oh-whoa
