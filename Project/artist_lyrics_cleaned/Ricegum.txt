Ayy, didn't see 'em, like George, I'm just curious
Ayy, Alissa said you cum fast, like the Furious

Wanna flex on my wrist, I put some ice on it

Talk shit, now I'm on your head like some lice on it
Heard you used to bully kids back in high school (Ooh)
Second part for the kill, that's what Rice do (Ooh)

You ain't got no bars, no flow like a lake do (Shit)
Rented cars and that Rollie lookin' fake too
Let's go back to the bully thing, listen here
Was it back in middle school or was it senior year? (What?)
Didn't think you'd get caught like an interference
Pick on others just to hide the fact you were insecure
How you think they felt when they went home and they were dripping tears? (Ooh)
You cheated on a good girl, Tessa's hideous
And then you went and got a big head like you Phineas
