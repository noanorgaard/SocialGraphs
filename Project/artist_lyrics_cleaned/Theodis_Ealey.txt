All you wannabe lovers
There's something you need to know
Now this old lady told me a story a long time ago
She said, "Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, boy, they really don't"
She said, "I had a man who thought he was the world's greatest lover
But when you add his time up, he was just a five-minute brother"
He used to lick it, mm, he used to stroke it
You know, one night, we was makin' love, he said
That thang is so damn good, I wanna put it in my pipe and smoke it

She said, "Theodis, you need to know
That you can lick it and you can stroke it
Now you can kiss it and you can eat it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Mm, got to stand up in it

Now this wannabe brother who thought he was the world's greatest lover
Stopped by my house the other day and caught me with my part-time lover
He said, "Baby, ooh, baby, why you messin' around on me?
I make sure your rent's paid, I make sure your cable's on
Now, just the other day, I bought you a cell phone
Baby, ooh, baby, why you do me this way?"
She said, "Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, boy, they really don't"

Now you can lick it, and you can stroke it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Now you can eat it, and you can lick it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Oh, you got to stand up in it, boy
Ooh, you got to stand up in it, yes, you do

Yeah, she said
"Now, Theodis, play that guitar for me like you're standing up in it"
I said, "Alright," I went
She said, "No, no, no, no, go'n, go'n
Play it like you're sta— you know, stand up in it
What? What? What? What? Stand on up on it"
I say, I said, "Okay then, alright then," I, I said
Oh yeah, Theodis
She said, "Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is, son, they really don't"
She said
You can lick it, mm, you can stroke it
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it, ooh
Now you can eat it, boy, and you can lick it, hey
But you ain't did a dog-gone thing until you stand up in it
Ooh, boy, you better stand up in it

Yeah, oh, oh
You got to stand on up in it, you know
Somebody said, you know, a woman got to have
Ooh, don't you know? She got to feel it, boy, every time
That what old Bobby Womack said, fellas, I'ma tell you somethin' now, he was right too
And
And the moral of this story is, is that
You can eat it, stroke it, lick it
Do anything you wanna do with it
But you ain't did nothing until you stand up in it
