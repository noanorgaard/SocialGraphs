Yeah, I sold my soul to pay the rent
I savour this, but I still regret
I stay the kid, who never left
I'm leaving this, or better yet
Kill myself at 27
Reject the gates, when I get to heaven
Coz what's popular is overrated
So if I blow up, I'll need sedating
Call me up with your requests
I might say yes, that's unrelated
I give up when I'm at my best
I'm over this, let me reinstate it
What furthered me left me degraded
A picture perfect purgatory, so murder me
I'm hurting please, so murder me
I'm feeling jaded

I lost myself in the hills on my way down
I been thinking if I drink than I will surely drown
Meet me in the carpark, I'll stand there while you take me down
I won't even throw a punch, I'll take it from the damn ground
Lost myself in the hills on my way drown
I been thinking if I drink then I will surely drown
Thinking on my past, thinking on my hometown
If I don't spit the image then
I could lose the whole crown

(I know that you think of me
Every time you scroll down
I know that you think of me
Every time you scroll down
Maybe you'll write a song about me, and
Never put it out
Maybe I'll write a song about you, and then
I'll hear about it)

I gave up tryna be your favourite
Coz I played my cards and you hated it
Coz I played an 8, but you wanted 10
But I always jumped if you said when
And I'm still a kid, like my name is Drest
That kid's on fire, I'm calling it
She calls me Sage when I'm on stage, until I say I'm bored of this
I hope he gets that, I don't pretend rap
I just reflect shit, that you forget rap
About the small things, like whoever said that
Blink-182 shit, I might suggest that
It's a fakes smile like that weird cat
It's a crazy land, like what Alice had
I hate this town and what it's about and
You can bet I'm not coming back

(Used to listen to Startup Cult
In the back of my dad's commodore
I used to be wanna be Tom so much
I kinda forgot who Aidan was
I forgot what day it was
The lines are getting hazy coz
I guess when you rhyme so much
The nights they fade like promises)

Lost myself in the hills on my way drown
I been thinking if I drink then I will surely drown
Thinking on my past, thinking on my hometown
If I don't spit the image then
I could lose the whole
