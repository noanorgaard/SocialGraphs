If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off of turning 'em bass
Never worry 'bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

I get a little Farm Pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke, Mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat, and she's ready to go

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures

Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle

You shake your little pom poms up in the stands

Watch the sunset disappear

But then again, it ain't

How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss

We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
