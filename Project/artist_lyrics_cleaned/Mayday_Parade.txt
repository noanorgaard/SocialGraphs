Hold onto me, hold onto me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know I've got my problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

Stayed up too late and it hurts to breathe
Said it's 4 A.M., girl, go back to sleep
Sometimes at night, I can hear her dreams
Come rescue me, come rescue me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know we got our problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I'm a drifter's body in an open sea
And I've seen my reflection staring right back at me
With no place to go and you're left all alone
There's no place like home

Hold onto me, hold onto me
Just stay with me, just stay with me
I know we got our problems and you'll probably leave
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I could never leave, I will never leave
So hold onto me, hold on to 

You're like a black cat
With a black backpack full of fireworks
And you're gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa whoa
You're like a black cat

And you're gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa whoa

Oh close up camera two
'Cause the hero dies in this scene
Your inspiration is the loss of absolutely everything
And flashback on the girl
As we montage every memory
And we bleed out in the bathroom sink
And we fade out as the soundtrack sings:

She said, "Get your hands off of my star."
It's not your part but all your fault
And this jealous actress has a habit
Of making things sound way too tragic

Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

So sleep alone tonight, with no one here just by your side
Sleep alone tonight
How does he feel, how does he kiss?
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips?

Let's write a song that we can dance to
Cause they all wanna listen
Just to know how it sounds when
I do that thing you know that I do
When I find inspiration
This is me breaking down when

Cause Jersey just got colder and
I'll have you know I'm scared to death
That everything that you had said to me was just
A lie until you left
Now I'm hoping just a little bit stronger
Hold me up just a little bit longer
I'll be fine, I swear
I'm just gone beyond repair

Let's write a song that we can sing to
And you can lead the choir
And put the hook where it hurts most
And you threw a spark that lit the candle
That set us all on fire
And sent a flame down the East Coast

I'll have you know I'm scared to death
That everything that you had said to me was just

Now I'm hoping just a little bit stronger
Hold me up just a little bit longer

I'm just gone beyond repair

And I should have been your everything
I'm now at the end of my eternity
And I fall asleep to have the darkest dreams
Cause this just won't seem right to me
I close my eyes and beg for peace

Jersey just got colder and...

She says she'll run until her feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out
We'll keep listening she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret you can keep, keep me

Cuts on paper hearts they can be awful deep
Rips from wear and tear on different city streets
They don't all need a home but just a place to sleep

So I will run until my feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out
We'll keep listening she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night
And she'll be a secret you can keep, keep me

And soon she'll find that every time she runs she leaves behind
Another piece of her on every city street

And as the waves carry me out
We'll keep listening she'll never make a sound

So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like a ghost that keeps you up all night

She says she's headed west to make it right for one more night and
Well I don't blame her if she is
But he thinks it's just one more sunset
And after all, it's her fault If she hasn't caught on yet

So why'd you have to go?
Is there something I could say to make you turn around?
Cause nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there?
Can anybody help to get me out of here?
Cause you're walking down a road that I can't go

And I, all that I wanted was to walk you home

And she thinks she'll be my tourniquet
As the record on my stereo plays her favorite song for two whole days
And the drag stretched out for miles and miles
And what she'd give for one more smile
And how she hoped he missed her
Cause, God, she missed how he would kiss her
