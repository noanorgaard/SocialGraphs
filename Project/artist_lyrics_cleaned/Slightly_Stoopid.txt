Said, if you want to get with me
Girl, this is what you'll find
But a man who's got the type of moves to make you lose your mind
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
You tell me that you've got that type of lovin' here to stay
Sweet honey

You see me laughin' cause it's kinda funny to me
The way she say she never give her lovin' for free
She say she got a man, why she lookin' at me?
Yes, she want a lover with the sensitivity, ya
But won't you tell me that your love's from the heart?
Yes, the type of lovin' that can tear mine apart
Girl, you got to realize before it ever starts
Yes, I am the man who won't come breakin' your heart

Let's take a plane up out to Philly
We flying outta Dallas
Somewhere countin' a milli
Used to land on an empty chalice
Every land, we gon' play
An' I getting the weed from Cali
And rolling it up in Philly
Smoking weed up all day
We never seem to complain, really
And I really need to hear it
It a Kryptonite and don't you know
And we would not get near
No ordinary sensimilla
And the only thing they wanted
When the kryptonite is gone
We started smoking supersonic
If you got money to pay
Better put your money on it
Vibration that go on and on and on and on
And a sight you never believe
What I'm smoking is 'semillia
No explanation needed
When I'm high, I don't conceal it
Everything is okay

This joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

Smoked up all my weed from Philly
And everything from Cali
I'm all up in them palm trees
Smoking a pound of Maui-Wowie
Pakalolo, grade A
We go to the Caribbean
Deliver it up by the sea
Ya know connections get paid
Different strap for every season
If you really need a reason
We'd like the Kryptonite and an open red bull, lightin' b's
More than ounce or two of chronic
In the end it's what we needed
No artificial type, pretender cut
Oh no, man, we'd say, "come and let the music play"
Full volume, and repeat it
Vibration that go on and on and on and on
From here or Minnesota
From there onto Daytona
We came up in New York
Now up in Cali, so pro bono
Everything is okay
