Gimme all you got, babe
Gimme all your love

'Cause I remember them days
I waited so patiently
For God to bring someone
Who's gonna be good to me
And then he blessed my soul

Well, I traveled a long way (I traveled a long, long way)
And it took a long time (It took a long time)
To find you
But I finally found you

I remember all them lonely days
I traveled out on my own
Then you brought me everything
And you made my house a home
But if it's not the real deal
Then I don't know it
'Cause it sure does feel
And I think it sure does show
