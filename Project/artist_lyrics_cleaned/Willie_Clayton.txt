The people there will tell you - ask any passerby
About the kid who speaks in gibberish - folks’ll tell you, “Shoot...
Wasn’t nothing but a little love and attention gave voice to a mute”
Who stood with his transistor - pressed against his ear
Picking up certain frequencies that only he could hear
There was this little man inside it - perhaps his only friend

They give Radio report cards & they give him varsity letters
They let him wander freely in his TL Hanna sweater
He visits all the classrooms - and whenever there’s a test
He whips out his box of crayons - he tries his very best
Everyone knows Radio - the townspeople adore him
The students pat his head just like their parents did before them
Anderson, South Carolina...folks’ll tell you, “Shoot...
