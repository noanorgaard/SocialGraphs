So watch me turn it up like this
Make it loud 'til I feel it rumble like this
Boom, boom, you better make my heartbeat skip
Won't stop until I make history
I wanna live young, die free, free, free
Live young, die free, free, free
And if you wanna be, be, be
With somebody like me
Well, we could live young, die free

I'm so sick and tired of being the one who plays it safe
Ready to start it up and make it my show
You can't be with me if you move slow
I want it now, is it so far?
I don't wanna have to wait
I like the rush, need to feel it on my skin
If it's good, then do it again, yeah

So watch me turn it up like this
Make it loud 'til I feel it rumble like this
Boom, boom, you better make my heartbeat skip
Won't stop until I make history
I wanna live young, die free, free, free
I wanna live young, die free, free, free
And if you wanna be, be, be
With somebody like me
Well, we could live young, die free

I'll stay here with no regrets
Don't tell me what I want
And if I'm gonna bet, I'm gonna bet it all
Don't need your diamond rings
'Cause I can do anything
We should do everything

So watch me turn it up like this
Make it loud 'til I feel it rumble like this
Boom. boom, you better make my heartbeat skip
Won't stop until I make history
I wanna live young, die free, free, free
I wanna live young, die free, free, free
And if you wanna be, be, be
With somebody like me
Well, we could live young, die free, free, free
Free, free, free
And if you wanna be, be, be
With somebody like me
Well, we could live young, die free, free, free
Oh, we could live young, die free, free, free
And if you wanna be, be, be
With somebody like me
Oh, we could live young, die free, free, free
Free, free,
