Swear to God, double knot
What would you do if I stole you tonight? (Ah ah)
Why waste time? (Ah ah)

'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I belong in your arms
I belong in your arms

Feelings are good, nothing to say
Just want my head on your shoulder
Banana split, honestly
You're my remote controller, ah ah

Between you and me, suddenly
Something, something, something
Is on my mind

(Ay)
Woo!

'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I belong in your arms
I belong in your arms

I belong

This is rump-shaker music, jump up, pump, faker music
Superstar stunt maker music
Sun breaker music and God gave her all of that ass
Wait a minute, hold up, make 'em lose it
It's safe to assume that it's great making cash off of this
Even better, making cash off of hits
So excuse me if I ball out when it's bank time
For spending, I'mma make time, checking on them blank lines
Dollar, dollar, dollar, but that ain't gon' feed us
A hundred million money bags, there ain't no reason
On why we worship hundreds, like, they ain't no Jesus
But I've been putting work in, it's a green back season
I need my bank rolls and the stacks thick
Piling up my bills to spend it all, it's just practice
Sometimes you try to do it all for the cactus
Got return for my taxes and I splurge like a bachelor

Getting what you want can be dangerous (uh-oh)
But that's the only way I want it to be
I double dare you to keep a secret (uh-oh)
And pass it back under the table to me
I put the stash in the bookshelf (uh-oh)
Open your mouth and I'll slip you the key
Now crack that combination (uh-oh)
Like 27-99-23

Do me the biggest favor, don't you need no favors
I got my own club, got my own paper
Back when I had nothing, you would get me down
When I was on the road grinding, you would sleep around
Now wake your ass up to the reality
That I done came up, way up, I know you mad at me
You would be happy if I ain't have all of this cash with me
Even happier if I jumped off the balcony
But if I ever jumped, it's with a set of wings
Somewhere in the sky because you let me free
Free from all the hate and you can't buy my love
You can try to sabotage, but baby, try your luck
And this here ain't luck, this is destiny
And hard work and right answers when he texting me
100 'til the day that I leave
Road running, getting money, ch-ching, yeah

I tried to do handstands for you
I tried to do headstands for you
Every time I fell on you, yeah, every time I fell
I tried to do handstands for you
But every time I fell for you
I'm permanently black and blue, permanently blue

For you-ooh
For you-ooh
So black and blue-ooh

I grabbed some frozen strawberries
So I could ice your bruising knees
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like
All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruising knees
Hot July ain't good to me
I'm pink and black and blue (For you)

Forget forgiveness, forget all the rules
Just please don't do it here
Bring on the fire, 'cause business is cruel
And Sophie's got somewhere to be

I'm not afraid, so take me outside
I know what you're here to do
Shotgun up familiar sleeves
Undercover but nobody's fooled, no
Got no time, no time for goodbyes
Oh God, just let my love survive

Forget forgiveness, forget all the rules
Just please don't do it here (Don't do it here)
