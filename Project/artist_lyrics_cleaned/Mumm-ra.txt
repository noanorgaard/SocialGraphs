She's got you high and you don't even know yet
She's got you high and you don't even know yet
It's the search for the time before it leaves without you
Have you lost your mind or has she taken all of yours too?

What's this about? I figured love would shine through
We've lost romance, this world has turned so see through
Open your mind, believe it's gonna come true
Keep romance alive and hope she's gonna tell you

What's this about? I figured love would shine through (She's got you high)
We've lost romance, this world, it's turned so see through
Open your mind, believe it's gonna come true (She's got you high)
Keep romance alive and hope she's gonna tell you

She's got you high and you don't even know yet
She's got you high and you don't even know yet
The sun's in the sky, it makes for happy endings
You can't deny, you want the happy ending
