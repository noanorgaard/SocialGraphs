1 ContributorGolden Wake LyricsAnd in the water I could see
A piece of what you broke in me
I took a walk my usual way
I called to quit my job today
And in these holy, empty hours
When my quiet thoughts get louder
Saying you're born to be this way
You're not meant to be afraid
Sometimes my heart and brain conspire
To set everything on fire
Just to stop the tyranny
Of that minute hand on me
We woke for golden morning hours
Just to soak in all the power
We weren't made to be this way
We weren't made to be afraidYou might also 

So I press my pen into the page
Pretending that these words can change
Feigning that they have some meaning
That they have meaning
You might also 

And she talks softly
Sees through me
Says something
I can't hear it
But I won't forget
The way she flies

Oh, to stare into the void
And see a friendly face
And find meaning in a word
In a moment of rare grace


Talk softly
Walk slowly
Take nothing
I can't hear it
But I won't forget
The way she fliesYou might also
