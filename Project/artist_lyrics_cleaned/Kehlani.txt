And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive

We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
I could never hurt you, we use to be great
And you use to say, what goes around comes around so fast
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass

You used to living through all the screens

You don't know nothing 'bout working your way from the bottom and earning every ring
You think we competing for rings, you think you playing in my league
But you couldn't catch up if I took a break and vacationed for weeks on top of weeks

Take every title, they been ours
Pull up lowkey cause we been stars, been stars

I don't want, what I can get
I want someone, with secrets
That nobody, nobody, nobody knows

I need a gangsta
To love me better
Than all the others do
To always forgive me
Ride or die with me
That's just what gangsters do

My freakness is on the loose
And running, all over you
Please take me to places, that nobody, nobody knows

You got me hanging from the ceiling
Got me up so high I'm barely breathing

Someone told me
Babe, when the tide gets high, you just get low
Hold your breath and take it slow
Yes I might get wet, I might get thrown
But I’ll resurface all on my own

I'll be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
I'll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
No, no, no

I always have those days when I feel unworthy
When I sit back and ask God why he chose me
Cause I'm just human, just like you are
We see the same ol' sky, at night we see the same stars
So if you feeling down, no you not alone
And if you feeling all confused
No you are not on your own
Don't trip, baby just live

Thinking 'bout things that I shouldn't be
Sad about shit I've been sad about for the past year

That my love's in vain
'Cause baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything

Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?

Admiring you from a distance
Scared to go and make a move
Didn't wanna be distracting

Who's raw all by themselves
I'd hate for you to search for someone else

Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
