Here we go!
No
No way!
No one
Gonna stop, now go!

Yo, save the complaint
For a party conversation
The world is loaded
It's lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop

No one
No one!
No way!
Gonna stop, now go!

Farm people
Book wavers, soul savers
Love teachers
They're lit to pop and nobody is gonna stop

Move on
(Did you get control of her mind like that?)
Move on
One come a day, the water will run
No man will stand for things that he had done
Hurrah!
And the water will run
One come a day, the water will run
No man will stand for things that he had done
Hurrah!
And the water will run
It will run, oh
Will run, oh-oh
Good
Go!


Gimme that!
Gimme back your automobile
Turn off that smokestack
And that goddamn radio
Hum along with me
Hum along with the TV
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh no
No one's!
Gonna!
