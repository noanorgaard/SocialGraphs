We are Africa
We are the heartbeat of Africa

With the rhino

The meerkat

The noble lion king

We are Africa
We are the winds of the Serengeti
We are the sweat of the jungle man
We are the tears of Nelson Mandela
We are the lost boys of the Sudan

Just like Bono, I am Africa

I'm not a follower anymore
No, now I'm frickin' Africa
With my Zulu spear
I run barefoot through the sand
I am Africa

Ha na heya, za ba ney
We are Africa (We are Africa)
We are the one, the only Africa (The one and only Africa)
And the life we live is
Primitive and proud (Let us smile and laughrica)
We are Africa
We are deepest, darkest Africa (So deep and dark Africa)
We are the fields and fertile forests
Well endowed
We are Africa (We are Africa)
We are the sunrise on the Savannah

A monkey with a banana

A tribal woman who doesn't wear a bra

Africans are African
But we are
