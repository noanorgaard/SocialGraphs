Lately, I've been building things
Castles and airplanes
I've been painting pictures from my dreams
Yeah, I'm done waiting
Lately, I cross my fingers tight
Superstition in my mind
I must be breaking mirrors, under ladders all the time
Cause I'm followed by the rain

This is the real life (Thousand dollars in my pocket, not enough can change me)
I'm feeling so fine

We're big enough to fill the Milky Way
And we're not afraid
It's my lucky day
Gonna fly around the world

I'm feeling so fine

It's gonna be my lucky day
When the stars align and clouds have gone away
We're big enough to fill the Milky Way
And we're not afraid
It's my lucky day
Gonna fly around the world
Let everybody know my time is now
And my friends at home are pointing from the ground
But I'm not coming down
From my lucky day

Every day will come and go
It's a great big world and I won't stay home
Whoa, oh, gonna fill my heart 'til the time that it overflows
It's gonna be my lucky day
When the stars align and clouds have gone away
We're big enough to fill the Milky Way
And we're not afraid
It's my lucky day
Gonna fly around the world
Let everybody know my time is now
And my friends at home are pointing from the ground
But I'm not coming down
From my lucky
