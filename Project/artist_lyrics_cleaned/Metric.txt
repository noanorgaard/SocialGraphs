Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Fate don't fail me now
(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

And when the days that followed passed
In another mansion built to last
From our window, we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back
But then, the storm returned for more
In a comedown of revolving doors
Auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Fate don't fail me now
(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Fate don't fail me now
(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Fate don't fail me now
(ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Fate don't fail me 

Can you hear my heart beatin' like a hammer?
Beatin' like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beatin' like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps

Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer

If we're still alive, my regrets are few
If my life is mine, what shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing and my heart still beats
