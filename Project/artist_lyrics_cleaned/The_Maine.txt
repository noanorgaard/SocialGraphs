You think I'm ugly
(Don't you?)
And I know you hate my body
If you don't like just what I do
Do what you like
So maybe then you'll want me
Maybe then you'll want me

Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
It's such a pity
No one adores me yet
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"
(Ba ba ba bada) oh am I pretty?

You make me feel like
(Like what?)
Confetti for the gathering
So I'll get used to getting used
I'll do that for you
So maybe then you'll have me
Maybe then you'll have me

All candor and style in the crook of your smile

Oh, you're so naive
Just like a child
And all the happy
It just might take a while
Cause you can't make me smile
Oh, you can't make me smile

And I live in a room with no windows
Too much time on my hands
Too much shit in my head
Yes, there is
I do what I must do to stay alive
Now I wanna feel it
But I will not bother
Building a pool
I'll never swim in

Oh, you so naive

And I'll hide my teeth
Cause it might take a while
Until I learn how to smile 

Oh, Cause you can not make me 

And now
Here I am
I feel numb
On the fence
On the run
Spill my guts
What an act
I am sad
But to me I’m lovely sad

Imaginary numbers
Control the ones we love
Fooled by affectation
And something up above
If you’re in love with diamonds
A simple death you’re dying
A wasted life to me
Here we are all liars
Just hoping to get higher
Than everyone we meet
Huxley said we live together but we’re always by ourselves
If you don’t like this type of weather you can move to someplace else
Significance is rarely found underneath your couch

So now
Here you are
Feeling numb
On the fence
On the run
Down and out
Such a drag
We’re all sad
But to me we’re lovely 

Hallucinating things are fine in my head
Illuminating the right side of my bed

And we kissed and we fought
I laughed and you screamed
Oh I've learned to loathe these
Goddamn visions
But I just can't wait to fall back to sleep

Oh I woke up and I felt let down
You tied up your sliver hair and left this town
You're three hundred something miles away
I close my eyes and all I see is your face

Hallucinating things are fine in my head

To the lows and every high
The hellos and the goodbyes
In this moment, I could die with you
Never felt like this before
Dizzy, drunk and beautiful
In this moment, I let go with you

When you are next to me and the music's loud
Singing "Hey Nineteen" somewhere in the crowd
We're up so high
They can't touch us now
We are thousands of feet from the ground
And won't come down
We won't come down

Yeah, here's to all
To all this culture's rules and your pretty things
How dirty, wild, blurry, juvenile
We ain't got no time for what tomorrow brings
And the choir sings

But sometimes I like
Living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive
Perfectly out of key

I'm not allowed to be anyone else
But me so I try
To take apart my head from time to time
And I'm not resolute so when I
Need help well I would ask you
And I would try to be polite

And sometimes I like

You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
Every moment's relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again

24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
And some kind of muted blue
The TV talks at me
Apocalyptic-ally
Fosters the fear in me
But somehow I hear your plea
With eyes closed I see your face
I breathe deep and hesitate
I hear the words you'd say
Feels like you're here with me
And you say

Are you free or are you in sorrow?
Are you free or are you being borrowed?

How do you feel?
What's your condition?
You are alive but are you living?
Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen
Are you complete or is something missing?
So tell me
Do your hands shake?
Does your heart break?
When the earth quakes
Whatever it is
Whatever it isn't
Make sure that it's real
Oh, now, how do you feel?

To all the dearly depressed and broken hearted
The in-betweens and all the torn ones too

I wonder why nobody is asking you

My heart is in the city of love
But it's raining in Paris
What good is a heart of gold
With nobody to share it with
It's coming down, it's coming down
My head can hardly bare it
My heart is in the city of love
But it's raining in Paris

So let it rain on me
See my heart's on fire
But I always got cold feet
Love never really did anything for me
Try telling that to this goddamn city
And if the storm should stop
I'd ask you to dance on some cliche mountain top
We'd share straws at your favorite coffee shop
But life it ain't no romance novel

I met a man
Who sold umbrellas and
Just five dollars
Saved me from all that rain
For now I am alone
I think I like being 

Kids in costumes
Dressed like Kings and Queens
Little monsters
Walking down my street
In this place I'll
Be anything but me
So you be brave and
I'll still be eighteen

So just this once
Yeah just for now
Yeah, you can be anything
Anything in the world
And darling don't
Don't you start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's just make believe

Kids in costumes
Dressed for Halloween
Ghosts and goblins
Walking down my street
We're all monsters
Living in a dream
So you be you
And I'll still be happy
