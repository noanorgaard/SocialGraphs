You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit naïve with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
And I feel sparks

But I don't wanna be into you if you're not lookin' for true love
Oh, woah
No, I don't wanna start seein' you if I can't be your only one
So, tell me

When it's not alright
When it's not okay
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay (Say okay)

Feel safe

When it's not alright (Not alright)
When it's not okay (Not okay)
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Don't run away

Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away, so
Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away?
Will you hold me close and say
When it's not alright (Not alright)
When it's not okay (Not okay)
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (Say alright)
Will you say okay? (Say okay)
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay (Say okay)
Don't run away (Yeah-yeah, say okay)

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say okay?
Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay
Don't run away
Will you say
