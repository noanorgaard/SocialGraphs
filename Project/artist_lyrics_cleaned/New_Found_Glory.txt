Just maybe you need this
And I didn't mean to lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back, it was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true, I'd still pick my friends over you

My friends over you

Please tell me everything that you think that I should know
About all the plans you made, when I was nowhere to be found
And it's alright to forget that we still talk
It's just for fun, isn't it? It's my fault that it fell apart

Just maybe you need this
And I didn't mean to lead you on
You might also like
You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back, it was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true, I'd still pick my friends over you

My friends over you (You, you, you, you)

(Ah, ah-ah!)
(Ah-ah!)

Just maybe you need this, you need this
And I didn't mean to lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back, it was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true, I'd still pick my friends over
You were everything I wanted (Everything I wanted)
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back for you, it was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true, I'd still pick my friends over you
My friends over
