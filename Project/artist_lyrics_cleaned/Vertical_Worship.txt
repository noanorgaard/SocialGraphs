And after all, You are constant
After all, You are only good
After all, You are sovereign
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Thank you Lord

You were singing in the dark
Whispering Your promise
Even when I could not hear
I was held in Your arms
Carried for a thousand miles to show
Not for a moment did You forsake me
Not for a moment did You forsake me
You might also like
And after all, You are constant
After all, You are only good
After all, You are sovereign
Not for a moment did You forsake me
Not for a moment will You forsake me

And every step, every breath, You are there
Every tear, every cry, every prayer
In my hurt, at my worst, when my world falls down
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Not for a moment will You forsake me

After all, You are constant
Yes, after all, You are only good
After all, You are sovereign
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Not for a moment will You forsake me
After all, You are constant
After all, You are only good
After all, You are sovereign
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Not for a moment will You forsake me
Thank You, Lord
You are faithful, God
Yes You are
And You are constant
You are good
You will never leave us, Jesus
You will never forsake us O Lord
For we are Your children
Your call us by name
We are Yours O Lord
We belong to You
Faithful God
We belong to You
You will never leave us
You will never leave us
Yes

You came from heavens throne
Acquainted with our sorrow
To trade the debt we owe
Your suffering for our freedom

The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the Lamb of God

My name upon Your heart
My shame upon Your shoulders
The power of sin undone
The cross for my salvation

The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the Lamb of God

There is no greater love
There is no greater love
The Savior lifted up
There is no greater love!
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
And my Savior lifted up
There is no greater love!
