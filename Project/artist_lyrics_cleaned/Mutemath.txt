I never meant to have to start all over
Start all over without you

Drifting out alone, lying in the stratosphere
Wishing I was anywhere else
Lying next to you
There's nothing in this galaxy
Holding my attention
The sun has lost its gravity and
Severed my connection
To the starlight

Strange old ground got a little too familiar now

Stroll on, we don't belong here
Stroll on, we'll fall apart here
Stroll on, we don't belong here
Stroll on, stroll on, stroll on

Can you feel the weight on your shoulder lift?
Nobody's holding the line
Some doubts just serve as a hypnotist
Till hope can wake up your mind

Same old sounds getting all a little too familiar now

Stroll on, we don't belong here
Stroll on, we'll fall apart here
Stroll on, we don't belong here
Stroll on, stroll on, stroll on

And stroll, stroll, stroll on
And stroll, stroll, stroll on
And stroll, stroll, stroll on

Stroll on
Stroll on
Stroll on

Always the same
Always forever we remain
Always the same
I’m dying just to keep my place

I’ve been breaking
And repairing everything that I make
Just to feel important
And worth the little space that I take
I keep on delaying
Everything I’d rather avoid
Rapidly decaying
And panicking I’m losing the choice
