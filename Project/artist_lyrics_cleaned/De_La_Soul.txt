Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me, myself and I (Say it now)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's just me, myself and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's just me, myself and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's just me, myself and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Say it now)

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me, myself and I (Say it now)

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please, oh, please let Plug Two be himself
Not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me, myself and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's just me myself and I

Glory, glory, halleluj'
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they diss my person by stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, "Black is Black"
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin' up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do, I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me, myself and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's just me, myself and I (Me myself and who?)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's just me, myself and I

Oh

Contestant number-four, do you have the answers?
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue
I can't think of it, I just can't think of 

Up in them five-star tellies saying two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without saying the producer's name all over the track
Yeah, I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit
Now quit now before we pour
That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow

From the top of the key for three – Villain
Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn
Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh, give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to free power like LILCo
And still owe bills, paid dues forever
Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer
Used to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar
And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar
Ya heard? Holler
Broad or dude, we need food
Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put ya kicks up, it's a stick up

Now put your blicks up
These Riddick Bowe cuts-is fold like penile flicks, and give 'em twenty
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller (Taller)
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad, crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and lose your mouth

DOOM brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam and 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Their rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, ring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul; we all know the rules, bro – you slow, you blow
The Super, you fools, his own Boss like Hugo

You go lights, camera, action with no make-up
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours – dispersee
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from being hot
It's about if you can handle being cold or not
And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since, y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the praise, or to raise the bar
Yet, it's raised anyway, so amazing, are –
The three L.I. brothers from the other way of thinking
Hey, your lady's winking, I think you need to control that
Or I'll have to hold that!
The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo, let's cookie-cut this shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sipping broads like 7-Up (Ahh... so refreshing!)
I finger-pop these verses like first dates
The birthdate's September 2-1, 1-9-6-8
Too old to rhyme? Too bad, too
