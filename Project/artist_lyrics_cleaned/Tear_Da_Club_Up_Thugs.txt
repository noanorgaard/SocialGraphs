Pickin' up the murder scripts so come audition for the role
And the code of the motherfuckin' Triple Six sitcom, ugh
Niggas catchin' the infection from the rich so come along
For the mark on your arm, it's the end, come
Ball on to the next century, misery
Scarecrow got a murder that is goin' down in history
A train from the north
A train from the south
The east and west
They all collided
All the niggas died
Cause of greed and pride
Cause I will pursue you
Screw you
Put a slug through you
The voodoo brutally
Ride I'm seventh of the sign
I'm the sniper you can't find
And my slug made of shiny jewelry
Mr. Boogie Man, fee-fi-fo-fum
I smell some money in his hand, take his side arm
I don't give a fuck about your side
You can be from L.A., Miami, or the N-Y

We gonna take you to the Triple Six Clubhouse
We got a plot for you already dug out
I'm gonna run outside mane
And pop these thangs
Wanna, wanna come play in the black rain

Hearses drivin round your house, hoodoo hex
Voodoo dolls dancin' on your bed, throwin devil sets
Sick, sadistic, nothin' up my sleeve
Muddy boots, blazin' crickets, call me Crow Voorhees (blay!)
Crow got a lust for the devilish bust
And the Triple Six crush
And a touch like Malachi
Rollin' every spot
Lookin for yo' ass and we hot
With the infrareds on ninnas flashin' like some fuckin' disco lights
We gonna cut ya into itty-bitty parts
Meet me on your side of town
Where they keep the graveyards
Crushed glass, dead rats, lots of trash
Empty shells, crack sells in these streets
Black males found in blood trails
Ain't enough mail for all y'all to prevail
So the weak get put to sleep and they smell while they pale
Sippin on the softy wine of your sweet softy blood
My name is Scarecrow bitch, yo
Welcome to my club
