I ain't got time for you, baby
Either you're mine or you're not
Make up your mind sweet, baby
Right here, right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got

Islands, diamonds, trips around the world
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop

Goddamn

Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands and the room's abuzz
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit-chat 'bout the things they got
And my stout reputation of keepin' it hot
I'm the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize I'm your man

See the people get live underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold on while I take this flick
Speakeasy, rockin' the feathers, I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, 'cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

What do you think, GoonRock?
Are you ready?

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show, after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' and reminiscin'
On days when I had a Mustang

I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy thangs that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know
