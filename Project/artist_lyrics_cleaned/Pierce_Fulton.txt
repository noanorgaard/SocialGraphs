'Cause you feel like home
And I'm a runaway
And I know that without you
I wouldn't last one day
'Cause you feel like home
And I'm a runaway
And I know that without you
I wouldn't last one day
No


If this is the road that we will take
Walking the line between bend and break
I need a hand to hold on to
But yours is far away
Take me back to where we're from
Way before all of this begun
Give me back my faith in us
My faith in love
You might also like
'Cause you feel like home
And I'm a runaway
And I know that without you
I wouldn't last one day, no
(Whoa-, whoa-, whoa-, whoa-oh
Whoa-, whoa-, whoa-, whoa-oh)
