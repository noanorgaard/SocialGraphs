At the magic centre of dreams
They turn the story into  free
To be true
To be true
To be true
Colours of you

, get in the flow
Lifes not meant to be a struggle
The trouts in the stream
Its such a nice dream

I'm in love, I’m in love
There's a flame burning in the heart of me
There's a pain buried deep inside of me
And I know what makes it so
Cause I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I’m in love
There’s a fire started up inside of me
There's a change it’s coming over all of me
And I know what makes it so
Cause I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I’m in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
But does she love me or does she not
Does she want me yeah or does she not
I don't know, I don't know
And I know what makes it so
Cause I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I've never felt this way before
What a crazy feeling baby
Come on baby
Don't you know I'm in love
I'm in love
Don't you know I'm in love babyYou might also
