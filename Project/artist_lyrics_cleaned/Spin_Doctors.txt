Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?

Other people's thoughts, they ain't your hand-me-downs
Would it be so bad to simply turn around?
You cook so well, all nice and French
You do your brain surgery, too, mama, a-with your monkey wrench

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?
You might also like
Yeah-uh, yeah, can't be wrong
No, no, no, you can't be wrong
Oh, you can't be wrong, you can't be wrong
You can't be wrong, no, no, no

I hope them cigarettes are gonna make you cough
I hope you hear this song and it pissed you off
I take that back, I hope you're doing fine
And if I had a dollar, I might give you ninety-nine

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?

Oh, little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, you can't be wrong, no, you can't be wrong
You can't be wrong

Oh, you can't be wrong
Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dababa…

This one, he got a princely racket
That's what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain't in his head now
You marry him, your father will condone you
How 'bout that now?
You marry me, your father will disown you
He'll eat his hat now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree, but
I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be
You might also like
Said if you want to call me baby
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me "maybe"
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now


Said one, two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that's some bread now
This one who wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree, but
I know what a prince and lover ought to be

Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

Oh-oh! Just, just go ahead now
