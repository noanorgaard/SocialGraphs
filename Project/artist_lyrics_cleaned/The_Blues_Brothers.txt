I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

Got what I got the hard way
And I'll make it better each and every day
So honey, don't you fret
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man, ow
I'm a soul man, play it, Steve
I'm a soul man, ah
I'm a soul man, ha

Listen, I was brought up on a side street
Learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated from good stock
'Cause when I start lovin', I just can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, ha

Well, grab the rope, and I'll pull you in
Give you hope, and be your only boyfriend
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
You're a soul man, ha
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, ha, ha
