Yo, flood the scene, hit the strip, get my fix
Got some sniffles in the sack, run this town like a sprinter on the track
Come on, lay back to attack in the 'Lac
We ain't cutting no slack, girl, what you know about that?
I ain't trying to be your lover, but I gotta say
That we can keep it undercover when you wanna play
Blazed up, smoked out, out of my mind
We just cruise around my town all the time

When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down 'cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town

If the city never sleeps, then, fuck it, neither will I
You know we keep it thirty-deep and we're as high as the sky
You can watch us thirty-creep as we just ride and we ride
You can watch the Fiesta drop from one side to side
We're breaking the boulevard 'cause we get it better
If ever you need to find me, bitch, you can send me a letter
Forever drunk and disorderly off this vodka I'm pouring me
Goddamn, man, I want it all, my city of glory!

When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down 'cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town

The streets you walk give you a reason
'Cause it's all you got and that'll never change
So keep singing that song and we can live forever
Pour a little out for the ones who passed away
When the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
So drink 'em down 'cause some things never change
Baby, sing it loud, we ain't gonna fuck around
When the sun goes down let me hear you say

This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town
This is my town
It's my town, it's my town, it's my town

Can't stop the feeling, high as the ceiling
I got the money, who's fucking dealing?
You feel the heat like the barrel of a gun
I forgot the last time I saw the sun
We've got this disease that's digging deeper in me
It's like my mind is leaving but my heart keeps beating
So I'll paint the walls red, drip from the nose
Where it goes, nobody really knows
Hit the bottle, she's gone, I'll follow
I fall asleep, there ain't no tomorrow
Gone so far, no one can save me
Who needs you when I got my baby?
My baby's beautiful, she loves me true
And if she dies, I hope I die too

I'mma put down on another sack of them
Then it's straight back to the flask again
I can't help stop what's happening
On the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again
Up shit's creek and I'm paddling
Blacked out room in a Travel Inn
Good ideas, I'm lacking them
I'm too fucked up, now I'm babbling
Wonderin' how to fix these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covered myself with bandages
From all these d-damn damages
Wonderin' how to fix these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covered myself with bandages

You know I can take you straight to heaven if you let me

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

My body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is a police sketch of my mask
And it's hard at times to ask
If you can save my heart for last
And it's hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make-believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe
So, come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killin' by the millions
And billions of people die for a lost cause
So now I pray to my nation destroyed under God

All my battles have been won
But the war has just begun

From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fucking skyline crashes
They catch us with matches, ignite the flame
And all the hopes of a youth deemed fucking insane
They say, "Take the pill, in God we trust
Go and kill, God loves us
As in life, as in death
Breathing till there is no breath"
I will not die in the night, but in the light of the sun
With the ashes of this world in my lungs
But who am I to say?
Let's all just run away
Grab your saints and pray
And we'll burn this world today
It's the end of the world
As in heaven, as on Earth
We've been dead since our birth

Let's watch this city burn
From the skylines on top of the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll use the trees as torches
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll flood the streets with corpses
Do you wanna burn it with me?
We'll watch the city fucking bleed
Do you wanna burn it with me?
And bring the world to its knees
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Let's watch this city burn

Till there's nothing left in her

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrón
I want a girl on my lap and a Jägerbomb
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And I'mma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I'll drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good, then it can't be wrong
I'm coming in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots, and if not, you're nerdy

We only leave a pre-party to go party some more
I'm already shitfaced before I walk in the door
This girl's rubbing on my leg, I've never met her before
And now she's making her way down to my gentleman's sword
It might be the drugs talking or the shots of Patrón
But these bitches look like models, and they're ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents' house, we'll be Home Alone
I'll slap them chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin
She's tearing it up, yeah, she's dancing her ass off
This girl's like a Mac the way she's riding my laptop
I'm tryna get my rocks off, so don't try to cock-block
Or I'll grab my sawed-off, and I'll blow your cock off
You know we drink so much, we're getting drunk for weeks
We drink so much Goose, we're turning into geese
Me and my crew fly the V through VIP
These bitches play my skin flute like they're Kenny G

If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got shit, throw your hands up

Get gone with it, there's nothing wrong with it
Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel you bounce, girl, go up and down
Take shots, won't stop till I'm passing out
So girl, get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my man sword
You're gonna have to rock this house, I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor
I ain't tryna go home with nolla, nolla
We can hit the dance floor when you wanna, wanna
Girl, you know you're feeling me so holla, holla
'Cause everyone compared to me is nada, nada
Okay, dawg, this has gone on for way long
Can't quit my day job till I'm played on K-ROQ

We did it for the glory
The glory, only the glory
We live and die the story
It's our story, all for the glory

Bullets begin to strip
A man of reason, he's a man of sin
The men of treason are the ones who live
They'll take what you've got, what you've got to give
An empire, a trial by fire
There are liars lighting funeral pyres
A letter to a mother from across the sea
A son in a box buried beneath
For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee
For whom they smile when they put you to sleep
A deal with the devil is a deal with me
That deal is forever, as long as you breathe
Go forth, child, make us proud
Honor is yours underground
Know we loved you, lay you down

Nobody runs or makes it out alive
Out alive

I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky, I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it
I watch the beauty of all our lives, passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt
We get so sick, we're so sick, we never wanted all this
Medication for the kids with no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

As we walk among these shadows in these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the mantle, raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark; in the rain, you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home
But you take all we are, the innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

We are young, but we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We will fight (We will fight)
Or we will fall (we will fall)
