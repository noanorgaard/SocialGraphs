Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders and put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need

She likes New York at night
She dreams of running away
Shine on bright like the sun
When even the sky turns gray
I need you to hear me say
I need you to hear me say

Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need

Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Let go of the ones who try to put you down
You're gonna be fine, don't hold it inside
If you hurt right now, then let it all come out

Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need
Breathe, just breathe
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on me
Breathe, just breathe
Let the life that you live be all that you need

Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Let the life that you live be all that you need
Let go of the fear, let go of the doubt
Take the world off your shoulders, put it on

I remember drinking as the stars were falling
I remember dancing on the hotel's unmade bed

So wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
Wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me

To the beat
Of your heart as my hand touches your skin
Is this love

We're gonna start a fire

Taking chances in the back of your car
We burn and on the radio is "Rockin' in a Free World"
S.O.S., so obsessed
Oh you make me such a mess
Why can't this just last forever, why, why, why?

So wake up, wake up dreaming
And lie here with me
Here we go
Just lose control and let your body give in
To the beat
