Don't speak for me
I'll get with it, give it just a little longer
Don't speak for me
Yeah I'll be there soon
Honestly
Every day I feel a little bit stronger than I was when I was
When I was with you
Yeah it's true
Yeah it's true

People try to box me in
Telling me it's sink or swim
Maybe I should sink until I stand
Out here where the water's deep
I think I found a voice in me
And someday we will walk upon dry land

Flashbacks get me close
I'm almost there

Headlight in the driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Out there on the high dive
You dance with your headphones on and I
Could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's

Black jacket, a blue motorbike
Pass the mission in the moonlight
Teenagers in the alley kissing
Smell of gas burn, saw your street sign
I'm doing eighty in a forty-five
Throwing shadows you could hear if you listen, yeah

Flashbacks get me close
But I'm staring at someone else's

Headlights in your driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Meet me on the high dive
You'll dance with your headphones on
So I could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Someone else's song, to someone else's song
To someone else's, someone else's, someone else's 

For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

I’ve café-crawled through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I’ve seen London, and I’ve played Japan
I’ve been knocked down; I got up again
