And only you, 

A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
Singing, oh-woah
Ooh, oh-woah
Ooh-woah
Oh, yeah

How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

How do you fit all that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

You're a star girl
Take a bow
It's just one thing that's killing me
How you get that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
