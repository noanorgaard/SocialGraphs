This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me

And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Hunt)
People sayin', "Ye, we need another Yeezus" (Hunt)
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wildin' out, out"
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession

Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me "That was just some foul shit"
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
