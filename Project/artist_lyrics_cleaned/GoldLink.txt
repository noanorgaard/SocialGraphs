When I saw him, there was just something different. Like we always have so much fun. And they're crazy, like - him and his friends, they're so funny. It makes me so happy to be with them. Even when they say that he's the bad guy. You hear shit, but you find how to tune it out. Life's too short to ask questions. When you see Goldlink...just know that's all me, 

She put the CD in and said there is a God
And read the bible just to know that the I'm the Ahmadinejad
I killed Osama, burned a few Qurans for me to get this far
Devil dancing music, you can feel him in your car
The Allure that Hova rapped about
Jehovah beat a witness, We so Christian, we still fornicating
California, valley naked, make it just to fake it Imma take it
If it's mine, I spend it, then I shit it, then you lick it up
Why we sin so hard to feel so good?
Why we sinning? Just to get in good?
Why we selling just to get a buck
Thats why we stick you up
Up nigga, West side
Duck nigga, whop whop, we up, nigga
Pop drop. Don't get stuck, nigga
Rap niggas over pop niggas
Tight jeans for the sus niggas
Peter Parker told Glizzy I was up, nigga
That's what's up, nigga
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
If I decide to commit suicide would you love me more
Or would you do or die?
Suicide is like genocide
So I ride around with my tended mind getting high
Backwoods never that good
I hate when my girl smoke shit
I don't trust niggas so I don't smoke shit
Plus, niggas straight sleazy, that's street shit
No Gleesh shit, mo'eesh shit
Her father with the box cut, and her mama fatter than an armored truck
Put it all on us
Gang bang shit, kickin' Liu Kang shit
Bang bang shit
Poo poo all on ya don't say shit
And I'm just warming up, nigga
You get used to this shit
No beginners luck, bitch
I'm a mother fucking problem and I walk with a pimp's limp

Nakakainis talaga siya, pero iniisip ko na mahal na mahal ko siya. Parang palaging kami magkasama, pero may tiwala na ako sa kanya. Lahat ng ibang tao na dumating bago sa kanya, wala na sila. Di na bale

I learned a lot in such a short amount of time
Everything that's fuckin' fine and gold, it ain't mine
Met you when I was like maybe fifteen years old and you
Just act a lil' older plus I heard you came from Arizona
And I was new so I was poppin' up at house parties
Ridin' fuckin' dirty wit' the older niggas ridin' for me
And they just taught me how the game work
I said fuck it, I'ma push the rock and buy a lot of dumb shit
But fuck it, was my initial thought when I had met you
I was sittin' in the bleachers when your girls approached me
And they threw away your number like you wasn't taken or something
I told 'em, "Baby, I'm nothing, see why you wanna choose me?"
They giggled and walked away, I prayed to God
It felt so right, I never knew the devil fuckin' looked this nice
So if you ever tried to blame it on me
I'ma blame it on my dick, know I'm sick, yeah I'd run through ya

Picked rappin', they chose, I blew, my crew
Got big, split wigs, still rob, mo' rap
We battle, we fight, we won, big one
No pun, all skill, no bitch in my clique
