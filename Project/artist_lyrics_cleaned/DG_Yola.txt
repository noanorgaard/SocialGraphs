See, I don't know what y'all been told
But I gotta get, get me a big bank roll
Yes, a fat bag of that sticky and some bad ass hoes
So when I step out on the scene, suckers already know
To start hatin', start talkin' about my clothes
You see I'm pimped out, come try to knock me for my hoes
I'm a real nigga, so I ain't gon buy them Eddie Gold's
I ain't gon' trick off with that bitch
And ain't gon hang around my foes
I'ma get money nigga, so fuck it, I'll kick some doors
Hit the block like the sun, and get rid of all the snow
You can call me a don, 'cause of the way I flow
I'm a good role model, just look at me as a pro
Gangsta Gutta raised me, so it's Gutta 'til I die
Them suckers hate me, you can see it in they eyes
When I come around they frown, then wanna dap me down
But when I leave, them bastards talk about me like a clown
But I don't give a fuck

I ain't gon' give up, no, I ain't gon' let up
No, I ain't gon' shut up
And ain't gon' never let them haters get to me
Oh, no-no, they'll never get to me
Oh, no-no, oh, no-no
I ain't gon' let up, no, I ain't gon' shut up
No, I ain't gon' give up
And ain't gon' never let them haters get to me
Oh, no-no, they'll never get to me
Oh, no-no, oh, no-no

But I just don't give a fuck, 'cause I'm all out wit' it
The game ain't dirty mane, it's just the niggas in it
You can't even wear a jersey, they try to peep ya tags
Can't smoke a blunt of kush, 'cause you 'round too many crabs
Nigga, get yourself together, go give ya brain a bath
Go to church, start listenin', and get on the right path
Ya study long, ya study wrong, ya get it in ya or get gone
Ya live fake, you'll die fake, and that's just the way it goes
I'm a gangsta, young nigga, so I keep my mouth close
My ears and eyes open, so I can focus on the shit around me
I know they gon' doubt me
But all I wonder why in the fuck do they come around me?
I gotta say down, I'ma shine like a light
Stunt on all these cock roaches
Whether I'm wrong or if I'm right, nigga
Hey, I get money, that's something I like to do
You say motherfuck me, nah, motherfuck you
'Cause I don't give a fuck

I ain't gon' give up, no, I ain't gon' let up
No, I ain't gon' shut up
And ain't gon' never let them haters get to me
Oh, no-no, they'll never get to me
Oh, no-no, oh, no-no
I ain't gon' let up, no, I ain't gon' shut up
No, I ain't gon' give up
And ain't gon' never let them haters get to me
Oh, no-no, they'll never get to me
Oh, no-no, oh,
