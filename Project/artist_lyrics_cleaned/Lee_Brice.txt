I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
'Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party

Well, the opening band is doin' sound-check

Every-time another pretty girl comes walking by
I see your wheels turning
The way you watch my eyes, girl I don't know why

I roll every window down
