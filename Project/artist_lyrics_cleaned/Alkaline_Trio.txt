I used to long for broken bones
I used to long for a casket to call my own
I never had a problem facing fear
But I'm done, over and out, my dear, and

Oh, mercy me
God bless catastrophe
Well there's no way in hell
We'll ever live to see through this
So drive yourself insane tonight, it's not that far away
And I just filled up your tank earlier today, yeah

It's been a long day living with this
It's been a long time since I felt so sick
I took a long walk straight back home
I could've walked back to Chicago
I used to long for time alone
I used to long for a place of my own
And I've lost faith in everything
I'm lost, so lost, I'm lost without you

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase
All the damage done to your name and your keepsakes
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were blind, deaf and dumb
There's a party in my closet, calling all skeletons
Calling all skeletons
Calling oh-oh-oh

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase
All the damage done, all this pain, all this heartache
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were fucked up and numb
There's a killer on the corner and he's looking for love
Looking for love
Yeah, he's looking for you, my love

And to tell you the truth I lost my faith in you
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
And these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
They're hiding just behind your eyes

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Where did you go once the lights went black?
You nearly gave us a heart attack
We thought you might have swam out to sea
You gotta stop sneaking off on me
You gotta stop sneaking off on 

I lied, I lied to the FBI
When I told them that I did it to save her hide
Told them that the plan for the heist was mine
Now I'm stuck and I'm fucked doing federal time

Locked deep inside I'm doing time for you
Just got the letter saying we are through
And I don't give a damn if I get out again
I'm doing time for you

She lied, she lied to the FBI
When she told them she was innocent of victimless crime
Now I don't give a shit and I'd never drop dime
On my baby though she gave me to the FBI

Saw you standing there outside the music hall
You'd come out for some air, uncertain curtain call
And everyone just stared when you took the stage that night
Something's not right

You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, help me, won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself

Here I'll find you in between Heaven and Hell again
Where nothing's what it seems, it's just as well, my friend
I'm giving me the creeps and a farewell to arms
And legs, and heads, and all
