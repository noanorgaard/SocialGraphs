It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La-la-la, whatever
La-la-la, it doesn't matter
La-la-la, oh, well, la-la-la

We're goin' at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh?

I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
Honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a, na-a-a-a

Honestly, everybody's stoked I'm finally free
Honestly, my phone's blowing up tonight
I'll go out, get drunk again
Make out with all your dumb friends
Tag your face
Just to rub it in

Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
You're out of line, out of line, good night
