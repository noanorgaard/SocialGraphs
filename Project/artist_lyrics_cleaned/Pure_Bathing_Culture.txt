Or are you cut in two?
Cut all the way through
Are you cut in two?
Cut all the way through

Are you hot and heavy jungle?
Visions lifted in the lace
Was it just a little taste?
Did you say it to his face?
Now you’re dancing in the shadows
And they’re calling out your name
Is it pleasure? Is it pain?
Did you pray for rain?
