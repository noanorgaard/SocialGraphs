I remember backpackin' by the water
Late days, I could see the bottom
Free-falling to words from the 90's over fire pits
Through scattered words and my mistakes
I hope you heard what I meant to say

There will be times when it rains on you
I'll be the knife edge you can hold on to
And on the day when I turn to dust
I hope you know just how much I love you

You

I know a love that looks me right in the eyes
Helps me see beyond boundaries and lines
Unveils a better side of me
Sometimes it's all I need

This love I've found, life's greatest lesson
In my wake, I hope it leaves an impression
What has been paves the road for what's to be
With every step I take, I'll let it lead

Pool parties at the Montreal
Everybody wet but still thirsty
Half-naked thoughts, what an ambiance
With more nipple slips than at Mardi Gras

And we were dancing in summer rain
I knew we would end in pain
Wishing I could keep you
Thought we knew everything
Now you're just a memory
But baby I still see you

By the oceanside
With your hand in mine
My heart won't forget
I recall your laugh
Caught in photographs
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget
My heart won't forget

I'm dancing in flames
I'm dancing in flames
I ain't scared of the blaze
Don't rescue me
And now I'm burning in your arms
Endless fire in my heart
No, it's not a false alarm
No, it's not a false alarm

But here we are
I never get my hopes up
Cause then I'll never get let down
But you were something special
I didn't notice until now

I heard sirens in my head
From the first time that we met
Thought it was a false alarm
Yeah, we started as a spark
Didn't think we'd come this far
