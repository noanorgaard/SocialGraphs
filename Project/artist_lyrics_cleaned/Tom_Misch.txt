And baby it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby it's alright with me
Wander, wander, wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Wander with me, need to call you home
You felt nothing
Now you never feel alone
Wander with me, winter won't let go
A dream of sunlight
Lining your shadow
You might also like
And baby it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby it's alright with me
Wander, wander, wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright, it's alright, it's
