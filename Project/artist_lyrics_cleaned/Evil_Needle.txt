That all I think about is time
But I am not gonna worry
Never been outta line, never asked a reason why
And I am not gonna worry
Not gonna worry, no

Out, out, out
No never asked a reason why
Never, never

Whoa

Things could take a turn so commonly
If don't believe me just wait and see
But ain't just a perfect recipe (So pеrfect)
