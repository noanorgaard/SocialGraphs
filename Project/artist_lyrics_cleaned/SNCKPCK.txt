I didn't know what to say
All of my friends told me
To runaway
To runaway aye aye
To runaway
Promise me I won’t feel dumb
If I make you my number one
My friends all think that I should run like
Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Like Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Somebody told me, that I should just runaway
She ain't the one, gotta run see another day
Might be fun, in a month she'll be gone away
Then it’s on to the next- what did someone say? (RUN)
That I should runaway but I couldn't
My lil Snackpack after all the work I put in (Pudding)
Got me sky high when I land need cushion
Broken elevator button (But thеn) I keep pushing, yea
Don't waste your time on mе
At least that's what I tried to say
Don't waste your time on me
But it still happens every Saturday
Don't waste your time on me
I-I don't think you can find love that way
Don't waste your time on me
But we finna find out today
You might also likePromise me I won’t feel dumb
If I make you my number one
My friends all think that I should run like
Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Like Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Run Forrest run Forrest Run
Some ding bop told me, that you could get far are your own
Don’t worry bout the people on your phone
They can stay their ass at home
So Ima get goin for myself, get going for no one else
Ooooh yea I heard you were trouble
Spent a few weeks in the bubble
Had a triple double, oh woooo
I guess I'ma find out
I’m not a hooper, I'm a shooter and you're mine now (Pow)
She said you better be smart boy
You been playin with my heart boy
And all the trips to Japan and the rides in the lamb
I just don't know where to start boy
And in the way that you hold me
Feels like you already know me
And all of my notions are lost in the ocean
I forget what everyone told me
You took my breathe away
I didn’t know what to say
All of my friends told me
To runaway
To runaway aye aye
To runaway
Promise me I won't feel dumb
If I make you my number one
My friends all think that I should run like
