Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh

Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an armageddon flame (Hey)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another "Amen?" (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Sieg Heil to the President Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel Towers
Who criticize your government
Bang-bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, settin' fire

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world

Mmm, hmm-hmm

In an ordinary world?

In an ordinary world

Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

Well, Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in Tinseltown
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat
In the name of misery
Then Gina hit the roads to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally
