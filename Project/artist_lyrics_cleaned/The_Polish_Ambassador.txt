So you can hold all of the folds
Of all these parts that become sore
When waves crash shorelines to this heart
And beat by beat taken apart...
You might also like
It's just another harsh case of cannibalism
Oops, I really meant to say capitalism...
After the rhythm dies down...
Will it revitalize your soul when you remember the sound?
If not, you're listening to audio garbage
Shitty as can be
R.I.P
No homage
We hit the lab, and we're hoping to accomplish
Jams that'll lead you to the land that's promised
Honest
Raw sentiments project
You see us at the set
And we instantly connect
Cause we've been thinking bout y'all for days
So here's a little something for us modern day slaves...
No companies, no filters, no residue
Just the impact of this vibe we're sending you
I've gotta say with no further adieu
We're happy to be here with you (echo)

So you can hold all of the folds
Of all these parts that become sore
When waves crash shorelines to this heart
And beat by beat taken apart...
"Why"
A usual way we start questions
"How" we advance through life & learn lessons
Suggestions are made and then explored
I'm positive
Whatever's negative gets ignored
We're on a mission
Can you see that?
I float a theory through the air, now can you breathe that?
If you inhale
You embark on a tale
Don't grieve over things you leave
Just set sail
There's no fail
There is only success
If you learn from mistakes you made, and progress
Maybe it's best that we halt this discussion
Sit back and just bathe in percussion
Let the rhythm just carry us away
As we twirl through the atmosphere
And just sway
I've gotta say with no further adieu
We're happy to be here with you (echo)

So you can hold all of the folds
Of all these parts that become sore
When waves crash shorelines to this heart
And beat by beat taken
