I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood, heat, over tension
And I know, oh-woah-oh

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes
I don't wanna die

I just got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)
Haven't learned my lesson (Learned my lesson), woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions, woah
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh

I know we made a graveyard of this song (Mmm)
I know I don't feel too sober now (No, no)
I wanna lie awake with your black soul (Ooh)
Count your fears if you let me

Baby, I just want your damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions, woo
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, 

Let me be your lullaby, playing in your head, this song every night
Give me ten minutes, let me bare my soul
I've seen this all before, seems like a lifetime ago
What's it all, what's it all worth?

I don't wanna be alive if it doesn't feel like this right now, feeling right now
I'm not afraid to die, if you're by my side it's all right now, feeling right now
Be there when I'm alone
Love me even though I'm a motherfuckin' rolling stone
Carry me home and I'll love you
I won't, I won't go

Some shit I gotta work on
I just hope that you won't move on
Uh oh, uh oh, ooh
I'm begging baby, hold on
I'll call you tonight when I'm alone
Alone, alone, ooh
