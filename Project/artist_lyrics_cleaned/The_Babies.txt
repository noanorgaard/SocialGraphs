Life is funny
Life's a laugh
Life is lonely
Yeah it's a drag
And what's your name?
How ya doin'?
I like your hair
How do ya do it?
It's not fair that you're taken
And it's unfair that you're spoken for

And I don't care
You're not a traitor
I'll take the stairs
And not the elevator
You might also likeAnd one day, I'll see you at the top
Our love will never stop

And I've been under way too long

Oh, what a drag!
