From the motel window
The stars twinkle and the signs glow
I see all the places you've taken me
And all the places we'll go together

Hold me spoon me and I'll pretend
In your arms that I am pregnant
With your baby, yeah, your baby
Your two babies softly sleeping

From the motel window
The stars twinkle and the signs glow
I see all the places you've taken me
And all the places we'll go together
You might also like
You're my Mickey, I'm your Mallory
You're my Kurt, I'm your Courtney
You're my Joe, I'm your Norma
You're my Clarence and I'm your Alabama

From the motel window
The stars twinkle and the signs glow
I see all the places you've taken me
And all the places we'll go
