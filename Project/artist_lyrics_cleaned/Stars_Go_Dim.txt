Just look around and you'll see that people
Are scared to say how they really feel, oh
We all need a little honesty, yeah

You Are Loved
If your heart's in a thousand pieces
If you're lost and you're far from reason
Just look up, know you are loved
Just look up, know
You Are Loved
When it feels like somethings missing
If it hurts but you can't find healing
Just look up, know you are loved
Just look up, know
You Are Loved

We're not made to be superheroes
Photoshopped, all size zeroes
A light not expected
But not quite perfected yet
You might also like
Look up see the sun is shining
There's hope on a new horizon
Calling you, it's calling

You Are Loved
If your heart's in a thousand pieces
If you're lost and you're far from reason
Just look up, know you are loved
Just look up, know
You Are Loved
When it feels like somethings missing
If it hurts but you can't find healing
Just look up, know you are loved
Just look up, know you are loved

You don't have to prove yourself
Don't try to be someone else
You don't have to prove yourself
Don't try to be someone else
