Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone
Jesus died my soul to save
And melt my heart of stone

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

At Your cross held my exhausted embrace
Now I wander in Your glorious maze
Lost in grace, lost in grace

I don’t want to escape
Enchanted, amazed
Wherever I go
No need for control

At Your cross held my exhausted embrace
Now I wander in Your glorious maze
Lost in grace, lost in grace

I’m in over my head, wrapped in light
Tapestries of wonder fill my eyes
Running under rainbows, so alive

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I've come
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed his precious blood

Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy grace now like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh, take it seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ
