I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’

It’s been a long week
I’ve been missin’ me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine
Girl if you only knew, hey

I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Yeah keep ‘em comin’ all night

Don’t stop killin’ me baby
Don’t stop drivin’ me crazy
I swear there’s honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss

I can’t imagine doin’ nothin but what I’m doin
Just layin’ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippin’ on a little something
I need your lovin’
Just keep them kisses comin’
Oh keep ‘em comin’ all night, 

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

After that that's all she wanted to do
But that was okay cause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ain't bitin' she don't give up
Turns out my baby loves to...

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish

I love to see her silhouette reflectin' off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
Cause I found a girl who loves to...

Fish, I love to see her lyin'
There on the bank neath the full moon light
Man, I can't even believe my luck
I found a girl who loves to...

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
Yeah, I know she loves to fish

Psst, you awake, let's go

Thought I might go fishin?, then I thought again
Hell I don't even want to have to reel one in
So I pulled my old truck down here in the shade
Spread my jacket out on the tailgate
I've been lying here just drifting away

Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Right now I feel like that old groundhog
Chewin' on a blade of grass underneath that log
Lettin' the world go by without a care at all

Chillaxin' with my boot heals kicked up
Cat nappin' between beers and dips of snuff
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol? straw hat
Chillaxin'

Cat nappin'
It's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol' straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah it's a hell of a way to waste a whole day
No worries, no distractions
Layed on back beneath this ol? straw hat
Chillaxin'
Yeah
