Uh, deep shit blueberry bacon. 

Deep shit?

Ye- uh, dish! Deep dish. Sorry, Cal!

C'mon, girl. 

The day starts like the rest we've seen
Another carbon copy of an old routine

Days keep coming

One out, one in

They keep coming

And make the coffee strong enough to chew!

I don't know what I wish I had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
We've got too much to do

Too much to do

All these same things
We're always
Opening up
Letting the day in
Over a cup
We'll say "Hello, how ya been?"
Looking around
Seeing the same things
Every day brings
"Hello, (Hello) how ya been? (How ya been?)"
"Thank you (Thank you), come again! (Come again)"
Some things never change (Some things never change)

I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But I been 'round the block and just came back again
A small town like ours ain't much

Order up!

Ordered up is how the day will find me
Everything in its place and time
And I like the way most of the days
Look exactly the same (It's just all the same)

Order up!

Check the clock
Tick, tick, tock

Don't stop!
Serve with a smile!

Hurry up, fill the coffee cup
And then in a while
Take a breath when you need
To be reminded that with days like these
We can only do the best we can
'Til we do it again
Come on, move it now!

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe
And bake from the heart
Sugar
And butter
And flour
And mother
What's inside?
Everyone wants to know what's inside
And I always tell them
But I feel more than words can say
You wanna know what's inside?
Simple question, so then what's the answer?
My whole life is in here
In this kitchen baking
What a mess I'm makingSee Jessie Mueller LiveGet tickets as low as $89You might also
