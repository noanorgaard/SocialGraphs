Sirah diz
Curtindo em Kyoto com o meu homem Skrill
Fumando nicotina, digo foda-se rápido
Temos essa garota branca então fazemos as checagens do Skrill
Foda uma garota branca, eu irei dar um karatê em seu pescoço, arrancarei seus dentes
Vadia, eu mato, nascida do centro da tempestade
Todos esses garotos se quebrando dizendo como eles são durões
Vadia, eu sou mais, ser um mártir até o estilo na esquina
Bata em sua garota com a bateria enquanto a batida faz еssa vadia gozar


Batida faz essa vadia gozar
