I'll (Fly away) fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away (In the mornin')
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll (Fly away) fly away


When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars I've flown
I'll (Fly away) fly away

I'll (Fly away) fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away (In the mornin')
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll (Fly away) fly away
You might also like

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll (Fly away) fly away

I'll (Fly away) fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away (In the mornin')
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll (Fly away) fly away
I'll (Fly away) fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away (In the mornin')
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll (Fly away) fly
