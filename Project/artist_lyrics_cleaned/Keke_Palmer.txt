(Laugh)
Alright y'all
It's Keke P, huh I'm flappin'
'07 We doin' a real beat
Woke up in the Morning
And I see the sunshine
Only got the summer time
On my mind (Ohh)
My girls' in here and
We kick it all the time
Only got the summer time
On my mind (ehh)
We keep it movin' (oh ayo) (eh oh)
We keep it movin' (Oh weh oh)
We keep it movin' (Ohh, ooh oh, ooh oh)
Everybody knows that school's out
No doubt
You know this one goes out
To all of my homies
It's what we been waitin' for
It's how you do
Let's make our move
And get into a little somethin'
You might also likeRadio's blastin'

Homies and shorties
Stand up (stand up)

Let's do this now
Be young and proud
Show 'em how we hold it down

So don't be afraid to loose control
It's all about you
Do what it do
Can't nobody tell us nothin'

Homies and shorties
Stand up (stand up!)
Let's get this party on

A couple months beatin' by like a hot car
Cause time flies when u havin' fun
