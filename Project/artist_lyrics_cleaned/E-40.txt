And ready to mob, so get the fuck up out of Dodge
Before I trip, and slap yo' ass with this new grip
One slip of the tongue'll get your monkey ass hung
Two lungs is what it takes to inhale the dank
And one cap is all it takes to put you in the paint

So beware, to stare, in the glare, of this infrared
You dread the day we pull out the Glock display
One way, is what your headed down, we got the pound
So bow down, and give me the ball because we on the mound

With intentions of splittin my wig but it wound up gettin reversed

Uhh, uhh (What, 

What's the subject? Fo' brings niggas they Kotex
Where we reside I creeps my ass up inside
And smash these brownies off in his FACE
That I done shitted and pissed on, dude, HOW THAT TASTE
Catch him out his place, out of his area
With his nephew and his niece, ooh, the more the merrier
Nigga tried to fuck mines off (what'd he do?)
Tried to gauge the porch with my broads on Watoo
Dude you done broke fuckin code
I'm finst ta dump drop clip, dump-drop-clip reload
Be like I can motherfuckin explode
Talkin about I'll be fuckin all kind of women
That's B-R-P, Blade Run or Pimpin
Once upon a time there was this guy named Dane
Tried to fuck my bitch, but he Kris-Krossed game
I don't owe this motherfucker in the first
But he done made livin in my house a whole lot worse
Tryin to gain some stripes

It's nothin nice -- READ HIM HIS RIGHTS
Collar him and laugh, rollin over and politickin with the vice
Crackin under pressure, bust a pipe

Laid back and watch him misprint it, we been spit it

Pay attention, this one with extension, big boots with the gloves
Seems she's lookin for love
Spent a dub at the bar with her, see I promised not to hit her
Long as I can get her
To the floor fashion show, short skirt and high heels
So the ass can show, satisfaction
Action make her ask for mo', gettin dough
Don't need no ho that's po', you know?
You'd rather blow fo' with the snowbunny, well I ain't mad
Cause the ho money mo' money, sweet as snow money
Bring it to a pimp so he maintain wealth
Forty G's on the yacht, I got cock for sale
Might bail to Miami, nine hoes deep
Red Bull in my bag hoes get no sleep
Gators on my feet, I talk shit you know
On how everything here is a ho

Smell, smell, Char-lie
Smell, smell, smell me
Smell, smell, the cheezie
Smell, smell, smell away
You can't make a tramp a champ even if you put her on a stamp
That bitch still wouldn't be worth a cryin dime
A blue nickel, or a screamin quarter
40-Water put it in order
Bitch it's about CB&H and I ain't talkin about pure cane sugar
I'm talkin about cock a butt and HEAD
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head

Uhh, you're 'posed to, you're 'posed to
Play that damn game like it's supposed to be plinayed
Always keep a bucket full of battery acid
To throw yo' dope in just in case they raid
That way they can't prosecute your residence
Cause you done been already got rid of all the evidence
Tryin to get a BUCK -- a BUCK?
A soup pot, a blender and a measurin cup
In my section eight appartment COMPLEX
Pissy MATTRESS, and dirty CARPETS
"Nephew, did you get my message?"
Yeah I got yo' message; you told me to clean up behind myself
And scrape the residue up off the edges
"What else?" Always look over my headrest and my rearview zone
Cause triflin be skanless and the skanless might try to follow me home
Never tell a motherfucker what time you gon' cop or come back through
Throw they ass off a bit - come back within the next day or two
I don't need no cowards, just warriors on my team
I don't sell coke no more dude, I sell mescaline
Regulation #5: when it's a drought nigga park yo' feet

Chorus

BLOWED, pushin numbers on the dial-tone
Took a swig of my 40 but I forgot I had the cap still on
Look to my left and asked, honey for a light
She looked at me and said, baby you alright?
I said I'm cool, but ain't this shit supposed to relax us?
Fired up a Newport, but I accidentally lit it backwards
For some strange reason I had a feelin
That that hood-ho bitch was sneaky
Come to find out this bitch done laced my weed and slipped me a mickey
Now I'm feelin sweaty..
Eyelids gettin heavy..
Stomach feelin queasy.. {*YAWWWWN*}
All of a sudden, now I'm slee-py
Woke up naked, slowly regainin my memory
Well where did they find you? Around the corner from Applebee
Over there by Costco, right there off the freeway
Admiral Callaghan Lane, yeah! Right next door to Safeway
Stripped me clean, got me for some G's
Set me up, stole my car keys
Guess that's the consequences when you sellin that D
Shit, next time I bet I take my drink to the bathroom with me
Regulation #9: checking those that get out of line
