Leave me be
I'll give you roses and violets
If you stop inflicting violence on me

Forgive my cancerous emotions
Here I offer these devotions to appease
Now please - da tik'bit
Filter out of me
So I can drown out this supernatural scream

Batonebo, Batonebo
Set me free
I'll sing you iavnana vardo batonebo

Batonebo, Batonebo (Batonebo, Batonebo)
Leave me be (Leave me be)
I'll give you roses and violets (I'll give you roses and violets)

When I was a sweet little girl and I'd go to sleep
See a man standing in my doorway
Say, brother won't you let me be?

When I was a sweet little child
I had visions visit in the night
They'd follow me down to the tunnels underground
I burrowed them all in my mind

Come, come my child
I'm taking you to be with your kind
Close, close your eyes
You never know what you won't
Never know what you might
Never know what you won't find
Aaaaaaaa!
Aaaaaaaa!
Aa!You might also
