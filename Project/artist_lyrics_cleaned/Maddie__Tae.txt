Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' 
Sayin', "Hey, girl" (Hey, girl)
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't "Pretty little thing"
"Hottie" or "Baby"
Yeah, it's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy

Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time "You gotta get you some of that"
Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that

Now we're lucky if we even get

(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady

Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)
I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw (

He pulled up in his red Corvette
Salmon shorts and a white V-neck
I said "Wow, you know how
To dress down for a city guy"

We headed out to a spot on the lake
A couple Zebcos and a cup full of bait
I could tell pretty fast he had more than just bass on his mind
Oh, I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Crowdin' up my castin' shoulder
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And sayin' I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish

For a little while he calmed down and let up
But then he went right back to pushing his luck
And that line of mine wasn't all I wanted to throw in
Oh no

I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Crowdin' up my castin' shoulder
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And saying I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish
Come on

I finally had all of him that I could take
So I gave him a cold shower in the lake
What can I say (Say)?

I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Playin' Captain Casanova
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And saying I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Just a little push
'Cause he couldn't just
Shut up and fish
Shut up and
