You don't ask for no diamond rings
No delicate strings of pearls

I wish I could do better by you
Cause that's what you deserve
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work
While I'm off chasing my own dreams

Fulfill someone else's dreams
I think I might totally be lost

But you don't ask for no diamond ring (Diamond ring)
No delicate string of pearls (String of pearls)
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl

Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
Ooooo ooo ohhh ohh oh oh
But you don't ask for no diamond ring (Diamond ring)
No delicate string of pearls (String of pearls)
That's why I wrote this song to sing
My beautiful girl (My beautiful girl)
