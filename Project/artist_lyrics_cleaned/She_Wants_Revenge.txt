It's cute in a way 'til you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette and knees get weak
Escape was just a nod and a casual wave
Obsess about it heavy for the next two days
It's only just a crush, it'll go away
It's just like all the others, it'll go away
Or maybe this is danger, and he just don't know
You pray it all away, but it continues to grow

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, "I wanna fucking tear you apart"

Then he walked up and told her, thinking maybe it'd pass
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare
They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do?
'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

Either way, he wanted her, and this was bad
Wanted to do things to her, it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, "I wanna fucking tear you apart"

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then we'll
Turn off all the lights

First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks
You might also like
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he anwers
Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And the Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town
He'll be so pleased with our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And to stay on his good side
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then we'll throw away the
