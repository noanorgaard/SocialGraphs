Numero uno, I don't fuck with anybody, I gave you my soul cuz I'm fucking wit you though
Never in love, steady be kicking shit like I was practicing judo
Always be tweaking,I take off to Mars like my middle name is Bruno
Today I might go up to pluto,it's Time to get high and you know
Take the Percocet and pray to God, I'm gon be alright
Life was moving fast,I took the pill so I could stop time
Feeling like I could see everything cuz of my third eye
But I can't see the moon again, but I can feel the spotlight
Smoking all the green,it made me go and look for stop signs
Smoking on the Colorado,I can't see my phone right
Walked up to my father, asking him if I'll be alright, yeah
Now I'm just hallucinating cuz I know my pops died
You might also like#CHORUS
Why? I gave you my heart and now you're leaving me to die (yeah)
I never imagined that you'll ever leave my side
I don't fuck with love again cuz you fucked up my mind
You fucked up my mind, you fucked up my mind
I gave you my heart and now you're leaving me to die
I never imagined that you'll ever leave my side
I don't fuck with love again cuz you fucked up my mind (Hella downfalls)
You fucked up my mind, you fucked up my mind
#VERSE
Sipping till my heart stops, and my Jaw locked
Smoking till my eyes rolled back, yeah I'm fucked up
Listen to my story (yeah) Hella downfalls
So what!? 50k a show, I don't show up
Love me when the time's right, Cocaine turn to White Line, yeah
Lately I've been in my feelings listening to White Wine
Sleeping on her timeline, Sipping too much
Damn it , now my jaw locked, you done fucked up
Sad Souls, with some Cash Flow
Never gave a fuck about her past whoa
Uhh, Music a misery, Fucking me up mentally
Is that where I'm meant to be? (Is that where I'm meant to be?) Yeah
#CHORUS
