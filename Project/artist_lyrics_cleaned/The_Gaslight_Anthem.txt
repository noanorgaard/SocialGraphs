'Cause the chains I been hearing now for most of my life
And the chains I been hearing now for most of my life

Did you hear the '59 Sound coming through on Grandmama's radio?
Did you hear the rattling chains in the hospital walls?
Did you hear the old gospel choir when they came to carry you over?
Did you hear your favorite song one last time?

And I wonder, were you scared when the metal hit the glass?
See, I was playing a show down the road when your spirit left your body
And they told me on the front lawn, I'm sorry I couldn't go
But I still know the song and the words and her name and the reasons

And I know 'cause we were kids and we used to hang
And I know 'cause we were kids and we used to hang
