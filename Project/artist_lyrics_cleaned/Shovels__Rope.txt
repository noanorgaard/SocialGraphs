Raised their Cumberland daughter in a Tennessee band
Played Springwater at Station Inn
Couldn't play fast, couldn't fit in
Caught a '66 Dodge in Caroline
Got her education on her mama's dime
She was singing in a bar called Comatose
Halfway rusted on the salty coast
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Buried in the sand
Five hundred miles from Birmingham
Rockamount Cowboy in a rock and roll band
Plugged his amplifier in all across the land
Athens, Georgia on a Friday night
Saw that little girl, she could sing alright
Spent five years going from town to town
Waiting on that little girl to come around
Caught in the arms of New York City
To lose that gal seemed a terrible pity
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let my heart forget a beat
Why do you demand
Calling me from Birmingham

Said "This'll be the last you'll ever see of me."
Well the cowboy laughed said "I know it's not true
Cause there's nothing I could do to get loose from you."
Made a little money playing in the bars
With two beat up drums and two old guitars
From the Crescent City to the Great Salt Lake
It ain't what you got, it's what you make
When the road got rough and the wheels all broke
Couldn't take more then we could tow
Making something out of nothing with a scratcher and our hope
With two old guitars like a shovel and a rope
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Now I understand
On better terms since 

So lay low
Baby
I won't be back anytime soon
If it gets too lonely
I will follow you around in this tune
I don't know what to do
What I'd do if I knew
But we go through our day
And get by, and get through
But my heart is with you
You probably knew your love is like glue

Just for a little while more

I will find my way back to your 

O' be joyful!
Is that what you're brewing?
Does your daddy know that's what you're doing?
His little girl's got a reputation now for ruin
She was givin' them the country way

Machete in the tree stump, hound dog on the chain
Wooden-legged woman playin' a banjo in the rain
Can't recall the tune, but the song's always the same:
"Jesus, give me strength."

But babe, it's alright
I'm gonna wrap you up tonight
Carry you out right on time

Well she got Comanche, she got Iroquois
She got a young man that she plays with like a toy
He don't mind when she call him "Little Boy"
That's a thing that he enjoys
You might also like
She wants to give it all back but it's a little too late
He want to start all over, want a shiny clean slate
She'll skin him like a snake, and hang him up over the gate
Don't believe it?
Just you wait

But babe, it's alright
I'm gonna wrap you up tonight
Carry you out right on time
Hey, alright
Ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't it nice to be fightin' on the winnin' side?

Now he's turning up his amplifier, staring at his toes
Even when he's looking at you, he's still looking down his nose
Sounds like surf music maybe more than just a little
But to me it's just another form of California dribble
Keep the top and bottom straight and keep it shaky in the middle

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a country singer, I'm a cavalier

Well I wanna know the whole story over
Where you came from, where you going
However long it takes to know you
With your heavy metal heartbeat
Salty but you seem sweet
Tippy toes on both feet
Rockin' to the teen beat
You might also like
Well, ice cream, soda pop, bourbon on top
Some people call it rock and roll, and some people call it pop
Sounds like country music every time you use a fiddle
How am I supposed to know if that's a fact or just a riddle?
Keep tight around the edges, leave a little room to wiggle

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a country singer, I'm a cavalier
Oh

Well there's something to be learned here
Though it may seem a little insincere
Like a cruel clown grinning ear to ear
You're a psycho killer, I'm a
