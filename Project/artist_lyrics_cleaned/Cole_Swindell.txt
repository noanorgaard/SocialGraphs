In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
(You should be here)

You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone
Showin' 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face

But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right
