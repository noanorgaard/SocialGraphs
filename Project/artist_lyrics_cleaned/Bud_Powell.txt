And we both stood amazed as he hung each star that night
We laughed as we danced through the clouds
But we didn't want to be to loud
Cause father was workin
I love to see you workin
I remember when you said soon we'll be more than friends
That soon you'll have the power to forgive all my sins
But first you had to leave
And then you will return for me
After you were workin
But right now you were workin
There will never be another you
You are royalty
King of kings
Still you know my name
You sit high above
The galaxies
But hear each word i pray
Though you're robed in majesty
You promised you'll still be
You'll be my big, big brother 
You're my savior and my king but you still make time to be my big, big brother
When i was a youngin makin friends was hard for me
And being your brother sometimes made enemies
But whenever i call your name
Like a hero you saved the day
Thank you for workin
For me you're always workin
You are royalty
King of kings
Still you know my name
You sit high above
The galaxies
But hear each word i pray
Though you're robed in majesty
You promised you'll still be
You'll be my big, big brother 
You're my savior and my king but you still make time to be my big, big brothe
Oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
It was a cold Friday when they killed mt best friend
I can still feel the wind as the nails they pierced your skin
My brother, my leader, my king, dying in place of me
Cause God was workin, was hard to see you workin
But in three days there'll be no one like you
You are royalty
King of kings
Still you know my name
You sit high above
The galaxies
But hear each word i pray
Though you're robed in majesty
You promised you'll still be
You'll be my big, big brother 
You're my savior and my king but you still make time to be my big, big brotherYou might also
