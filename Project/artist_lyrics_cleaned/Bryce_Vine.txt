I don’t wanna worry bout nothin for a while, I just wanna play around livin’ like a child
With old tunes jammin on my Walkman, and some Sour Patch Kids and a Coke can
I don’t wanna think about anything at all, I just wanna run around doin what I want
With a pretty ass girl and a slow jam, and some Sour Patch Kids and a Coke can

I just wanna go back to the old school, old news, road rules, fresh prince, cartoons, good raps, dope tracks
I’m not tryin to be on it, I’m just tryin’ to be honest
Packed lunch, school crush, Bus home and play Sonic
I have been there, I have done that, made my mark up on the town
Been stupid, I’ve been lucid, been a menace and a clown
Wow, I’m chillin watchin’ Rocko’s modern livin’ wishin I could find a way to bring back Music Television
No more Jersey Shore’n whorin’ or horribly borin’ versions of shows from Great Britain, they’re written with no vision
Damn, so fuck it I’ll be right back
Pay my tribute to the past, you can all just kiss my ass for a second
