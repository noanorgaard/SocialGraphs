Me and my niggas be rollin', schemin' on you and your homies
The very first day of summer, all chromed out in a Hummer, babe
Hit the park and parlay, hope that you walk this way
Do you and your girls wanna ride, play all day, puff on the lye?

Ooh, say what? Say what? Say what? (You know that I like it, baby)
Ooh, girl, you know what's up (And you know what I need)
Ooh, say what? Say what? Say what? (You know that I'm 'bout it, baby)
Ooh, girl, you know what's up (Mmh)

I'm diggin' you (Baby), I'm feelin' you
And you know what's up (You gotta know what's up, baby)
Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wantin' you
So tell me, what's up? (So tell me, what's up, baby?)

Peep her thighs and I'm zonin' right around two in the mornin'
Lookin' fly with the sun dress on, I think I feel a bone comin' on
Girl, you got me wide open, waitin' all day and I'm hopin'
So, baby, don't front, backseat Jeep, you know what I want
