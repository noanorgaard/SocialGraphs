If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
You might also like
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', 

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Just the same way you showed me, showed me

You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love (Ah)
Glory from above
Regard, my dear (Ah)
It's all downhill from here

Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles

I think I started something
I got what I wanted, did-didn't I?
Can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z-Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice-cold lawn
She handed me a ice-blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you working

But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking, anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste, a little taste of…

Novocaine, baby, baby
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, how-how
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since, I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smoking, anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste, a little taste of…

Novocaine, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine
I can't feel, feel her
Novocaine for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
