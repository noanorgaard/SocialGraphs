Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance
I've learned to make it all a part of my plans
It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away from a good time

We were cutting it up, and telling some jokes
Talking NASCAR and UFOs, that chainlink fence don't keep out much
The rest of the block started showing on up, ran outta charcoal
Went to the store, they were running a deal on cases of Coors
If you bought one it was regular price
But if you bought two you got a free bag of ice
Hell so I bought four, and it made me grin
I was walking out, pretty girls walking in
You could say the stars just lined up right
But it ain't luck man it's just my life

Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance

It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away from a good time

I guess that old truck's gonna wait another day
Maybe two or three keeps going this way, ah but I don't care
Say what you want, man we only get to live it up once

Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance
Turned down drinking
Turned down a dance
It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away
I just can't get away
I can't get away
From a good time
I just can't get away

1 ContributorEl Camino Lyrics
Let's have a party in my El Camino
You bring the birds and baby I'll bring the bees
We can blow this town or go get pumped on a backroad
We'll get to rocking if you know what I mean
I got a mixtape with the best of Lucero
Let's have a party in my El Camino

I know your daddy tells you I'm no good
Worried that you'll pop the hood, like what I got underneath
But girl, he's just jealous of me
Can't handle the fact that I can smoke his Ranchero

Let's have a party in my El Camino
No need to wait until the end of the work day
Let's burn some rubber I can't take it no more
They're used to me not coming back after lunch break
Do they really need a greeter at the Walmart door?
Gotta get my money's worth before it gets repossessed-o
Let's have a party in my El Camino

I know your daddy tells you I'm no good
Worried that you'll pop the hood, like what I got underneath
But girl, he's just jealous of me
Can't handle the fact that I can smoke his Ranchero

Yeah, don't worry bout your boyfriend
No, he don't have to know
La la la bamba baby, have I convinced you?
You need to hurry up and make up your mind
I packed a picnic basket of tacos just in queso
And you're driving me loco, so senorita, you're fine
It's me talkin' dirty, in my best Espanol
Let's have a party in my El Camino

I know your daddy tells you I'm no good
Worried that you'll pop the hood, like what I got underneath
But girl, he's just jealous of me
Can't handle the fact that I can smoke his Ranchero

Let's have a party in my El Camino
Don't let some pretty boy talk you into his jacked up Silverado
Let's have a party in my

It's where you're from, baby, where you're goin'
When you're slow and easy, when you're rock 'n' rollin'
Like to raise a little hell, love your God in heaven
Red and white and blue and lucky sevens
You're heavy on the gas, little hard to handle
Wearing mama's smile and daddy's flannel
You're thinking every cloud has got a silver lining
How you point it out so I can find it too
That's what I love about you

How you light up the room with the way that it sounds
When you laugh like a kid on a merry go round
The man that you made of the man that you found
Girl, that's what I love about you
