You know me
I try to find some good in everything
Since you came along, somehow this got easy
'Cause all you wanna do is please me, my love

This is could be a rollercoaster
But we're gonna make the most of it
Whether on top or we're going down
You know me

You know me, I know you
And how I get when I'm uncomfortable
If I'm too hot or cold, tired, bored or hungry
I'm fine when you're around me, boy

And you know me
I've never been on time for anything
I do apologize, I know it's such a bother
I promise to try harder for you, girl, I will

This is a risk worth taking, this is love in the making
We got nothing up our sleeves
We got an understanding, I don't think we could've planned it better
I know cause you know, you know me

You know me, you know me
I work too much, I'm always on the run
And I know it's only just begun, you know how hard it can be
To go on chasing something, there's good amounts of nothing when it's all said and done

I think you can make me better, I'm looking ahead, but I'll never
Get anything that help me see
That if you could be proud of me and proud of yourself 'cause you got me
And we know, yeah, we both know you know me

And I'll never hurt you, darling, you know damn well
And I'll never make you wonder if the things I tell you ain't the honest truth
I've had a lot of folks singing how I've been mean
Yeah, no one will ever know me like you know me
You know 

Ooh, I'm gonna miss something
If I keep bumping the most significant stuff
All my friends and all the loose ends
And this love of mine 'cause I'm running out of time
Who am I? Am I still the same guy?
Or have I lost something as I keep stomping?
Mind and health, every bit of myself
I ignore the signs as I'm running out of time

A year goes by you wonder why not much is done
You blew right past your precious time with everyone
You've run too much in parallel
Now hurry, hurry is your hell
The output is what you put in, and it ain't enough
If you're not focused on the most important stuff
Then all that you've got left to show
Is hurry, hurry on the go

Ooh, I'm gonna miss something
If I keep bumping the most significant stuff
All my friends and all the loose ends
And this love of mine 'cause I'm running out of time
Who am I? Am I still the same guy?
Or have I lost something as I keep stomping?
Mind and health, every bit of myself
I ignore the signs as I'm running out of time
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)

Hurried through these crowded streets, and I
Hurried through the food I eat, and I
Hurried when it's time to learn, and why?
How many good people have I burned?
I hurried when I should've been in the zone
I hurried my loved ones off the phone
I hurried through sex, I know, I know
I hurried my quiet time alone

In bed I lie, good place to die, I did my best
Never relaxed, my heart attacks my little chest
I stop to smell the roses
My body decomposes

Ooh, I'm gonna miss something
If I keep bumping the most significant stuff
All my friends and all the loose ends
And this love of mine 'cause I'm running out of time
Who am I? Am I still the same guy?
Or have I lost something as I keep stomping?
Mind and health, every bit of myself
I ignore the signs as I'm running out of time
Ooh, I'm gonna miss something
If I keep bumping the most significant stuff
All my friends and all the loose ends
And this love of mine 'cause I'm running out of time
Who am I? Am I still the same guy?
Or have I lost something as I keep stomping?
Mind and health, every bit of myself
I ignore the signs as I'm running out of time

Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
Hurry, hurry (Whoa)
