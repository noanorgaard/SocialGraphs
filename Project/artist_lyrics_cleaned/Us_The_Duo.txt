But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, It's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
You might also like
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, It's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Heart-breakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it
