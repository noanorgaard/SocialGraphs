This is an emergency

There are tears from the saints
For the lost and unsaved
We're crying for them, "Come back home"
We're crying for them, "Come back home"
And all Your children will stretch out their hands
And pick up the crippled man
Father, we will lead them home
Father, we will lead them home

There are schools full of hatred
Even churches have forsaken
Love and mercy
May we see this generation
In it's state of desperation
For Your glory
You might also like
This is an emergency

There are tears from the saints
For the lost and unsaved
We're crying for them, "Come back home"
We're crying for them, "Come back home"
And all Your children will stretch out their hands
And pick up the crippled man
Father, we will lead them home
Father, we will lead them homeL

Sinner, reach out your hands
Children, in Christ you stand
Sinner, reach out your hands
Children, in Christ you stand

And all Your children will stretch out their hands
And pick up the crippled man
Father, we will lead them home
Father, we will lead them
