To be fly as a mother (Hey)
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right (Hey)
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em (Hey)
But I hope they all come out tonight (Hey)

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother (Hey)
To supply all of my heart's demands (Hey)
Suit and tie, 'cause undercover (Hey)
He's gonna save my life like Superman (Hey)

I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh, I don't know what you been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9-to-5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had seven men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for
