Driving back
Thought that you’d be waiting at home
Thought that you were big enough
To at least write me a note
Ever since they know my name
You’ve been so weary about folks
Thought that we were big enough
Not to be divided by talk

Why were we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault
Why are we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault

Called your phone
Ain't the same number no more
And I got some things
Just some things you should know
Ever since they know my name
You’ve been so weary about faults
Thought that we were big enough
You might also likeNot to be divided by talk
Tell me what I should have said?
Tell me what I should have did?

Why were we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault
Why are we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault
We divided
We divided
We divided
We divided
We divided
We divided
We divided
We divided

What is love?
What is this I’m feeling right now?
Maybe you’re my drug
And I’m fiendin right now
Why were we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault
Why are we divided at all?
It’s like we’ve been divided by fault
Tell me what I should have said?
Tell me what I should have did?
We divided
We divided
We divided

I've should've seen it
You're always creeping late at night
You say you'll leave him
But you're forever by his side
I love you then I hate you
I can't make up my mind
And if you're choosing him, love
I believe that's fine


For no good reason
I want to look you in the eyes
I tried to see you
The same procedure everytime
You love me, then you hate me
You can't make up your mind
But if you're choosing me, love
You're running out of time

I'll bet you miss me
It's not the same between your thighs
In case you're listening
Please pack your shit and say goodbye
