I want to swim away, but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up, take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
(Goodbye, goodbye)
Let the rain come down (Goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye)

Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk would do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life, believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?
I thought of just your face
Relaxed and floated into space

I want to swim away, but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up, take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow, yeah
Just to prove that I knew how, yeah
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)

I want to swim away, but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up, take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
(Into space)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (Goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
(I thought of just your face)
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it
