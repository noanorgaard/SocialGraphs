We had our hearts lost
Getting our hair caught and teeth cut
Starting up wildfires
Making the Earth move around us
And in a landslide make tracks
Turning the hills inside out
We draw the first blood
Now that you've let us all too far

Into your heart (x9)
Oh into your heart (x9)

Come unkinder, moving, facing us
Come alive at night and bring us, bring us up
Come unkinder, shake the building into piles
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher love (unkinder)
Come unkinder, moving facing us
We can light the towers up and tie the wires
Come unkinder, moving closer, bring us up
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher, tougher love (unkinder)

We let our nights run
We let them stream into our days
Come to immerse us
And tie us together, eight ways
Blood in our arms through too fast
Filling us out past life-sized
We make the earth move
Now that you've let us all too far

Into your heart (x9)
Oh into your heart (x9)

Come unkinder, moving, facing us
Come alive at night and bring us, bring us up
Come unkinder, shake the building into piles
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher love (unkinder)
Come unkinder, moving, facing us
We can light the towers up and tie the wires
Come unkinder, moving closer, bring us up
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher, tougher love (unkinder)

Come unkinder, moving, facing us
Come alive at night and bring us, bring us up
Come unkinder, shake the building into piles
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher love (unkinder)
Come unkinder, moving, facing us
We can light the towers up and tie the wires
Come unkinder, moving closer, bring us up
Come unkinder, making eyes, a tougher, tougher love

(A tougher, tougher, tougher, tougher love)
