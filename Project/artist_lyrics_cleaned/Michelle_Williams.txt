You know I've had my share of ups and downs
You live and learn, this world keeps on turnin' round
Sometimes, those rainy days seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page and move on (And move on)
Been lonely for the days we used to sit here talkin' all through the night
I'm tryin' to keep my spirits high so I can walk in (Into your light)
Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're a teen
Now, it seems like everything's so far away
Then, one day, you know

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you'll never break your promises

I thank you Lord, I thank you now
'Cause everybody needs (Needs)
Somebody standin' by their side
You look at the road, it gets rough
Still, you say to yourself, "Gotta drive"
Now, I'm ready for the fight (For the fight)
Send a little help, let your angels fly (Fly)
Heard the words deep down inside, I will survive
I'm stronger, 'cause I

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you'll never break your promises

You promise me you'd love me (Love me)
You promise me you'd bless me (Bless me)
You said to me that on your shoulder, I could cry
And if I did, you'd dry my eyes and hold me
I'm so glad that you took all the hurt away (Took all the hurt away)
Warmed me up inside (Whoa)
So glad that you never break your promises
You got me singing
La, da-da, da-da
Oh, oh
Singin' la, da-da, da-da
Oh, oh, ooh
You took
You took my hurt away (Took all the hurt away)
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you never break your promises
Ooh, oh, oh

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word (I heard a word)
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day (Warmed me up inside)
Yes, you did
So glad, so glad, so glad, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I heard a word (Oh, oh, oh)
I heard a word (I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
Listen, you took, you took all my hurt 

I heard a story
Somebody told me of three different women
Long ago
One wasn’t worthy
One was just thirsty
One had tried everything
To stop all the hurting
Then they met a man who would hold the key
To erase the past
And change everything
Freed by his glory
Three different stories
And somehow I still see me

When he speaks a word the chains are broken
And she who the son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
But I want to be free, free me
Standing on your word, my arms wide open
And she who the son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
Now I am free, free me

How did I get here?
Where did I lose it?
I’m having trouble letting go
It’s hard to forget him
He’s done so much damage
How can I forgive him now?
But I met someone with that kind of love
And he held me close
And I’m completely freed by his glory
This is my story now

When he speaks a word the chains are broken
And she who the Son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
But I want to be free, free me
Standing on your word, my arms wide open
And she who the Son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
Now I am free, free me

Do it today, cause yesterday is gone
But tomorrow the sun will shine again
Lord we need from you, your presence
To heal us, to heal us all. That is all
I don’t know long you struggled this way
You don’t have to any longer you can be changed
Desperate for someone to set you free
And I know that God will
When he speaks a word the chains are broken
And she who the son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
But I want to be free, free me
Standing on your word, my arms wide open
And she who the son sets free, is free indeed
She’s free indeed
Now I am free, free me

This one is free! (La la la la la)
This one is free! (La la la la la)
This one is free! (La la la la
