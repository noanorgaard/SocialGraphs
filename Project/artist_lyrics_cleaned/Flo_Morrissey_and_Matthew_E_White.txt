Land and water and bird or beast, oh
Look at what the light did now
Shiny little band or golden fleece, oh
Look at what the light did now

Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now

Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do
Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do

In my will I went 'till it's wasted
Look at what the light did now
Taste the taste I taste 'till it's tasted
Look at what the light did now
Bought it like a boast that burly beaming
Look at what the light did now
Got it like a ghost that girly gleaming
Look at what the light did now

Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now

Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do
Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do

Like a dead tree that's dry and leaving
Look at what the light did now
Play it on me with grief and grieving
Look at what the light did now, Flo

I would finally fall to pieces
Look at what the light did now
We'll meet soon as nephew's nieces
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now
Look at what the light did now

Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do
Do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do, do-ru-do,
