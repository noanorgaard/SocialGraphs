Shit is fucked up
It's a short life
So fill my cup up baby bring me more ice
See you only live once
But I heard ya die twice
Earn your respect coming at a high price
Burn through your checks spend it all in the night
Learn from regret bet it all on the dice
Open up prometh pour it all in the sprite
I turn down a check bet it all on the mic
I been looking for the light

So fill my cup up baby bring me more ice
See you only live once
But I heard ya die twice

I been lookin' for the light
Pass me the bud brody
Smoked out Buick regal with my blood homies
Chiefing in the Cadilac with my crip homies
Crack a bottle of the heen take a sip homie
Zip on me, clip on me, when I'm outside
Eyes wide weed smoke make my mouth dry
Alki summertime give me butterflys
High in the middle of July
When my brother died
East side drug dealers in the Foreign ride
DMT doors open from the other side
West side bank hood is gettin' televised
Young niggas makin' millions off of credit cards
South side all my niggas put ya hood up
If ya floatin' in the coupe or a good truck
Tryna make it out the hood brody good luck
Dice game get killed for a few bucks
Shit is fucked up
It's a short life
So fill my cup up baby bring me more ice
See you only live once
But I heard ya die twice
Earn your respect coming at a high price
Burn through your checks spend it all in the night
I been lookin for the light
Light show
Night go
Bright flow
Hi ho, Hi ho, Hi ho
I been lookin for the light
Light show
Night go
Bright flow
Hi ho

Got a Glock in my pants
She can feel it when we dance
I ain't wavin' shit
I reveal it then it blam
Saving all my chips
I'mma spend it with the fam
Money make my palms itch I can feel it in my hands
XJ8 Interior is ten
Breaking down the sweet
I'mma fill it with a gram
Got my CD on repeat
Cause I'm iller than your man
Me and shorty on the beach
Tip Toeing through the sand
Corner store couture
Kush in my cargos
My nigga Jay stay winning at the car shows
Red six four
Malibus, Monte Carlos
Chrome on the floor
Calico in his Tahoe
Walk slow take ya hoes through the condo
Ya baby mama, little sista, and ya aunt know
Porter Ray pretty nigga with the raw flow
We pop remy, rock pennies, and we spark dro
Chillin' in the
