Broken hearts on the city streets, but
I can hear that You’re calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion
Your love makes me want to give my all
Ready, set, go, ready, set, go, oh
So no, I’m not holding back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
I’m ready, set, go, ready, set, go, oh, oh

Can’t stop this clock is counting down, (Down, down)
So many lost waiting to be found (Woah, yeah)

I will go where you’re leading me, God
Reach my hands to the least of these, oh
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Give me the green light, show me the finish line
No more spinning in circles, no more wastin' time
So let it start today, where I flip the switch say
You're my light, I won't fight, I'll go wherever you say
To the top of the highest mountain
To the bottom of every valley
I'll be the spark that turns into the grand finale
This love is somethin' everyone needs to know
Hearts are callin', no more stallin', it's just
Ready set go

Broken hearts on the city streets, but
I can hear that You’re calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
