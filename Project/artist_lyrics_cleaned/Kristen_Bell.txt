I can't wait to meet everyone
What if I meet "the one"?

Tonight, imagine me, gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace (Ooh)
I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

But it's only for today (It's only for today)
It's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)
Tell the guards to open up the gate (The gate)

For the first time in forever (Don't let them in, don't let them see)
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of (Be the good girl you always have to be)
A chance to change my lonely world (Conceal)
A chance to find true love (Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know)
I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way (

I love crazy

All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you

I was thinking the same thing
'Cause, like

I've been searchin' my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party-talkin' or the chocolate fondue

But with you (But with you, I found my place)
I see your face

And it's nothin' like I've ever known before

Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Love is an open door with you (With you), with you (With you)
Love is an open door

I mean it's crazy

What?

We finish each others' sandwiches

That's what I was gonna say

I never met someone

Who thinks so much like me

Jinx, jinx again

Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation

You and I were just meant to be
Say goodbye (Say goodbye)

To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore

Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Life can be so much more with you (With you), with you (With you)
Love is an open door (Door)

Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?

Can I say something even crazier?


Please don't shut me out again, please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
'Cause for the first time in forever
I finally understand
For the first time in forever
We can fix this hand in hand
We can head down this mountain together
You don't have to live in fear
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here

Anna!

Please go back home, your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates

Yeah, but—

I know

You mean well, but leave me be
Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

Actually, we're not

What do you mean, you're not?

I get the feeling you don't know

What do I not know?

Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep snow

What?
You've kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere

Everywhere?

It's okay, you can just unfreeze it!

No, I can't, I—, I don't know how

Sure you can, I know you can!

'Cause for the first time in forever (Oh, I'm such a fool, I can't be free)
You don't have to be afraid (No escape from the storm inside of me)
We can work this out together (I can't control the curse)
We'll reverse the storm you've made (Ohh, Anna, please, you'll only make it worse)
Don't panic (There's so much fear)
We'll make the sun shine bright (You're not safe here)
We can face this thing together (No)
We can change this winter weather (Ah)
And everything will be alright (I 

Okay, bye

Do you wanna build a snowman
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls

Hang in there, Joan

Elsa?

Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "Have courage," and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you, just let me in
We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
