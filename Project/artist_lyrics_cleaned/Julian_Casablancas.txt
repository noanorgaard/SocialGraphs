And you hear, what you want to hear
And they take what they want to take

Don't be sad, won't ever happen like this anymore
So when's it coming? This life's new great movement that I can join
It won't end here, your faith has got to be greater than your fear

Forgive them even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
You are looking for your own voice, but in others
While it hears you, trapped in another dimension
Drop your guard, you don't have to be smart all of the time
I got a mind full of blanks
I need to go somewhere new fast
And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately
No one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh I got music, coming outta my hands and feet and gizzards
You might also like
That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
We're so quick to point out our own flaws in others
Complicated mammals on the wings of robots

If you believe in this world no one has died in vain
But don't you dare get to the top and not know what to
