Aye, I’m feelin’ cool
Tell ‘em that we here. (Aye)
Used to use a stool
Now I’m reaching clear. (Aye)
Had to buckle down
Gotta kill the fear. (Aye)
Turn this mug around
Boy, we really here
(Aye, uh) Really here
Tell ‘em that we really here
(Uh, yeah) Really here
Count it now: we really here
(Aye, yuh) Really here
Coming up: we really here
Yahweh drove: we had to steer
But, now we here, we really here

Whole team is really here
Whole squad been certified
It’s time to kill the fear
We gotta murder pride
Thank God our vision clear
We got it working now
Perfect time, we gon call on God until our service die
Boy, that mug for certain, we outworking those who workin nine, to five
We gotta purpose and our purpose is work for God
I promise we ain’t paying homage to them dollar worshippers
Nah, we take the profit and profit those who hurting by
The system got ‘em really trippin’, they need a turn around
Certified done brought the heat: they swear we need to turn it down
And we got that fire from above, the game we burning down
Man the show is over, camera rollin’: pull the curtains down
We did that mug like too quick
We cruised to undisputed
We did it on the road bruh: that Oleksandr Usyk
That mug was close to lightweight: Terence Crawford movement
Man we undefeated so you know that we ain’t losin’

(Aye, yuh) Really here
Coming up: we really here
Yahweh drove: we had to steer
But, now we here, we really here

(Uh) Tell ‘em that we still here
Blast off: gotta buzz like I’m Lightyear
Souled out for the GOAT, gotta switch gears, and I moonwalk in the valley I don’t feel fear
(Aye) Young Timmo gotta push weight
By weight: I’m referring to the Lord’s grace
By grace: I’m referring to the Lord’s ways
So I’m never tripping, finna preach it ‘til my lungs ache
Cooking, gotta cook with a time limit
King stir, freezer: Where the bars hidden
Straight ice, my veins really God-given
Hoopin’ all year like I’m A. Wiggins
(Yuh yuh) Glory to the true king
Yes sir, can’t dunk but I rim hang
Moving smoothly like I’m Bruce Wayne
Armor of God: what I maintain
(Aye) One and only
Fight the flesh, so I’m kinda boney
Boy, pay respect if you ain’t know me
And it’s His glory that stay on me (Uh)
(Yuh) Flow on wow
No more levels: it’s dimensions now
Gotta thank my momma for the “pow pow”
Cause them whippings hurt me but I praise Him now
So it’s thank you Jesus for my life and cows, Why did I say cows? Cause I love to eat
And if you know me, G, I’m all about the beef
Not division beef, okay where the beat?
Cause I
Bring it back, gotta kill the track
Holy weapon on me go: click clack
But it ain’t no rounds, just the word of God
And I’m bustin’ verses on the devil’s squad (Yee)
Aye, I’m feelin’ cool
Tell ‘em that we here. (Aye)
Used to use a stool
Now I’m reaching clear. (Aye)
Had to buckle down
Gotta kill the fear. (Aye)
