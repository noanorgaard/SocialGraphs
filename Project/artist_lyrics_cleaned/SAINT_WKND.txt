Got me winding down
My strings strung up
I'm blinded by the way you say my name
You got me tight
Hands above my head and I
Not gonna fight you, baby, I can play your game
You keep so cool
You know I want it too

In my room all alone and on my own

And who am I to stop this from happening?

And I know that we are golden
I can feel you getting through and underneath my skin
And I know that we are golden
And with you I don't worry about a thing
And I know that we are golden
I can feel you getting through and underneath my skin
And I know that we are golden
And with you I don't worry about a thing
We are golden
We are golden
We are golden

And I know that we are golden
I can feel you getting through and underneath my skin
And I know that we are golden
And with you I don't worry about a thing
And I know that we are golden
I can feel you getting through and underneath my skin
And I know that we are golden
And with you I don't worry about a
