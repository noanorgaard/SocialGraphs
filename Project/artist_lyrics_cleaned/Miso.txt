Maybe, we need some time to mend this broken trust
I don't want this to end and fade to dust
Baby, we need some time to mend this broken trust
I really want us to start up this trust

20 days and I don't know what pace this is
If I could read your mind, would you notice it?
Discolor all the worries, find the right exit
I promise not to hide, I give you full permit
I'm understanding that you wanna be good friends
A very special timing we can alternate
I'll be right there
Do more than care
You might also like
I know what I want is to speed it up with you
I know I'm a girl, but not the average kind
You're saying all these aimless things, I'm not surprised
But I'm infatuated by the way you smile
I don't need a man to complete me
Strong like a diamond, you can't break me
But you could be my pearl king
I could be your diamond queen

Maybe, we need some time to mend this broken trust
I don't want this to end and fade to dust
Baby, we need some time to mend this broken trust
I really want us to start up this trust

Start up this trust
Focus it on us
Start up this
