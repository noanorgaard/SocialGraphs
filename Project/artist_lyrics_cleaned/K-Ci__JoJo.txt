I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you, baby

I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you lately (crazy baby)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you, baby (I don't know
What to do)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinking about you lately (crazy, crazy
Crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy) when I can't touch you
Crazy, crazy (I'm going crazy) when I can't hold you
Crazy, crazy, (I'm going crazy) when I can't see you again
(Said I'm going crazy)
(Said I'm going crazy)

I've finally realized, that you are my true love
And I had a lot of time to think, and you're all seem to keep thinking
To keep thinking of, yeah
And now I know I need you each and every day
I can't live without you, so don't run away
Baby, you say that you love me, so why'd you leave me? Why? (Why, why, why, why)

I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you, baby (I'm going crazy)

Crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy), when I can't hold you
Crazy, crazy, when I can see again (if I can see you, if I can see you if I can see you, if I can see you)
If I can see you, if I can see you again
Then I would go, if I could see you again
I'd go 

I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you, sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover
More precious than you, more precious than you
(Girl you are) Close to me you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother
You are the only one, my everything
And for you this song I sing

And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I, that I finally found you
'Cause all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
And I hope that you do love me too
