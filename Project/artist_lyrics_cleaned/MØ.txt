Let it all go
Come on, man, I already know
We gotta go dig up a riot
If we wanna fly free (If we wanna fly free)
Doggies and dolls
I wanna be facing them all
Light up my fire

Blame it on the buzz
I am never gonna get enough

Someone to be wasting your time
Well I'm your partner-in-crime, boy
You should fly away with me

Was never really meant to do right
So come on, feed the meat to the tiger
We need to get in too deep

Oh-oh-oh
Where did they all run to?
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever

Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time

And dear, buddy don't you cry when she goes
'Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy don't you cry as they go
Life makes us critical and all, we gotta change the course

Well, when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song

I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Baby when we were young
There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat
That's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side (Ooh)

'Cause sometimes things just don't turn out as you wished for
And that's what late night city lights are there for
You asked me back then what I wanted to do
But I didn't really know, did you?

My mama said, "Someday, you are gonna shine"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
"You'll meet a guy who'll show you how love is kind"
(Don't know where I'm traveling to)
I'll run away and follow a strange old sign
(Dare no others to do)
Human I am, sorry I let you down
(I don't know where I'm traveling to)

What did you expect from these red lips?
Curses, laughter, and a tender kiss
Hours went by and you got it all
Empty walls in a hollow city hall
What was I to do but flee?
When all my thoughts lay far beyond the sea
(Let's go get lost)

"Teach you to ride on the wild horses of your own mind"

There's a light for you, burning for you
Oh, my mama said: "It is burning for you
Oh, don't let it go, oh, don't let it it go
You'll find a way, baby, make them all burn."
(You'll make them all burn)

I'm a post-teen monster, bold and blind
From the top of my head to the shaking ground
Blame the billboards cause they've let me down
I'm a symphony of the world gone wild
(What a pretty sight)
And I spit and I cry for the dirty mind
Never really got it, baby
(You'll make them all burn)

But I think about it all the time
Tough luck, when, oh, will the days come around
Boy I am thinking 'bout it all the time (ooohh)
(You'll make them all burn)

And I won’t, won’t stop ‘til the day I die

And we long for the place where we can be found
Burning like a star in our minds

Oh, what a world I was born into
Warriors are lying down
Hush, little head, you'll get sick
So sorrow-filled, I am
