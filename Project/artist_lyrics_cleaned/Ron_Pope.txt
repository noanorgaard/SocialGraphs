Oh, I used to treat you sweetly I would pull you to my chest as you cried about the ocean slipping quickly through your hands
You were searching for one grain of sand along an endless beach
As I was building you a castle that you just refused to see

What do I say? What do I do?
To show all the ways my heart is slowly shattering for you
What do I say? What do I do?

I don't wanna hold you if you wanna go
And I'm not gonna make you feel love if you don't
I would rather learn what it feels like to burn than feel nothing at all

You have faded my reality like leaves that turn to dust
Fell asleep inside a fantasy and woke up feeling lost
Now I'm terrified and restless but I just cannot escape
I wish you had words to cool this fever that is killing me

I don't wanna waste the weekend
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go
As my train rolls down the East Coast
I wonder how you'll keep warm
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on

And still, I can't let you be
Most nights, I hardly sleep
Don't take what you don't need from me

It's just a drop in the ocean, a change in the weather
I was prayin' that you and me might end up together
It's like wishin' for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most, 'cause you are my heaven

Misplaced trust and old friends
Never counting regrets
By the grace of God, I do not rest at all
New England as the leaves change
The last excuse that I'll claim
I was a boy who loved a woman like a little girl

And if it's time, oh Lord
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights

The Heavens shake with anger, and the
Clouds they curse the ground, and I'm
Screaming for an answer, but the
Darkness blinds me now, we will
Not survive with misery, we will
Fill ourselves with love we are
Searching we are hopeful, we are
Anything but lost

So if it's time, oh Lord
Shoot out the lights
