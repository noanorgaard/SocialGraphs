Can't wait for quittin' time, comin' around
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Listen for that bell, just wait for that sound
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
They'll see the smoke from our tires burnin' out

Hey! Hey!  What do you say?
Livin' is hard but I'm earning my way
Hey! Hey!  Oh-oh-oh!
What I know tomorrow, I'm learnin' today
You said you're leaving, you're going away
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way
Hey! Hey! Oh-oh-oh!
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way
I loved you babe but I can't stick around
I'm busting my ass but it's hitting the ground
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
I lost my place in this nothing town
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Gotta leave now cause it's beating me down
Gotta leave now cause it's beating me down

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
Livin' is hard but I'm earning my way
Hey! Hey! Oh-oh-oh!
What I know tomorrow, I'm learnin' today
You said you're leaving, you're going away
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way
Hey! Hey! Oh-oh-oh!
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way

We can just stay here
Raise a family
But that just ain't life
Or for you and me
Pack your things
Cut these strings
Oh-oh-oh!
Let's beat this town
We'll call it a day
Let's hit the road baby, what do you say?

Hey! Hey! What do you say?
Livin' is hard but I'm earning my way
Hey! Hey! Oh-oh-oh!
What I know tomorrow, I'm learnin' today
You said you're leaving, you're going away
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way
Hey! Hey! Oh-oh-oh!
But hey if you're going I'm comin' your way
Hey! Hey! Coming your way
Hey! Hey! Coming your way
Hey! Hey!
But hey if you're going I'm coming your
