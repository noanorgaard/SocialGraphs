Early in the morning, when the sun comes up
I'm punchin' that clock on the wall
Breakin' my back just to make you bucks
Wishin' I was in your arms

If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you

I could work all day and feel right at home
Lovin' that 8 to 5
And never have to leave you here alone
When I'm workin' overtime

If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you
I'd be a millionaire in a week or two
I'd be doin' what I love and lovin' what I do
If I could make a livin' out of lovin' you

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

Something 'bout the way she’s blushin' you can tell she isn’t sure
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

If I had a woman like that
Man I’d let her know
I’d hold her tight
I’d hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She’d never ever be alone
