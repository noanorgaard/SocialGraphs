Sherry, can you come out tonight? (Come, come, come out tonight)
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight?

(Why don't you come out? Come out)
To my twist party (Come out)
Where the bright moon shines (Come out)
We'll dance the night away
I'm gonna make you mine

Sherry baby (Sherry, Sherry baby, Sherry baby)
Sherry, can you come out tonight? (Come, come, come out tonight)
(Come, come, come out tonight)
You'd better ask your mama (Sherry baby)
Tell her everything is alright

(Why don't you come out? Come out)
Put your red dress on (Come out)
Mmm, you look so fine (Come out)
Move it nice and easy
Girl, you make me lose my mind

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)

(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do
