Riffraff!

Street rat!

Scoundrel!

Take that!

Just a little snack, guys
You might also like
Rip him open, take it back, guys

I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu

Who?
(sung)
Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime

I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em

Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time, gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block
Stop, thief!

Vandal!

Abu!

Scandal!

Let's not be too hasty

Still, I think he's rather tasty

Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise, we'd get along

Wrong!

One jump ahead of the hoofbeats (Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump (Street rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster (Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster (Riffraff!)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is
