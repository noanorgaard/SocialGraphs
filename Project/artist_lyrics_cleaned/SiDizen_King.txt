Some call it talkin and so me call it crushin
Some call it everything they wanted cuz there ain’t no cuffin
Be your man, hold your hand, when we not in public
But around the fam understand that we barely touchin
Some call it patience and some call it ducking
And it’s our favorite temptation, no hate to David Ruffin
We're the generation that’s done away with the all or nothing
But what he calling liberation, she be callin suffering
But even though you hate it, it’s better than nothing
Ironic how no strings attached make you feel like a puppet
Her train of thought be runnin deep, word to Harriet Tubman
She wants them walks up on the beach, but I’d rather be clubbin
She stay complainin' bout LA she say LA ain’t Brooklyn
I hate to rain on your parade, you shoulda stayed Brooklyn
Your ladies say ultimatum is the only way to hook him
I crossover, fadeaway, and hope you overlook it

You wanna rock the boat, I wanna ride the wave
(You won’t even budge a little, we stuck in the middle)
You wanna switch from stop to go, I wanna wait
(You won’t even budge a little, we stuck in the middle)

(You won’t even budge a little, we stuck in the middle)

All the homies seem to think she's gonna get to me
Look, my soul's cold, never fold like the fitted sheets
Praise god, you know I raise guard that I never take off like the sticker on your fitted be
But lowkey, my actions is contradictory
She got me feeling warm as paper out the printer be
'Cause when we vibe, we don’t even need to speak
'Cause it’s wild how her smile fills the silence like a speech
Preach
You might have noticed that I’m outta my element
But I’m tired of pretending my emotions are celibate
I don’t vibe with the notion we just friends with benefits
Forget the etiquette, l’m addressing the elephant
Been too long, I been holding the truth
That every time my phone buzz I’m hoping it’s you
Know I ain’t alone 'cause you hoping it, too
Turns out I was wrong, must've had it confused 'cause she said
You wanna rock the boat, I wanna ride the wave

Friday night fever, we should be dancing, we should be, we should be dancing
Vibe to the beat ‘cause Thai food’s on me
The whole world’s asleep, but we acting out our dreams
You catching feelings, maybe we should just slow down
Take it easy, we just might be right, just not right now
