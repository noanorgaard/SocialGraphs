When the bombs are bursting in the air
And the rockets are making that red glare
I'm headin' down, down to that good hope town
Where the weather's fair

So why don't you come away
With me, my love
We'll do what it takes, I'll keep you safe
Why don't you stay by me
And when the time comes, we'll escape

When the big one finally hits LA
When Yellowstone has its day
We're headin' to the southern tip on a plane or on a ship
We'll do what it takes, we'll find a way

And if that cloud forms up above
No sign anywhere of a dove
There'll be no reason left to stay, we'll try and live another day
In a place where there's still love

So why don't you come away
With me, my love
We'll do what it takes, I'll keep you safe
Why don't you stay by me
And when the time comes, we'll escape

Oh, come away with me, and we'll escape
Oh, come away with me, and we'll escape

So why don't you come away
With me, my love
We'll do what it takes, I'll keep you safe
Why don't you stay by me
And when the time comes, we'll escape, we'll 

There is a song, you're tremblin' to its tune
At the request of the moon
Lickin' her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

And maybe the planets are tryin' to become the stars
And we really came from Mars
The earth is alive and man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight
I need to lose myself tonight

Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how

I think with my heart and I move with my head
I open my mouth and it's something I've read
I've stood at this door before, I'm told
But a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought with something I felt
Confuse what I feel with something that's real
I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, he wouldn't even take a bite

Far away, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Don't delay, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Far away, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Don't delay, I heard him say (Come with me now)

Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how

Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear

I need to lose myself tonight
Whoa, come with me now
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
