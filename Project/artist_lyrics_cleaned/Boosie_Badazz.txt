Ten years spittin' this real shit down the pipe
Fuckin' right I done hustled white
I done laid niggas down, I done ran the block
From the bottom to the top
I'm a gorilla, ask the hood, I'm a good nigga
Got the right to say I am Baton Rouge nigga
I done made niggas money, you already know
Now It's time for Me to be a CEO, so, after this album, I got to go
But if you need me nigga, I got you though
I done strapped in jail, no checkout, nigga
I got the right to hold my chest out, nigga
I never told on nobody
Had pure cocaine like Yo Gotti
I done made niggas
I done saved niggas
When the boss shit came I did not run
Got the lawyer, made the bond, made real niggas out my lil' son
I done hit the interstate, plenty times
I-ten chain represent the grind, day for day, dime for dime

You already know
Show for show
State for state
I done made the cake
I done took my niggas across the world
Did so much for they boys and girls
I done gave away so much to kids
Swear to God, I love the kids
But I'm 'bout mine, I slang iron
I gotta rep the street, don't fuck with his
I done paid my dues, win or lose
I'm like B.B. King when you talk the blues
Went from wang-dang chains to bling bling (Bitch)
But I deserve it
Been true to the game, I taught people
When the hurricane came, I housed people
When the lights off, I done came through
A lot of niggas mad 'cause they ain't Boosie
I done road for my dogs, retaliation
"Fa, Fa, Fa", No hesitation
When I done jumped out the car with pistols
So Big Mel, wouldn't go to jail
Shit that wasn't supposed to be said on songs

Real talk, I've done it all
Twelve years old, stealin' out the mall
I done ball till I fall and got back up
I done fucked every bitch you tryna cut
I'm a damn good daddy, you already know, but I took my liquid child support
I done beat them bitches in court
So many times
I ain't lyin'
I done seen dead bodies, young as hell
Real talk, know some niggas on that real
My music hold 'em down, I done damn near been killed by the K9
Had to wrestle niggas tryna take mine
In the hospital 'bout to die, woke up and saw little blinking eyes
I done been bust on a couple times
I didn't get hit I'm a black cat, nine lives
Fuckin' right I'm a little long
I grind and got my own home
X, pills, and PCP, ain't none of that shit stopped a G
A big dog, chasin' cheese, settin' followed by the FEDS
I done paid my dues (Strugglin'), paid my dues (Hustlin')
I done paid my dues (Bust'in), so, I can't lose

Boosie Badazz
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Boosie Boo
King of Louisiana, I been the truth
If you don't know, better ask somebody
I am the show and the afterparty
I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no mo'
Still on my grind, got a lot of kids at home
Gotta get it on, late night to the early morn'
Fifty grand in my pants like Ivy Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown
Neck kind of freezy, boy believe me
You can playa hate, but take it easy
We done got the streets, me and Jeezy
Learned from the game how to stack the breezy
Got love from the hood so it's all good, we both gon' eat, me and Jeezy
Riding down the highway (Zoom, zoom), .45 on the side me (Boom, boom)
Bad chick on side me (Ooh, ooh), she rollercoaster ride me (Woo!)
In the projects where ya find me, I got the hood behind me
My records selling out the stores now
My money don't fold now
You best believe it, they feeling me
From Alaska to Tennessee
From the East to the West Coast
I smoke on the best smoke
We pushing Lambos, Phantoms and Bentley coupes now
People hollerin' out the windown "Hey Boosie, you got the juice now!"

Stacked brick on top of brick, yeah, I laid my foundation 'til I built my house
And it was mixtape after mixtapes and then the next thing you know, I was runnin' the South
Streets introduced me to the trap, see that wasn't enough, see I wanted the world
And that's about the time my album dropped and the next thing you know I was runnin' the world
Who ya think ya is bitch, one of the girls?
See ya ass in ya jeans makes me wonder girl
I'm a super nigga, need a cape for me, real street niggas they relate to me
A big disappointment I would hate to be
In the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong line with the wrong man
Right car with the wrong thang
Can't tell me shit, I'm a grown man
Sixteen years old with a old thang
Same clothes for days, same spot for months
Two AKs and a box of blunts
If it's money you want, it's money you get
Ya hang out with the boy then it's money you get
Ya ever believe that I'd ever believe
That I'd ever achieve what I ever achieved
Stop this bitch, let me tell the world something
From the bottom to the top, shoulda seen that shit
Me and my lil' thug got it from the mud
Every thang I spit I really mean that shit
It's crazy, ain't it? Hard to explain it
I done got famous, all I did was bring it
The Savage Life behind the mic
Now everybody hollerin' 'bout Trill Entertainment
Rest in peace, Pimp C
I scream that shit every time I do shows
You put me on, and I ain't forget
So for my nigga, I gotta fuck two hoes
Whatever y'all mean that I ain't got cream
If ya see me in the hood, don't think I can't leave
When I was nineteen, I really had whole mil'
These other lil' niggas just sellin' y'all dreams
I ain't through yet, I done done at all
But I got a lot of stuff that I ain't get to do yet
I fucked up, I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gonna make it through that
From Miami, to L.A., back to Manhattan where the big cake
From Baton Rouge, I done did it, go ahead, admit it, I'm the shit, hey
And I don't care what a bitch say
I'ma be like this 'til I get gray
And I ain't puttin' no rims on it
When it's $500 ya ride factory
The new album is on the way
When it's the real deal, ya know ya gotta wait
Bad Azz gon' act a dog ass
And y'all already know this
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (My money don't fold, I'm gettin' this dough)
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (Always stay true stick to the G code)
