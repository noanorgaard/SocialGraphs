Doing it independent
They told me I hit a wall
They wondering where I'm headed
Busy buying the bar and they busy trying to rent it
It happens when you sit around and wait cause you forget it
And I be playing poker with a blind man, throwing all my chips in
Working till I'm breaking every record like I'm Ripken

I take it back on some nostalgic shit, oh you whylin’ bitch
Been doing this since before I was a college kid, let’s go
Oh this shit remind me of, the summer time
The slip and slide, some bump and grind
Oh this shit remind me of the parking lot
And skipping class, and smoking pot
Oh this shit remind me of parties with the freshman
Second base on the couch, plus she gave me mouth to mouth
Oh this shit remind me of tryna make a fake I.D
Walked into the liquor store, but they ain’t selling shit to me
Oh this shit remind me of riding with my crew
Water bottle full of booze, breaking in in people’s pools
Oh this shit remind me of acting like a fool
We was seventeen and we thought it was cool
What you know about it?

And I know things ain’t always gonna go your way
Cause we got shitty jobs and we got bills to pay
But I think that the future’s looking fucking great
So get your hands up in the sky let’s celebrate

Remind me of, remind me of, remind me of
(If you like it let it go
That’s the shit I miss the most)
Oh that shit remind me of the good times
This shit remind me of the good times

Oh this shit remind me of being somber in the club
Hanging out with tons of girls and they just wanna do some drugs
Oh this shit remind me of fake handshakes and shoulder shrugs
Walking into every label, they pretend they gave a fuck
Said they love my music, think I’m special, and they wanna sign me
Then I leave, and they gon’ say, the same damn thing to the three behind me
Oh this shit remind me of why I never sold my soul
Two thousand kids in my city they just wanna see me blow
Then I went across the country, saw two hundred thousand more
Oh this shit remind me of everything I wanted bro
So I won’t ever be a rapper that you see complaining
If you want it, go and take it, step up, word to Channing Tatum
Damn I go so looney on these tunes, I should be animated
This is for my English teacher, way back when who always hated
Okay Mr. Davis, I won’t rub it in your face
But you should turn all of my grades from B+’s into some A’s
And I know things ain’t always gonna go your way
Cause we got shitty jobs and we got bills to pay
But I think that the future’s looking super bright
So let me see your hands up in the sky like one more time

Oh that shit remind me of

Bring it down like
And you been rocking with the
The happy camper
Oh 

Haha, why you always gotta be inconsistent?
Why you never talk a lot, but you always bitchin?
And when it comes to sex, you never change position
I'm bored as shit, let's do something different
You can play with balls, like you were from New England
But I don't really think of what you think about
And I don't even care what you do
But when you text me real late like
"Hey yo, what's up?"
I'm probably not talking to you
Cause all you wanna know is where the blow is
Who got tables, when you rolling, can I bring friends?
I don't think so
But how about one friend from San Francisco?
Okay, she can come
In a room full of Neo's, I be the one
Girl, let's get Rousey, I beat it up
You need a fake ID to be in the club?
Uh, I think you put a spell on me
Ending up with you, that could be an L to me
You spend a hundred dollars on some damn shampoo
But it still smell like L'oreal to me

I know it's not a promise, you got what you wanted
Champagne and pools

Okay, are we starting? Yea-ah
Reportin' live from planet basic
We talk a lot but we don't ever say shit
Sayin' something that we truly feel
But that's just not in the conversation
I'm semi-famous
Kinda ain't shit
Kinda sorta like almost made it
It's like I went from star in the making
To, “Oh, yeah him, yeah I hope he makes it"
When the hell did all that begin?
I wish I didn't have as many rapper friends
I wish I had way more actor friends
Least I couldn't tell they were acting then
I mean like damn can I get a tweet?
Hey hitboy, can I get a beat?
I guess if you don't sell CD's
Your BFF's start NBD's
At least my shit went number three
I mean Fetty Wap, Drake, and Future, too
Drake and fuckin' Future, dude!
What the hell was I supposed to do?
But I know I got something inside
You can't get from these other guys
Real ass songs and lyrics so true
That you can't get from these other minds
Right?
Champagne and pools, layin' by the palm trees
What else do you want from me?
Is it the house that I live or the things that I can give? Am I a fool?
Hey, for thinking I was different
Apart from all these Soho House guys that take you out
I wonder if you feel a thing, if you feel a thing
Besides the Xanax and highs
These tools that you hang out with
What else would you like me to give?
I know it's not a promise, you got just what you wanted
Champagne and
