As the darkness is crawling in
My emotions has been in over
Stained from the tears we shared
Shook'n up and then swept away
Nothing left just the memory stayed
Thick scars are holding me tight
Just wish I could sleep tonight
Took a pill just to help the pain
Swim for miles to get away
Just to sink underneath the waves
Catch my breath and begin to pray
Let the numbness begin to fade
Then I'll stand on my own again
Let the wind pick away the silence
Brave and sworn won't hold me from flying
Free to be loved, now
Free to be loved, now
Sun shines but the Lord has helped me
Subconsciously I prepare
Courage and faith will guide me
As the layers begin to shed
You might also likeLet my mind break away the burdens
As my new life begins to bloom
Consciously I surrender
Ready to face the truth
That has shown my dependency
Limitations will set me free
My desires and my beliefs
Patiently await for me
I can hear as they sing to me
Natures calling my destiny
Telling me no more suffering
Peace of hours will set you free
Free to be loved, now
Finally free to be loved, now
Free to be loved, now
Finally free to be loved,
