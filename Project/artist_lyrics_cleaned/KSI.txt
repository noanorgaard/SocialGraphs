Kilimanjaro at the top like a Pharaoh
Verified chicks want a follow for a follow
Asking for my P, what the fuck you trying to borrow
Aiming at your knee when I’m springing out my arrow
Come fuck with me
Come fuck with me
Fuck up your spree
No time to flee
Timber what I call when I push down a tree (timber)
I don’t care if Gudjon or Lee

Done with all the past, now I’m all about tomorrow
Little did you know, I’m the one they follow
All you other fools are hollow
Opposition here like "Oh, no"
Got me killing shit like Zorro
Workflow is beyond, no time here to be
Take time to respond when you texting me
Got no time for your shit, I'm tryna get lit
Climbing to the top is why I had to go and split
Destined for better
So watch me go get it
Trying to stop the man
Pfft, pathetic
I see what you’re scheming
But the man is so blessed that he’ll fuck up your demon

Breaking out like I'm in Pompeii
Playing the game and I'm here still winning
God bless to the guys team killing
Not on that side motherfucker devoted my team
Girls like my theme
Slurping my cream

Don't fuck with my angles

Drink in the hand got me feeling so fucked

We party and drink yeah we feeling supreme
Got no question when showing the fidies

‘Cause I’m sagging the Queen in my joggers (Cash)
Peacing out to the fuckers that doubted

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini (Yeah)
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini (Boom!)

B-B-Been in the game since Namco, ah-ah
Bring it back, I'm fully gassed, yo
Vroom, vroom, in my brand new Lambo
Juiced up, and I don't give a damn, yo
Going 120 (Yeah), and that's my slowest
On a one-way lane, like Lois (Argh)
Who's that? Superman's bitch
Wanna see what happens when I touch the Superman switch?
Ride with more peers than Morgan (What's up?)
Drive past vloggers that are walking
I taunt them, Matt Lees, can you see me? (Ha-Ha-Ha)
Wiling in my Lamborghini

Oh yeah
I be at home on the Xbox
Lord of the Mics in the background, slewing MCs with dreadlocks
Snap that party, told this girl "come round"
Chick's long-tempered but her head top (Whoa)
She goes hard till my head drops, oi
It's all eyes when we connect, oi
Doggystyle and a Playboy bunny from downstairs, upstairs
Sound like a pet shop (Mad)
Guys wanna hype on man
Call KSI, come yours and I'll put you in a headlock
I've been around since COD 4
Search and Destroy hardcore G3 with a red dot
Haters get treated like a ho
You can tell them suck my dick and get lost
Paparazzi wanna take pics when I'm out with my son
You can all get headshots
This flow's like Formula One
Cause I use the track like DRS
Quickly boosting the PRS
She's going ape when I beat her chest
Bro (Bro), it's mad (Mad)
You can tell Rihanna come see me
Might have to speed dial in that genie
JJ, lend me the Lamborghini

When I'm riding at speed, get that neck crack, ah-ah
Blazing on the engine, everybody looking back (Yeah)
Like I'm shooting, gra-ta-ta, got them going "fuck that"
Raise the fucking doors, I said make it look
Like a fucking eagle, like I'm starting wars
Dictating with my V12 deagle, speeds ain't even legal
Scaring people, we ain't equal
Danny Glover ain't got shit on my motherfucking lethal weapon
Armageddon sounding when the man arrives (Yeah-Yeah)
When we hype I come alive, like a 5 Alive
On the drive 21 years, smashing up the scene (Ah, Ha-Ha-Ha)
And I keep on winning, like I'm Mr Charlie Sheen
