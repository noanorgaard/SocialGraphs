Splurge on bitch spend a meal ticket
Imma spaz on a nigga bout a bank roll
I’m a eight figure nigga but I still kick it
Brought a bankhead and she don’t dial you when the bank call
Nigga Got a 20 p walking outta cricket
Pulling up the song with a couple hundred figures
Nigga betta pay respect or gonna pay the consequences
Give a damn who he is
Who you is a still get it

In the city you can die with it all in your hand
Aye, How could you even call him a man all he bringing to the table is his balls in his hand (broke nigga)
Aye and if yall all in demand then I aim  middle finger up to all of your fans
Cuz it take a real one to recognize a real one and if it ain’t a real one then recognize that I’m Done
Then I just say fuck it
Throw a few  birds in a brand new bucket
Ride through the hood make sure everything good and put my homeboys on til the feds come Running
Till the hater with the money on my head come gunning, sit they ass on fire like the gas I’m Burning
I make sure all my sons hear from all my cousins

Aimed for eight figures, shot past that, nigga
Set the world on fire, where your match at, nigga?
A.K.O.O. and Hustle Gang did thirty somethin' million
Another seven off of television, put that with it

Like a stand-up guy and a real nigga
Sucka ass nigga, don't deal with him

Nigga you play and get shot by the mornin'
Blat-blat-blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
Spray a whole hundred shots with no warnin'
Bales and them scales, before rap I was rich
Still hit them blocks, all up in the dead end
This a cold world, I've lost so many friends
So many fakes, I don't want no more friends
Stack all this money and count all the yams
Used to move weight and ain't talkin' 'bout no gym
Rubber band racks by the ten now
Used to be broke, went from bucket to Benz
I'm in a foreign car, she in another car
I pull up to the job, I walk in her job
And cum in her jaw like shotta
Se pasa en mi casa
Ain't lookin' over, I'm leanin' over
