That's something you should know about me

I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want-"
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want you"

And I can show you off
And if we're not too careful
Baby we can both get lost

I got this thing, gonna tie your tongue
Step in my ring, you'll be out round one
You want to feel, but you got no touch
You think it's love, but you think too much

I got it

You're crumbling, till you hit the ground
You wanna try, come and have your taste
This thing won't stop, till you can't see straight
