Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far, now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
Cause I'm an asshole, well fuck, I might be

Please fuck off, I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me

My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We all like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass won’t catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
I’d wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I’m here
And the night is mine

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait 'til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
I’m Seventeen

My mother said don’t forget where you come from, where you’ve been
Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
They keep you grounded
Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten
Oh but never were there truer words
In all my days I’ve ever heard
And when she told me little girl the answer is love
So those are words that I keep with me
Though the seasons change so quickly
Keep them buried in my heart
And never fought

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said take my time and breathe
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough
Guess I’ll be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

I was too young to understand what it means

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, "Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer," she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?

Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid

All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from "when boredom strikes" to "Ms. Star on the Rise"
It was all in an instant, man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them, man

Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
