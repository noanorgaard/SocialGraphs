Word to my f***** mom ya heard me
:
I’m a young Prince
Rogers Nelson ain’t bout no dumb sh**
The west side
Part of Philly ain’t make no punk b****
That's why
Anywhere I go I’ma run sh**
5’2
Little n**** that make her cum quick
Watch this, step outside I make the rain shine
Game time, Ludlow Sounds throw up my gang sign
Hair down
Sir and Kendrick we on the same vibe
Took it to Natina Janee' when my sh** got hang time
Uh
I’m a boss I call all them shots
That's ya mate, you ain’t safe
I know all them thots
5 h*** in the building like it’s Melrose spot
N***** ask a thousand questions I can tell yal cops
Whoah
You might also likeI'ma show yal n***** how we do it over here
On the West Side
West Side
What’s a m********** battle to a n**** that's war ready?
What the f*** is war to a n**** that's born ready?
Straight out his mom’s belly to wolves, bears, tigers and snakes
So don’t you ever make excuses when you got what it takes
B**** I got to be great
Nobody blocking my way that’ll get you socked in ya face
Keep my Glock in the case
Lay the Van Dam while my n***** Rob ya estate
Ain’t sh** sweet, I’m young OG
You got the right one today
I got a skinny pretty cocoa butter shawty out in Oakland
And another in Sonoma
And it’s funny cause they know each other
Uh
That's ya b**** at the concert buying posters of us
White girls throwing p**** like my team the f***** Jonas Brothers
That's right
Still that 45 on my left side, let’s ride
Pretty baby looking like Left Eye
Yes I
I met her rolling through the West Side
Met her rolling through the West Side
West Side
West SIde
West SIde
If you want us on the West Side
West Side
If you want it check the West Side
West
