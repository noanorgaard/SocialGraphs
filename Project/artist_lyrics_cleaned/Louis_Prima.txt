Tale of my city
Same shit different day
Same music don't pay
Automatic flight
Backflip delight
Drop back fall out
Knowmsayin peep the cloud
Keep watch don't lace
Purple strings black bass
Star wars far shores
Galactic battle s'mores
Rappers on all fours
Scribbling with greasy pores
Care less don't try to lore
Big base but you're a bore
Shady but I hate the gore
Janus knocking at ya door
On a tear but i tore
Radiation at the core
Ignorant to sublimity
Straight up speak bout infinity
My thoughts aren't miniscule
Self inflicted ridicule
Prevents optimal fuel
Fire welding the jewel
15 cents but I got blesses
Begging for my successes
Beanie conceals my tresses
Baggy sweats leave me restless
Riding on a wave
Don't forget to wave
Collect all and save
Produce til the grave
Feel like a slave
Bliss in this cave
Sober life so you can't see me
A Navajo shot down by a cree
So I'm rebounding the rock
You're sounding like a mock
Blood stains on my smock
SS reefer at the dock
Ditch the body sail away
Just writing another day
Lyrical hatin feel like a
Satirical satan I'm just
Regurgitating information
& cultivating contemplation
Sometimes it feels life is worthless
Sometimes I wish life would hurt less
It is what it is
Bubbly soda fizz
Random word wiz
Craft of king Wizard
Inspired my blizzard
Ice bending reptilian
Kechleon Charmeleon
Xombie J chameleon
Karma over a million
Call it Xombillion
You might also likeForget About J
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say but nothin comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of jiberish, and motherfuckers act like they forgot about XombieJ
Go away you're stressin me tf out okay?
I'm chillin at home just leave me alone
Leave it at the tone or delete the digits to my phone
Your a stale cone, mess with me your gonna get poned
I miss blazin to the dome, at least I got memory foam
I'm the grim reapers cousin, sting you like the beez are buzzin
Arch Angel in tangle, gang'll mangle
Under the influence grind meat like mince
Egyptian prince, you're just a nuisance
I'm feeling timid, I live in a pyramid
Octagonal prism, persistent optimism
Dont know the definition of pessimism
Wisdom helped me pursue an exorcism
I'd deal with bondage for your masochism
No tazers zombie eyes like lasers
No chasers no college hazers
The moons motion pushes oceans
Lone wolf howlin for bush lotions
That was weird
Bonfire seared
Sacrificed twice
Rollin dice thrice
Third time's the charm
Didn't mean to cause you harm
Gashed my leg, burned my arm
Corny chicks frog  like a farm
Believe it or not
These lyrics ain't cheap
I dont appeal to sheep
EDM clouds to peep
Electrify ya like mareep
Heres a haiku
Pikachu, Raichu
Electrify with thunder
Ignore the blunder
Japanese blender
Mix master render
Hip hop fender bender
Made for both genders
House? Return to sender
Cynicism for a trender
Lyricism for an acivist
I'm a coexistent pacisifist
Lip to Switch (bang bang)
Cocked back with bars
Shooting for stars
Reloaded purple pen
Fuck now gimme then
Here ye here ye
Thou shant see
What I depict
In a film script
Seroquel script
Lithium licked
Cranium ticked
Mania kicked
Abiility mischieved
Stability achieved
Institutionalization
Led to a vacation
Of self-exploration
Cultivating contemplation
About my final destination
Do I really wanna be on these meds?
I don't wanna be dealin with the feds
So ima smoke these reds
Catch me skiing with dreads
Risen from the dead
Ignore the bed head
XombieJ steezin the slopes
Grinding rails like tight ropes
Balanced like yin and yang
Lip to switch like 
Animalistic orangutang
Autistic shower head hang
Scissor resister cuz
I woulda missed her
Corruption Ft. NZA (produced by Rich McIntosh)
(NYZ's verse)

(XombieJ's Verse)
Freestyle flow but the writing nevers stops
Last night I had a dream about dodgin cops
10th prestige in ghosts, fuck black ops
Chain saw mows em down like LeBron flops
Walking sentry I'm the gentry of the century
Society's Way is elementary Balance is complementary
Who needs a purple pen when I'm livin in then
Defeated my demons now I'm the one schemin
Fuck Lucifer
Gimme a reason to commit treason
I'll cease him any season to appease him
Got a song? I wanna hear it
Im about Body mind and spirit
Don't fear it I’ll steer it
This lyric, You're not near it
Just, meditate
Allow your troubles to evaporate
Watch your worries condensate
Feel happiness precipitate
Another trip to the psych ward
Back spasms trucked me like a Ford
Frightful experiences I can't afford
Livin good i got a crew I need a horde
Acoustic bass cuz I lost my cord
Altruistic case because I got bored
We are
Metaphysical star containers
You're a
Hypocritical fart retainer
Im a
Dominant Omnist optimist
With confidence
In my competence
Psychic In a state of psychosis
Diagnosis to foresee a prognosis
Predict a pterodactyl attack
Beware of a sinnosaurus flak
Rear naked choke hold
Jiu jitsu joke's old
Don't try to be bold
Carrier clinic cold
They worry about economics
Put Me on 10 antipsychotics
That shit is exotic
Doctors hypnotic
This isn't melodic
Wish I was aquatic
Underwater wings
I like how it rings
Fins soar like I'm flying
Pancakes are frying
I'm not even trying
Ignore that I'm dying
Lucy Pulling me in
I just can't win
You make me wanna sin
Glad I got rid of the gin
Alcoholics anonymous
Anomaly not ominous
Sobriety synonymous
I found Balance for stability
Gotta get outta this facility
Coexist in the mainstream
Blacklist but I daydream
Wish I was prominent
Ramapo dominant
Doesn't really count
On a hill,not a mount
Skiin down the slopes
Medicinal isotopes
Prevent optimal scopes
But I have high hopes
Who Am I?

Who am I ?
A rhyming guy
Built to fly
Can't get high
Don't wanna die
NZA asks why
Ignore my sigh
-
Don't cry bro
Take it slow, yo
Time heals any feels
Buy meals not deals
No pep conceals
Training wheels
Slipping on peals
Climb to the peak
Even if you're weak
Take it week by week
Don't look at my beak
Maybe I'm a freak
Focus on my streak
Purple stripe geek
Catch me at Creek
Safety with a tweak
Skier chick I seek
Information leak
Cider mill like meek
Burned by the six
Learning new tricks
Ignoring all the pricks
Posted up like bricks
Got a new pair o' kicks
Got my instrumental fix
I'm out
And I'm back
A zombie soldier
Forget what I told ya
Apocalyptic Attack
Zombie J on the track
Ableton 9 on the Mac
In the city like rack
2016
Throw my first flat 3
Do it off a dare
Grab Japan in the air
Dub flat 9 right on time
Boomerang lui kang
I like geckos and dogs
I hate sheep and bogs
Undead in a fog
Reread in a log
Rap faker
Heartbreaker
Not a money maker
Baller like laker
Hardcore Parkour
Sick Trick addict
Just Another nonsensical rhyming guy
So stop and ask yourself, Who am I?
6acrifice
Cinderella man with a fan
Tan cakes with some pan
Banned game with a cam
Filming rain like got damn
Peaceful presences care
Easeful present is a dare
Bluetooth couldn't pair
We're an Apple and a pear
I'm baffled he's a bear
Raffle ticket s are rare
Spiked by Mario's f-air
Yikes! That wasn't fair
Mic'd Gambino's hair
Like wario's ware
Wear maroon n stare
Take 5 im on a tear
Mix tricks sweet Twix
Six g-d makes me sick
Call me six Satan trick
Beelzebub burned by bic
Backyard bonfire lit wick
Mac tards can't spit quick
Furious fire flame flickin
Bars bite teriyaki chicken
Rewind pickles pickin
Cukes hazardous dukes
Nuke Darth like Luke
I'm not crazy ya kook
Look I'm just manic
Maybe a little satanic
If you got a problem, Tragic
Writing's a simile for magic
Ima ball harder than Dragic
Fall with style like Logic
Hang tate with a hatchet
I'll roll an L if you match it
Bake brownies, I'll batch it
Evil eye, I'll never patch it
Socket smokin a ratchet
G top roulette Suzette
Wet like my palm sweat
Gently pets guitar frets
Tectonic
Young Yaakov
Cult in a cove
Bohemian grove
Flames that I hove
Fire bender want a
Katara with a katana
Chillin in a sauna
Sweatin out the trauma
Yawn cuz ima pawn ya
Undead knight
Freak and fright
Lookin for light
Lay it out tight
Flat 3 Japan
Cakes in the pan
Left right Left
Chiseled cleft
Mallot theft
Bruised heft
Can't guess my gesture
Thoughts sting and fester
Don't care if I rap faster
Syllabillical caster
Ghost speller call me Casper
Hold English like a grasper
I'm a writer not a rapper
I'll guide the path like a mapper
Louis and Clark expedition
Beyond artistic ambition
Tectonic plate fission
Pangaea is the mission
Reverse continental drift
Spectate consequential shift
Perhaps violence would cease
Mayhaps we achieve peace
Xombillions of years from now
Grinding gears
Balanced ears like Tao
Pewter prospective
Platinum incentive
Inward perspective
Self reflective monk
Not a Vandal punk
I don't smoke skunk
With a bottom bunk
I'ma make it to the top
Gave my cloud to a cop
Writing never stops
Zombie head mops
Decapitating crops
Backyard black ops
Pulling weeds not smoking
Prior needs not joking
Bipolar disorder
Origin is Mordor
Satan or Sauron?
What meds are You on?
No more beer
No more fear
Little bit of lithium
Little bit of helium
Blazing on the tracks
No Marlboro packs
Just Longboard wax
Shoutout to Dax
Past present future
No need for a suture
You'll be easy cashin if you
Stick to your passion
Levitation
(xombie)
Zombie slayer
Black ops player
Super saiyan sayer
I should run for mayor
I Pack a punch
You pack a lunch
Lying in your waves
Have fun at your raves
Running from your own thoughts
You forgot what you were taught
Try to focus on your self
You don't need any help
Heres something to contemplate
Can you rappers meditate?
Your thoughts evaporate
I learned to levitate
If we're an atom I'm the valence
You're a neutron I found Balance
So what makes us the same?
String theory must be tamed
Imagine infinite intertwining
Twelve dimensions alligning
Come together quit whining
Coexist I'll meet you dining
Doesn't matter what you do
We all matter and mass too
Entropically engineering eyes
Universal order in disguise
Made up by dimensions we just
Make up a dimension
I don't have dementia
It's galactic dyslexia
Don't disregard my perception
I don't strive for deception
Dimension inception
A zombie infection
It's really all the same
Life is more than a game
Humans are impotent
Comprehend infinite
Chambers unlocked
By Janus and Spock
Time and space
Lines and lace
Ignore my pace
It's not a race
You sing with grace
I speak with bass
Zombies aren't rhythmic
My third eye is cystic
Everything Happens For A Reason
This one is for all my fallen soldiers
Its okay little pup
Keep your chin up
Shoulders broad
You're not a fraud
Frontflip hucking
Gymnast tucking
Lover
Hover above her
Take cover
In a better place now
Don't wanna face how
Contemplating why
Sorry if I cry
She was the Apple of my eye
So whyd she have to die?
Questions are unansw-ered
Unfortunately reo-ccurred
The other times are just a blur
Primer for the coat of fur
Insulated for protection
Ignorant objection
In a state of denial
Livin life on trial
Judge lost the file
Lost in a weed pile
Damn we used to burn
For you I still yearn
I have so much to learn
My publicity is the least concern
I see your signs in the clouds
Bright skies smoking louds
I know you found peace
Flying higher than geese
You weren't so shy
Had an older guy
You were caught in a tie
It was knotted I won't lie
Don't think of it as social treason
I see you in the changing season
You warm me when it's freezin
Everything happens for a reason
Peace, yo
Yo
I’m just chillin
Like a villain
Hyroglyphic encryption
Not much prescription
In the kitchen
Im not bitchin
Cymbals itchin
Hi hats pitchin
Drums in my veins, in my blood
I’m feeling shot like elmer fudd
I hope this ain't a dud
Level swing like dudley
Lithium is the key
Seroquel numbs me
Bipolar manic, im a maniac
The nerdiest of all, a brainiac
The code you can’t crack
Feel like kurt cobain
Matching shirt stain
Melon saved me from the rain
It was pouring felt like pain
Reminds me that he’s slain
Beelzebub hit by a train
Pikachu will always main
Buddy might be my bain
Do you believe I’m sane?
Just a real life super saiyan
Wish you knew what i was saying
Wish you knew that i was slaying
Wish i spent more time praying
Wish my listeners were paying
Wish my image was portraying
Glad my teeth are not decaying
Wish you heard me spraying
This shit ain't dire
It ain't lyrical fire
But i hope you admired
Cuz I’m fucking tired
Peace,
