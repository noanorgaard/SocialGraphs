I’ll promise him forever from the day we say, "I do"

I've got my white boots
My white dress
And baby, I ain't getting them dusty
All I need you to bring
Are the rings
And I know in time I'll be ready
Cause I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting on
You
In my white boots

Going on three years with the love of my life
Everything about him made the waiting worth while
It wasn't always easy but I listened for the truth
So don't give up true love is gonna find you

Waiting, waiting, waiting on
You
