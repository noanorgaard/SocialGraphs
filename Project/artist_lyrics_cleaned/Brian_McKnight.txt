It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you went away, yeah
I miss you so much
And I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better
But it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you went away

And do you ever ask about me
Do your friends still tell you what to do
Everytime the phone rings
Do you wish it was me callin' you
Do you still feel the same
Or has time put out the flame
I miss you, is everything okay?

It's hard enough just passing the time
When I can't seem to get you off my mind
And where is the good in goodbye
Tell me why, tell me why

I miss you so much

Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say

Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
Don't want no more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me, come back to me, oh

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one
Yeah, yeah

It's so incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
'Cause

Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time
