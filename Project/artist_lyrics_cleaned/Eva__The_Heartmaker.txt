Twenty-four something, still going strong
Nothing is missing, yet something is wrong
I can not describe it, this feeling I have
"Keep on smiling", My mum used to say
But I can not keep on living this way
So how can we fix this, this feeling I have?

And I do
Yeah I do, listen

I'm on the inside of an empty shell
How did I get in here?
Well, I don't know for certain, but somehow I do
And I'm keeping my head up, refuse to go down
While you're there waiting for me on the ground
Saying "How can we fix this?", Hell, I don't know

But I do
Somehow I do

You're all that I know
And it's scaring me so
If we go back in time
Would you choose to be mine?
Something you said
That it's all in my hеad
This feeling that scares me so
Is the fеar of having to let you go
You might also like
Twenty-four something, still going strong
Nothing is missing, yet something is
