We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
Ooooh oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh

Sheila put the knife down
There's a lot I never said
Sheila put the knife down
Or go ahead and kill me dead
You're an only child and it really shows
And I'm a heartless prick, God only knows
Every young girl's dream to find
Her boyfriend lying on her floor
What'd I tell you?
You might also like
We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
Ooooh oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh
Ooooh oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh

So quiet, you walk into the room, well
I should've known this was gonna happen soon
Don't laugh, get it over quick

Sheila you don't love me
You just want someone around
So Sheila put the knife down
I was joking when I said

We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
We're all fucked up some or other way
Some of us collect, but most of us pay
We're all fucked up some or other way
Watch it come down, I'll see you someday
Sheila put the knife down
Ooooh oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh
Sheila put the knife down
Ooooh oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
