I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside 'em
Like a blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I'll wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
You might also like
I don't need to be a superman, ah ah
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

Now the lights are goin' out
Along the boulevard
The memories come rushin' back
And it makes it pretty hard
I got nowhere left to go
No one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never givin' up on you

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way
(Heaven)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
(Heaven)
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh oh
(Heaven)
It's not too far away
Oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
