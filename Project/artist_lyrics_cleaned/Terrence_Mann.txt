Love that launched a thousand ships

Please! Let's talk about anything else but love

Love that causes war and famine

Can't we speak about real estate?

Love of wife

Watergate?

Love of children!

Seasonal fluctuations in the prime interest rate?

Love of chocolate, you must love chocolate, everybody loves chocolate, say you do, say it

Can't we talk about anything else but

Love is elation
Like an oration
Love speaks to us in tongues
Natural as teething
Simple as breathing
Air in the love-starved lungs
Love looks at us and sighs

That's all a pack of lies
Love is a fiction like an affliction
Love is an ancient curse
Posing contentment
Causing resentment
Fulfilment in reverse
Love is a dismal thing

Mal! Why should we fight, let's sing!
(spoken)
And you know the only thing better than singing?
What?

Singing and dancing!
(sung)
Let's not talk about anything else but love
Worth repeating
Let's not talk about anything else but love

Why?

Life is fleeting and pleasures come
Pleasures go
Love can come and go in one throw
Let's not talk about anything else but love
But love
But love

Did I just hear the word love?

Ahah!
Let's not talk about anything else but love

Of all the scams I'd ever heard
Love's the one that's most absurd

Let's not talk about anything else but love

And look what good is done
Not for me
Not my son

Be patient
And soon the way will be clear

Focus your fear

And troubles all will disappear

Let's not talk about anything else but love

It's hard for me to show you see, my mother didn't know you see

Let's not talk about anything else but love (Nothing better)

Afraid of a touch, I don't like it so much

Hold on tight
Say goodnight
But don't dream of starting a fight
Let's not talk about anything else but love
Since the dawn of man began
Everyone has had a plan
From Anchorage to Afghanistan

Immortalized by Paul Cezanne

Just like an orangutan
You've a short attention span
So we'll do the best we can
By golly and bipartisan
Let's not talk about anything old
Please don't leave us out in the cold
Let's not talk about anything else but love

But love
But
