Say you can fight
To save a life
To prove your right
I've fallen prey to a fury of ignorant minds
Wrong kind, my kind
Arrogance pure in all consuming fight for life
Can't you see you are the enemy
I see
You be
Numerical superiority
I be
You flee
Numerical superiority
You said you where unbeatable
That you were not like me
I dedicate my life to defeating you
I take your life and liberty
Witchhunt of zombies, downtrodden mortals take a stand
This time my time
No more to die as primeval justice plays it's hand
Can't you see, destroy the enemy
You might also likeI see
You be
Numerical superiority
I be
You flee
Numerical superiority
Taken all my life in a day
My life crumbled away
For this pain that i feel you must pay
My life captured in vain
Destroy all my life that's your way
My hopes shrouded in pain
For this pain that i feel your must pay
I leave you a revenant pain
When all other forms of conciliation have broken down then it's time to fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
I see
You be
Numerical superiority
I be
You flee
Numerical
