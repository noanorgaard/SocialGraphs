So we'll talk of the things you do
And so you'll do all the things I know you can
So we'll be lonely for a while

Kiss my cheek, and take me down on the side street
Cause all of these clowns still laugh just the same
And what we have, no one ever gives up lightly
What time is it when the whole world stops

And so we'll break our wrists, trying to
Hold up the world for a few more seconds, just
So we won't be lonely for a while

Well I guess it's just that time again
When you say that love is not, what you want
Well I guess it's just that time again
When I said that you could not
Be what I'm thinking of
Well I guess it's just that time again
When you say that there is nothing left
Well I guess it's just that time again
Oh, give me a second while
I catch my breath
While I catch my breath
Okay

Love again, this is not a celebration
Give me the prize, you know I never do that well
Take me out, take me to the ladies' party
Cause you know I, will have a good time there

And so you'll say that you don't mind, yeah
To stick around for a few more seconds, just
So you won't be lonely for a

So it won't be all night
It's light, can you take me away now?
I can see the old house
What's that? Lovers' creeping up the backstairs
Into the cloakroom
Outside's where I couldn't get your name right
Did we take a wrong turn?
Broken down in the dark of the country

Love, I seem to forget
But it won't take long to remind me
Of just what I don't do
Well that's true, that's true, that's true, that's true
Enough at one stage
Where we all do the same like we're told to
Be the same as
Cut back on the things you think you should have

Well, it's wrong that nothing's wrong
You don't really seem yourself
The best and the worst of all
You gave them everything that's left
Take in another breath (Get closer, get closer)
Gaze at the breaking shore (Get closer, get closer)
As they say (Get closer)
They're coming back when you're gone
You might also like
So it won't be all night
It's light, can you take me away now?
I can see the old house
What's that? Lovers' creeping up the backstairs
Into the cloakroom
Outside's where I couldn't get your name right
Did we take a wrong turn?
Broken down in the dark of the country

Well, it's wrong that nothing's wrong
You don't really seem yourself
The best and the worst of all
You gave them everything that's left
Take in another breath (Get closer, get closer)
Gaze at the breaking shore (Get closer, get closer)
As they say they're coming back (Get closer, get closer)
To knock down the concrete wall (Get closer, get closer)
To knock down the concrete wall (Get closer, get closer)
To knock down the concrete wall (Get closer)

Well, we spent a long time
Getting here through the fear
It was too dark to see
If you he wasn't on his knee
I'm sorry that it's not
Quite how you thought it would be
It's always the fucking same, just the same
You and me, come 'round, well I'd really like to see
We could watch the television, you could cook a pizza
Love, you're loud, you shout, you're proud
Well, sit down in the corner
Disappear into the background
Get closer (
