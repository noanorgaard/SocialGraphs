You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Then blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing, so let it go

If you could see yourself now, baby
The tables have turned
The whole world hinges on your swings
Your secret life of indiscreet discretions
I'd turn the screw and leave the screen
Don't point your finger
You know that's not my thing

You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Then blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing, so let it go now
You might also like
You've got a little worry
I know it all too well
I've got your number
But so does every kiss and tell
Who dares to cross your threshold
Or happens on you way
Stop laying blame
You know that's not my thing

You know that's not my thing
You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Then blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing, so let it go
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Then blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
It's not my thing, so let it go

You kiss on me, tug on me
Rub on me, jump on me
You bang on me, beat on me
Hit on me, let go on me
You let go on 

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine

Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive cinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh, this means
No fear, cavalier renegade steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

And I feel fine
The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck
Right? Right

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

You'll wind up in some factory that's full-time filth and nowhere left to go
Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself
I know it might sound strange, but I believe you'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year

At night, I drink myself to sleep and pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle all my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year

It's not as though I really need you
If you were here, I'd only bleed you
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and that's not how it ought to be
Well, I know it might sound strange, but I believe you'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another 

Oh, life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around?
Now, I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, 

Said leave me to lay, but touch me deep
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

Are you looking to drive my dreams?
You here to run my screens?
You come, deliver my demons
Hooray, hooray, hip-hip, hooray
Are you coming to ease my headache?
Do you give good head?
Am I good in bed?

I don't know, I guess so
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

I'm looking for an interruption
Can you believe?
Some medicine for my headache
Hooray, hooray, hip-hip, hooray
I'm pitching for a new direction
Pinch me when I wake
Don't tell me my dreams are fake

You leave me to lay, but touch me deep
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need
Leave me to lay, but touch me deep
I don't sleep, I dream
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really
