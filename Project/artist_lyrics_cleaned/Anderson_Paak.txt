I'm on my fifth brew and my rent's due
Sixth and west roof, I can see it all
Hold on to my hand, that's my lil' dude
Look at Kenzo, swaggin' like his paw
One for the occasion and get ya good suit
Fuck your reservation, bitch, I brought 'em all
Look at where you came from, Californication
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards and raiding your
Cookie jar, my radio analog, I wanted them
Nikes, mama got me Lugz (And all)

This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

One for the occasion, fuck your reservation
Call up all the haters, it's official
Californication, ever since a baby
Radio and the cable, I got the dish, too, and, oh

This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on

Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming

I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

This is the music that you gotta feel
Gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat, it ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch, who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?
Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel
Yeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat, it ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch, who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

Used to be scared of all my fears
'Til I woke up from this nightmare
Now what become of a dream deferred, now until I leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak, they say I'm preaching like I lead a church
No proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse
My job as an artist is making miracles
To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistable
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares, your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on

Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming

Oh my gosh, guys, calm down
Stop it

Now, evolution, where's it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history
And I doubt if, uh, very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
But there are other areas which are magnificent or treasures of this world
And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
They can find this way of 

There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong drinks
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
(Ooh, my love)
And the song we sang
(My love)

1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–

Come on, you feel me (The parking lot)

Bring the corners from left to right
How many more will it take to get a crossfade?
Coming closer to midnight and I'm wide awake
And ain't you afraid? Was afraid
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
But you made me wait
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
Please believe me, I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
And the song we sang

Can you dig it? Can you dig 

Okay, the blunt is rolled up, nobody lit it
Said, even if we don't puff, won't make a difference
My body's leaning to the right, baby
You tell me go on and spend the night, baby
No, I don't even know ya, I know enough to get you high, baby

I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said, "Go on and kick your feet up
I'ma go ahead and twist the weed up"
She said, "Cool to say what I think?"
I said, "Go and do what you feel"
She said, "Bend me over that sink"
I said, "Damn, your wish is my will"

I get the feelin' that you might be—
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong, but I'm feelin' that you might be—
And we ain't even smoke, but you swear I got that dope and I'm thinkin' you'd like to be—
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat and I'm knowin' that you like me—
Oh, you high, baby, high, baby
You might also like
Okay, I'm feelin' so stuck
Laid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth, girl, bring it closer
Before my high comes down, my high comes down
Girl, I can barely keep my eyes open
You say you tryna get your spine blown in
No, I don't even know ya, I know enough to get you high, floatin'

I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said, "Go on and kick your feet up
I'ma go ahead and twist the weed up"
She said, "Cool to say what I think?"
I said, "Go and do what you feel"
She said, "Bend me over that sink"
I said, "Damn, your wish is my will"

Ooh (Feelin' that you might be—)
Oh, tell me, are you high, baby? (Tell me, are you high, baby?)
Ooh (I get the feelin' that you—)
Oh, tell me, are you high as me? (Tell me are you high as me? Oh)
Ooh (I get the feelin' that you—)
Oh, tell me, are you high? (Tell me, you high? Are you high as me?)
Ooh (I get the feelin' that you—)
Oh, tell me, are you high? (Tell me you are, tell me, are you high as me?)

Baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well, if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

'Cause baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well, if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?

'Cause baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?
She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl, then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'ma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak
Baby, there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we
