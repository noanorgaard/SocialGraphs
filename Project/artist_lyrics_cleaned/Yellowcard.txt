I just want to say
I know I let you down, but I'm ready now
And I found a way that I can tell the truth, make it up to you

I know that I have always walked the line
In between my confidence and lies
So many scenes are full of words I wish I could rewind
But here you are, forgiving me again
You'll never know how real to me you've been
This is a start, another empty page where I begin

I just want to say
I know I let you down, but I'm ready now
And I found a way that I can tell the truth, make it up to you

I left home, but there's one thing that I still know
It's always summer in my heart and in my soul

I loved you first, I love you still
I always will
I loved you first (I loved you first)
I love you still (Love you still)

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream, and it gets me by
I can make-believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were begging me, not tonight

If I could find you now, things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow, we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me
