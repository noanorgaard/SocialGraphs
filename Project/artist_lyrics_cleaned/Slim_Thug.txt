Get out the game
If you can’t take your charge
This game ain’t for the weak
Ya’ll fucking up the odds
E’erybody tell it
But e’erybody sellin
Go get a job pussy
If you scared to be a felon
That’s a chance you take
For this money you make
Was in the free world stuntin
Big crib on the lake
Ya’ll get money made you real
You niggas real fake
Wish ma partners would have listened
When we told em you was fake
Free Jimbo, Lee Gray, Owl
And the 
Q H-Town hustlers
Tryna get that bread
All my hustlers in the game
I know they got you scared
These niggas working with the people
This game so evil
Ma niggas ain’t killed nobody
They just tryna feed they fam
They tryna give them life
For just moving them grams
Movin them birds
Wanting a better life
All I can do is pray
Have mercy Jesus Christ

Got plenty cheese, plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitatin' us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us

TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-Town (Yeah!) Home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

Yeh this the city that's slow, the city that's throwed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stay blowed
And hustlin' ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and the Belt

Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that North
I'm talkin' Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin' on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall, what it do baby

(Ha ha ha, know what I'm tawkin' 'bout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Blowin' down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunnyside
I could walk these streets if I was blind, know what I'm tawkin' 'bout?
Yung Redd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate, swear to God I was a jeweler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute

God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunnyside and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rollin' up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hidin'
Don Ke', heart of the south, slab ridin'

H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the Dirty South, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touchin' it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

State to state dawg, I got 'em jockin' the kid
6' backin' out the driveway, dropping the wig
Y'all know we do it big, like a freight-liner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put ya H's up, represent ya city bro

Now welcome to the place I love, place I was, raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Ridin' around, Southwest side of my town
Still reppin' my block, how ya likin' me now
It's from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

Chyeah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin' 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (Lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin' it like a Platinum Rolls
Suicide make the doors presidential when they decide to close (Real talk)
They want the throne but tell them haters that I got it locked (Got it locked)
I shoot 'em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (Doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way ya speak about the H, without mentioning me

West Bellfort, Fondren, Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood

And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil' O Homie

Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin' my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince, Silvia, Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I don't want it all I just need a slice

And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys 

I got super size swag, I'm honest with the class
Fresh up out the bag, somebody pull out my tag
I guess that's why these haters always looking so mad
I guess that's why this girl wanna picture so bad
Her heart beatin fast, while we froze for the pose
Before rap, I was most chose by the hoes
Before you go she slid me something else on the low
It read dial this to see me with no clothes


Beautiful by the bar, you wanna be a star?
Live like a boss in the big house and fancy car
How bout we make everything that's mine ours
For example let me let'cha hold a black card
And don't worry bout'cha man, he just act hard
Before he get to you, he gotta go through that squad
Ya like swimming, I gotta lake in my backyard
I'll take you on a date to the B.E.T. Awards

1 ContributorFlipping On 4's LyricsProd. By Mr. Lee

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cash flow

Money, hoes and clothes, is all a nigga know
And I been saying that shit since back in '04
Born in the hood but refuse to stay broke
Had to get rich, got tired of selling dope
Grind into the top now my momma living good
Living them dreams we was having in the hood
Boys better quit tripping and get up on their paper
Stop saving these hoes and avoid all these haters
Can't kick they ass nowadays they'll sue
When under pressure Your best friends telling on you
Where them bitches at, I keep plenty dimes
Money, hoes and clothes is all in my mind

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cash flow
You might also like
I speak the truth, never tell you lies
Still a hunnid ain't switch like them other guys
New year new levels of this boss life
Hopping out the drive rows like, suprise
And now them haters can't believe they eyes
Swear I wasn't gonna be shit, bitch apologize
Wanna see me lose, but a nigga still winning
Wanna see me stop but them 4's still spinnin'
Went from cheering for a nigga to being a hater
The gift in the curse of getting this paper
See ya later broke niggas I got new neighbors
Plus its cause I'm still getting new paper

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cash flow

Now look who creeping, look who crawling
Look who still balling in the mix
Still sticking long dick in your bitch
Your section full of niggas, my section full of hoes
At the club tryna fight, what you mad for
Everybody who I know mad mad cause they broke
I came to sell a grade, I made mills and making mo'
Meek free, DJ gonna play that intro
And everything he named on it but that lambo
Cause I couldn't fix same shit with yo bitch
You ain't gotta spit game to em when you getting rich
If I ain't broke boy then gonna fix ya

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cash

When you ride 4's patna stay strapped
The gone catch ya at the light and put one in ya cap

Ya win when you don't let this material shit impress ya
Insides like a dresser, woodgrain on the dash
