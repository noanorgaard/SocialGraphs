'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

Uh-huh
I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh
I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh (Uh-huh), uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'
We're in deep now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

Goin' in for the kill

It's rare when the panic in my mind
Feels so damn good
Woo

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in
