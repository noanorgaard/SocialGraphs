I have six kids and I don't like it
They eat too much and treat me like shit
They only wear Posh label clothes
If you give one hand, they bite off both
And all my friends, they have big cars
Big mansions, too, and smoke the fine cigars
They have deep pockets, I don't know why
I look in my purse and start to cry
Why?

I hate my life, and I hate you
I hate my wife, and her boyfriend, too
I hate to hate, and I hate that
I hate my life so very bad
I hate my kids, never thought
That I'd praise abort
Praise abort
Praise abort

I like to fuck, but no French letter
'Cause without kids, life is so much better
So in the end, I got forced
To stay away from female intercourse

I hate my life, and I hate you
I hate my wife, and her boyfriend, too
I hate to hate, and I hate that
I hate my life so very bad
I hate my kids, never thought
That I'd praise abort
Praise abort
Praise abort

Say goodbye, say goodbye
We rise up, up to the sky
Say goodbye, we'll come back
Soon as pretty butterflies
Make you cry

I hate my life, and I hate you
I hate my wife, and my boyfriend, too
I hate to hate, and I hate that
I hate myself so very bad
I hate my offspring, never thought
That I'd praise abort
I praise abort
I praise 

Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn
Fish on
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come, release my spawn
Fish on

It smells like fish, I take a sniff
The bait is fresh, my rod is stiff
The hook is big, made from steel
I put some grease upon my reel

Some are bigger, some are small
I don't care, I catch them all

I got my rod, I have my spear
I've ready set my fishing gear
Moby's dick is out of sight
They find my Nemo every night (Night, night, night, night)

Some are bigger, some are small
I don't care, I catch them all

Let your mermaids all be free
I get it out, release my spawn

Wild river
You stole my eyes
Never gave them back
You tried to kiss me
Set a shiver on my neck
Wild river
Wet golden shrine
You stole my mind
And tried to kill me
Sent a shiver down my spine

You hate the sun
But rain is nice
You love the snow
But you are afraid of ice
You're dressed in mud
Unsafe to dive
I want your gold
But you, you want my life
You want my life

You tried to drown me
Never mind to swim
And tried to eat me
Put a shiver on my skin
You tried to hold me
With million fins
And tried to heal me
Wash off my sins

Your kingdom come
We kneeling on the planks
All the trees bend over on the banks
Gives me a shiver
Wild river
You stole my eyes
Never gave them back

Set a shiver on my neck

Wet golden shrine

Sent a shiver down my spine

Bite off my sins

Let it rain, don't be blunt
Let it rain, what a stunt
Let it rain, make me grunt
Let it rain from your pretty cunt

(Golden shower) Don't be shy
Cunt
(Golden shower) Let it fly from your pretty cunt
(Golden shower) Golden sweat
Cunt
(Golden shower) Make it wet, let it jet

Please stand up, pink hairy sky
I creep down and wait
Wait for you to cry
Let me sip again
Give me more champagne
Be my human Eiffel tower
Give me, give me golden shower
