I crawled into the spotlight
Cleared my throat and I closed my eyes
I sang a song that I didn’t like
I sang a song that I didn’t like
And I was left in the long night
I hoped to God that I wouldn’t die
Before I gave it an honest try
Now I try
And I try
And try
To recall a little white light
Put me back into my right mind
I dig a hole and see what I can find
I dig a hole and see what I can find
I’ve been burying my whole life
Beneath the lie that it looks like
Beneath the song that I didn’t write
Beneath the song that I didn’t write
You might also like
I crawled into the spotlight
And in my state I was a sorry sight
I sing a song ’til I get it right
I sing a song ’til I get it
