So I want a little bit more, it felt better before
I wanna feel you in the cold shore
You get a piece of my colder heart
For you, it's like a ticket or a golden card

And when you, go go go go away, I need a
I need a proof that you feel the same
I need a, I need a proof that your heart's okay
I need a, I need a proof that you want to stay
And when you, go go go go away, I need a
I need a proof that you feel the same
I need a, I need a proof that your heart's okay
I need a, I need a proof that you want to stay

After hearing something that I've never heard
Talk like a little, be making me unsure
And it comes so vain, like cocaine
Life on the fast lane, and nothing I know remains

You get a piece of his colder heart
For you it's like a ticket to a whole new start

Ay, ay, 

I waited all summer to get to you
Campfire outside, we fell and kissed
There were only few words I said to you
Sun, shade, this lake, one to cherish

Delorean
Saw your name in the sand
Delorean
Make me understand

Serene, clear water, all set for you
Sapphire in your eyes made this turn bliss
There were only a few things I knew from you
Sunset, undress, your name perished
Serene, clear water, all set for you
That fire in your eyes made this turn bliss
There were only a few things I knew from you
Sunset, undress, your name perished
