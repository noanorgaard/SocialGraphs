Count me in, but don't count me out
You can't shut me up, you can't shut me down
Fight through the hurt
Fight through the pain
Without the ache there is no gain
We live our lives for the love of the game

And we will rise
This is our time
Don't let the chances of our lifetime pass us by
And we will rise
This is our time
We'll give this everything we've got
For the love of the game

Reach for a new elevation
And see just how high we can go
Full blown determination
Will take us further than we know
My own anticipation
Keeps the fire from burning out
It's time for domination
No one will ever take us down

Count me in, but don't count me out
You can't shut me up, you can't shut me down
Fight through the hurt
Fight through the pain
Without the ache there is no gain
We live our lives for the love of the game

And we will rise
This is our time
Don't let the chances of our lifetime pass us by
And we will rise
This is our time
We'll give this everything we've got
For the love of the game
'Cause I won't give up
I won't give in

Count me in, but don't count me out
You can't shut me up, you can't shut me down
Fight through the hurt
Fight through the pain
Without the ache there is no gain
We live our lives for the love of the game

And we will rise
This is our time
Don't let the chances of our lifetime pass us by

I don't believe you're dull reaction
What we need's a call to action
Display it in your coldest caption
What we need's a call to action
And at this moment I'm standing forward

I've tried it your way so how do you like me now?
Like me now
How do you like me

Light It Up

Training day is over
It's been laid on the line
I'll give this all I've got
And I'll find my time to shine
I will settle for no less
Than the best I've got to give
Only the strong survive
When they try to take you down

Toe to toe and pound for pound
It's time to step up it's time to throw it down

There's nothing you say that could ever fade me
Serving up another lesson learned
Light it up and let the fire burn
There's nothing you say that could ever change me
Toe to toe and pound for pound
Step right up its time to throw down

The cage awaits this moment
The tension pushes through
The stage is set to showdown
But I'm not turning my back on you
Face to face with the enemy
Giving in to you I refuse
Somebody's gotta win
And I don't know how to lose
You might also like
Toe to toe and pound for pound
It's time to step up it's time to throw it down

There's nothing you say that could ever fade me
Serving up another lesson learned
Light it up and let the fire burn
There's nothing you say that could ever change me
Toe to toe and pound for pound
Step right up its time to throw down
There's nothing you say that could ever fade me
Serving up another lesson learned
Light it up and let the fire burn
There's nothing you say that could ever change me
Step right up its time to throw down

Light it up!

There's nothing you say that could ever fade me
Serving up another lesson learned
Light it up and let the fire burn
There's nothing you say that could ever change me
Toe to toe and pound for pound
Step right up its time to throw down
There's nothing you say that could ever fade me
Serving up another lesson learned
Light it up and let the fire burn
There's nothing you say that could ever change me
Step right up its time to throw 

Back in the day when nothing really mattered to me
I only saw with my eyes what they wanted to see
And everything around me seemed to never change
Looking for an easy way out, someone to blame
Why does it work this way still today?
You wanna take somebody down along the way?
But I won't let that one be me
'Cause I don't want the drama it brings
See, today isn't 'Back in the day' anymore
I know a little more than I did before
So, don't forget before you try bringing me down
What goes around always comes back around

You can't bring me down
Do you hear what I'm trying to say?
You can't bring me down
I'll never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say?
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away
You might also like
So, you think you can see inside my mind?
You probably could if you just took a little time
I know exactly what you're trying to say
Sitting in the stands ain't the same as playing the game
So, I can't comprehend in my mind
Just why we can't leave it all behind
So, come on and stand beside and hold the line
'Cause tonight is the night we cry

You can't bring me down
Do you hear what I'm trying to say
You can't bring me down
I'll never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say?
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away
Oh

Why can't we feel what it takes for us to be real?
Why can't we see what it takes for us to believe?
Why do we say all of these things that bring us down?
You can't bring me down
Do you hear what I'm trying to say?
You can't bring me down
I'll never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say?
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away
It's not like I'm running away
You can't bring me
