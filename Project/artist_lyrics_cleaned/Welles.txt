I reckon time's a healer but it's takin' so long
And that's not me
I can show you all I'm happy, look I'm writing a song
That's all I can be
It's what I'm wantin' to be

Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?

I get hung up in my head, you know it's leading me on
And that's not me
If it comes too much to bear, then I'll be gettin' gone
And that's not me
I'm just lost as can be

Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?


Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can be?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you blue as can
