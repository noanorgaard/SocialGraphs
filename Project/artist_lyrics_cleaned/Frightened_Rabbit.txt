Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

I see the stumbling pinstriped trouser
Flecks of sick on an office shoe
Part of the fatty British average
Who lives in the houses around you

Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

Let's all crowd 'round the cowering body
Throw stocky fingers, bricks and stones
Let's promise every girl we marry
We'll always love them when we probably won't

While the knight in shitty armour
Rips the drunk out of her dress
One man tears into another
Hides a coward's heart in a lion's chest

Man, he breeds although he shouldn't
He's breeding just because he cums
Acts the father for a minute
Till the worst instincts return

Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man
Not here, not here
Heroic acts of man

I have never wanted more, to be your man
And build a house around you
But I am just like all the rest of them
Sorry, selfish, trying to improve

I'm here, I'm here
Not heroic but I try
I'm here, I'm here
Not heroic but I 

So give me soft, soft static
With a human voice underneath
And we can both get old fashioned
Put the brakes on these fast, fast wheels

Oh let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?

Put the wall clock in the top drawer
Turn off the lights so we can see
We will waltz across the carpet
1-2-3-2-2-3

So give me the soft, soft static
Of the open fire and the shuffle of our feet
We can both get old fashioned
Do it like they did in '43

Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

So give me soft, soft static
We won't need no electricity
If we both get old fashioned
We won't have to rely on our memories

Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?

Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with 

Dip a toe in the ocean
Oh, how it hardens and it numbs
The rest of me is a version of man
Built to collapse in crumbs

And if I hadn't come now
To the coast to disappear
I may have died in a landslide
Of rocks and hopes and fears

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?

Up to my knees now
Do I wade? Do I dive?
The sea has seen my like before
Though it's my first and perhaps last time

Let's call me a baptist
Call this a drowning of the past
She is there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?

And the water is taller than me
And the land is a marker line
All I have is a body
Adrift in water, salt and sky

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
