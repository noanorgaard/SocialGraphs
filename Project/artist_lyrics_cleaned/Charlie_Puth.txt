This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, it **** my head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now, honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm

Usually, I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now, you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire; I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you
I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh, now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh-ooh, I loved you 

We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's kama sutra show and tell

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
(Oh, it pulls me closer)
It's so subtle (It's so subtle)
I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healin' that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screamin', "Mercy, mercy, please!"
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

I'm like Mr. Marvin pullin' up to that party singin'
Mercy, Murcielago me
Man, baby you phat, mean that outta respect
Hello, wake up, girl
Kill a nigga with sex
We might turn it to real
All I need to get fly
The way I propel, bottle rocket or jet
A6, Greystone with eight chicks
Guarantee if they act bad, then they rich
I'm like Marvin in his prime
Even though he not around, know the city's still got him
He alive

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
