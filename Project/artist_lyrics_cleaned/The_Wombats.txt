And lock the door if you're home before the sun, oh

Pink, pink lemonade
And does he kiss you 'til your lips explode?
Pink, pink lemonade
And does he take you places I can't afford to go?
Pink lemonade, you know I
Know behind that sugar there's only lies
Lies, lies, lies

Another magical Friday night
I wonder what state you're in
In the powder or in the gin?
This one's ending bad

So please give those recycled house tracks my warmest regards
And, if you bring him home, can you use the spare bedroom? Oh

Pink, pink lemonade
And does he kiss you 'til your lips explode?
Pink, pink lemonade
And does he take you places I can't afford to go?
Pink lemonade, you know I
Know behind that sugar there's only lies
Lies, lies, lies

And that's alright and that's okay
If I can write this song I can play that game
And it's all good with me if I know it's all good with you
'Cause getting lost in the middle of the in-between
Is only half as frightening as it first may seem
So do whatever you must and I'll do whatever it must take

Pink lemonade
Pink lemonade

We could be gigantic, everything I need
Vicodin on Sunday nights
This could be worth the risk, worth a guarantee
This could be the drug that doesn't bite
Just give me a try
Just give me a try
Been kinda hoping you might
G-g-give me a try

I know
Sometimes I lose the plot and I cause a scene
What do you dream of on the west coast?
When my head is aching in GMT
And I don't care why
This apartment's so ice cold
Let London try
It'll never swallow me whole
And I swear

I'm shaving with your toothpaste
And trying to vacuum from the ceiling
The millisecond that you're away
I get the loneliest feeling
Just give me a try

I love this feeling, but I hate this part
I wanted this to work so much, I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong, but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate, there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but, darling, you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps

I hate this feeling, but I love this part
She really wants to make it work and I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide as soon as I get home

Oh, and she hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
It's wrong, but surely worse to leave
And she hits like ecstasy

So free up the cheaper seats
