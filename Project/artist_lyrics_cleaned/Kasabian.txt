Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

Love in technicolor sprayed out on walls
Well I've been pounding at the pavement 'til there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger in a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter, loves a winner to fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

It don't matter, I won't do what you say
You've got the money and the power, I won't go your way
I can't take for the people, they don't matter at all
I'll be waiting in the shadows 'til the day that you fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time  to begin


Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train

Tell me if you're down, throw your weapons to the ground
Keep myself right on this train
Paper on the wire, sold your soul for another one
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this 

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence far too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
'Cos we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand
Let go of my hand

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again
You go your way and
I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we can meet 

Burn my sweet effigy
I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel
I wanna taste, uh-huh
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

And I'm on fire
I'm going
You tell me
I feel it, I say
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn
And I'm on fire
I'm coming, You coming
No hiding my feeling
I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah

Wire me up to machines
I'll be your prisoner
Find it hard to believe
You are my murderer
I'm on fire
Look behind you, there's the falling sky

And I'm on fire
I'm going
You tell me
I feel it, I say
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn

And I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
I feel it, I want it
I'm coming, I tell ya
I caught the bullet from the heavens to the one you serve
I'm going
I'm running
Out to the highest love
I'm wanna hit you to the hip
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
I'm on fire
Move on
You got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake 

Cause I am taking back what's mine
I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone or something
To take me, to take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
You've simply forgotten
How to disappear

Hombre, I got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust
I leave no scar
You say I'm old hat, a fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche, how right you are

I saw something out there on the darkest star
You were sat home chewing on monkey brain

I am not here, I'm just a silhouette
You will never ever ever forget
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
