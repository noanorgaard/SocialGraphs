Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips SWING - and - look - just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell "Savage where the chorus at?!"
