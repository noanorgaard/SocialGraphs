Say, Mr. Sun, could you see your way clear
To helpin' me now?
Please Mr. Sun I think she wants to stay here
So you can see how rain would never do
The two of us need you
I'm beggin' you...

Say, Mr. Sun, oh, she's got such green eyes
She's lookin' so fine
Please Mr. Sun, she's not tellin' me lies
She wants to be mine
Warm this happy day
So she and I can play

Runnin' through hillsides
Rollin' in meadows so green
Lookin' through golden windows
As far as the eye can see
You might also like
Do 'n do-da day
Do 'n do-da day
Do-do do do do
Do 'n do-da day
Do 'n do-da day
Do-do do do
Ah, rain would never do
The two of us need you
I'm beggin' you

Please Mr. Sun
Please Mr. Sun
Please Mr. Sun
Please Mr. Sun
Please Mr.
