I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

"Honey, I love you"
That's all she wrote

See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And how we demonstrated
It to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one to bein' ignored

Be in my eyes
And be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye

Love you back
And I hope it's not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes

'Cause it takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

So be in my eyes

Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night
Baby, come on

If the Sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day?

And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that

Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it 

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn, I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
Only love can dig you out of 

So, later on, the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if
Something drew me closer to her lips
So, picture my surprise when I had tried
To lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down
And I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doin' wrong
It's just what it is
No classy girls, don't kiss in bars like this

No, classy girls don't kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts

When it got cold, ooh-ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah-ah, it can't be done

So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part
