Now that he's gone
You wanna get in my car
Wanna steal my sheets, go a little too far
You're wrong, if you think you can dip out like ya did
And say you're over him
Kissin' ya, kissin' ya
So you want me kissin' ya, huggin' ya, lovin' ya
Well baby I ain't trippin' over all the words that you're throwin' out
I ain't your rebound
(Don't you think we could, it feels so good. Baby we should)
I ain't your rebound
(Baby don't you miss the taste of my kiss, I know you want this)
I ain't your rebound

You're playing it cool
With the sweet talk on your lips
But I ain't a fool, nah
Yeah I know what this is

Now that he's gone
You wanna get in my car
Wanna steal my sheets, go a little too far

And say you're over him
Kissin' ya, kissin' ya
So you want me kissin' ya, huggin' ya, lovin' ya
Well l baby I ain't trippin' over all the words that you're throwin' out
I ain't your rebound
(Just give one night, let me show you why it's different this time)
I ain't your rebound
(Let me show you, what it means to do you tonight)
I ain't your rebound
{Bridge]
I hope that you move on, but I ain't your ride
Ain't your bounce back, go back
To keep him off your mind, no
[Chorus}
'Cause now that he's gone
You wanna get in my car
Wanna steal my sheets, go a little too far
You're wrong, if you think you can dip out like ya did
And say you're over him
Kissin' ya, kissin' ya
So you want me kissin' ya, huggin' ya, lovin' ya
Well baby I ain't trippin' over all the words that you're throwing out
I ain't your rebound
(Don't you think we could, it feels so good. Baby we should)
I ain't your rebound
(Baby don't you miss the taste of my kiss I know you want this)
I ain't your rebound
(Just give me one night, let me show you why it's different this time)
