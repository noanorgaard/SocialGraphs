I'm feelin' frisky, you're feelin' good
I guess the whiskey is doin' what it should
I got the cigarettes, you've got a lighter
And when the sun goes down, we'll start a little fire

Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't ya, baby?
I like 'em crazy

My reputation follows me around
Just makes me wanna give 'em more to talk about
Let's go to town for a little while
I'll be wearin' nothin' but a tattoo and a smile

Ain't no use in tryin' to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain't ya, baby?
You're kinda crazy
Come on

Throw out the bottle and I'll hide the gun

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Everybody says you gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave, you can always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waitin' here this time

Smokin' and drinkin' gotcha' thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'

We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were going to miss
But damn we know it now cause that's all we talk about, smokin' and drinkin'

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely
It's gone before it ever melts the ice

Another vice, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes

Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

'Cause I heard Jesus, he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine

If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shiftin' gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that '55 just like a queen, three on a tree

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doin' it all by hand
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time you put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

If you had something to say, you'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it, and they'd get it three days later

You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they ever found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up any way
I got friends in this town

Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
'Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don't lie too well

Mid-February shouldn't be so scary
It was only December
I still remember
The presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to
Ever get over you

Livin' alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
'Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame
