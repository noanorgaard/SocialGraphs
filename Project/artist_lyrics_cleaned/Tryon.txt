I've got an imaginary shield around me
But nobody's ever really gotten through
I keep thinking that they're gonna break me free
But they never do, no

When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

There's a thickness in the air
Weighing heavy on my heart
Why can't I just fit in?
Why can't I do what everyone else does?
You might also like
People come around like a storm
When you least expect them to
Me? I run for cover when I should
Really face the truth, oh

When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling
But I made myself left out

When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
When somebody's knocking
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying
To love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
I get scared (I get scared)
Don't know how it works (Don't know how it works)
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
(Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?)
I get scared (I get scared)
Don't know how it works (Don't know how it works)
Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?
(Will somebody save me, or will I get burned?)
I get scared (I get scared)
Don't know how it works (Don't know how it works)
Will somebody save me, or will I get... (Will somebody save me?)
