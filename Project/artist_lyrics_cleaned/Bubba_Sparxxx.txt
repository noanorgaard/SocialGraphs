Nowhere, nowhere

I've accepted every challenge and risen to all occasions
The country boy done got 'em shook like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps ol' Bubba's numerals don't fit in y'all's equation
If yo' opinions coincide with that, you oughta save 'em
Cuz' the quoted greatest southern rapper fuckin period
Negative spirits, they only keep you down a myriad
Of Satan's substance is in my system, still my wisdom
Is never once compromised, that's between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners 'cause my mamma
Played in public housing, Opelika, Alabama
But she had a different plan for me, and Russ and Ginger
Thank the Lord for Jimmy Mathis Pops, they must remember
How you held it down when them other clowns disappeared
Taught me how to set the scope, shoot, and leave with the deer
Then made me drink the blood to show me life was precious
The money rose from nowhere 'til somewhere, here's my directions

Can you relate to five kids, six fish sticks on the plate
Or writing Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late
Or to catch the fish, you bait the hook with little Dylan's poo-poo
On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you he will shoot you
Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions
But where I'm from, bein broke's no honorable affliction
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never even voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we tote it
Every firearm from AKs to thirty-thirties
And from live rocks to livestock, they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I chose keys over cattle 'cause the profits way mo'
Might get locked away, though, peddlin' them snow cones
So we keep it simplified with acres of that homegrown
Plus the finest shine that you could find this side of Memphis
From east nowhere to west somewhere still the grind is endless

I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
Beyond the second round of the big dance, all my plans
Of being viewed as somethin special, more than just the other one
Will vanish in the vapors of the plague the South has suffered from
The world's weight plus a ton resting on my shoulders
But what detractors deem my curse is blessed to the beholder
'Cause Eminem's incredible, but did I really have to say this
For y'all to leave my soul at rest and add me to yo' playlist
But this time I may just leap and clear that hurdle, man
'Cause it's gon' be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn
Bubba K I surely am, with that silky kind of sound
Carson, tell yo' folks that I'll be early for this time around
'Cause I've come too far for my own mistakes to quell me
'Cause lookin' back at self-inflicted wounds that ache and ail me
There's nothin they can tell me, get me somewhere in a hurry
If I'm nowhere, let that nowhere be nowhere near a worry
Okey-dokey

I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
I know what it's like to be nowhere
I know what it's liiiiiike
{*Cry Me A River beat*}

You don't have to say what you did
Come on Ki and help me sing

Cry me a river Oh
Cry me a river Oh
Cry me a river Oh
Cry me a river Oh
Cry me a river Oh
I know what it's like to be nowhere 

I left out from mamma's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death, I still manage livin' life
'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say:

I've been travelin' for some time (for some time)
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine (bottle of shine)
On these long dark dusty roads (dusty roads)
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, "This one is for history!"
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's "Yo, you just missed them B"
"This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?"
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin' you two-hundred times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And ten million sold in the name of my deliverance

I've been travelin' for some time (for some time)
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine (bottle of shine)
On these long dark dusty roads (dusty roads)
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together, no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mamma, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say:

I've been travelin' for some time (for some time)

'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank it, couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!

Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!
Ha ha, it's gon' get (ugly - in here!)
Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)

It's gon' get (ugly) say what?
(Ugly, ugly) Say what? (Ugly!) In here! Huh, in here!
