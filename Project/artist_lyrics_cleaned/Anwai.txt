Do you hear me
Calling out your name?
Am I more, am I more
Than just a friend?
'Cause I've been feeling restless
Won't you ease my pain?
Is this more, is this more
Than just a game?

I can make you feel alright now, darling
If you just let me
Make you feel alright now, baby
If you let me in
'Cause you're looking like a dream come true
And though it's not me and you
We can pretend they won't have a clue

So take it away, take it away, take it all away
Take it away, take it away, take it all away
So take it away, take it away, take it all away
Take it away, take it away, take it all away

When the night comes calling
I think of you
I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for it all
When the night comes calling
I think of you
I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for it all
You might also like
I can make you feel alright now, darling
If you just let me
Make you feel alright now, baby
If you let me in
'Cause you're looking like a dream come true
And though it's not me and you
We can pretend they won't

I can make you feel
Take it all away
Take it all away

When the night comes calling
I think of you
I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for it all
When the night comes calling
I think of you
I'm not asking for much
I'm not asking for it all

You say I'm crazy, darling
That I won't last
Say it again that I'm asking
That I'm not asking for it all
They say I'm crazy, darling
That I won't last
Say it again that I'm asking
That I'm not asking for it
