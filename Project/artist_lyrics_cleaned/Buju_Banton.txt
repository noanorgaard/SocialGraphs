Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life of another?
Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill me today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

You can hide from man but not your conscience
Unnu nyam the bread of sorrow, drink the wine of violence
Allowed yourself to be conquered by the serpent
Why you disobey the first commandment?
Walk through the valley I fear no pestilence
God is my witness and him ah meh evidence
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help
You will never escape this judgement

I tell you, all men are created equal
But behind the trigger its a different sequel
Some ah murder people just to collect medals
Stop commit dirty acts for the high officials
You could wash your head until you can't wash no more
It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure
Upper class you could be rich, middle class whether you poor
Only the righteous won't feel insecure
You ever think about your skull getting bored? (buck buck!)

Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

Drinking sulphur bitters won't bitter like your end
Only God can help you, no family no friend
Don't let the curse be upon your children's children
Abednigo, Shadreck, Meshek, Daniel in the den
Jonah in the whale's belly, but him never condemned
Job with the leprosy, and he still reached heaven
He will do for you everything He has done for them
Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow

Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, that they are with you

Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to (yeah)
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life

Who free the people?
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you

It hard, it hard, it hard (yeah)
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (yeah)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (oh god)
We waan go home
Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Those oer hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't dare believe one minute, they don't like you

Why try to make I unhappy
I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
And I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That is the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Look around, who free the people?
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
