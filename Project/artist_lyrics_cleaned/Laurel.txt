Into the Hills we go
I don't know if I could live much more
Didn't know that I could feel this great
Life's to waste
(Higher, higher get, higher, higher)
In the sunlit dawn
If we're lucky maybe God might call
Smoky heaven, feeling on my own

Hold out your arms
Soak it in

On my skin like Demons
Cry with joy
Cause I know Hell follows me
Out here
In the Garden of Angels
I feel what it was like to be free

Didn't know that I could feel this great
Life's to waste
(Higher, higher get, higher, higher)
In the sunlit dawn
If we're lucky maybe God might call
Smoky heaven, feeling on my own
Lost control, get
(Higher, higher get, higher, higher)
Into the Hills we go
I don't know if I could live much more
Didn't know that I could feel this great
Life's too late
