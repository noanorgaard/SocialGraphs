I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found now
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done

That bridge is on fire
Back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave
Where would I be
If this were to go under?
That's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make

It's been a while and you've found someone better
But I've been waiting too long to give this up
The more I see, I understand
But sometimes, I still need you

Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you
Sometimes, I still need you

And I was struggling to get in
Left waiting outside your door
I was sure
You'd give me more

No need to come to me
When I can make it all the way to you
You made it clear, you weren't near
Near enough for me

Heart skipped a beat
And when I caught it you were out of reach
But I'm sure, I'm sure
You've heard it before
Heart skipped a beat

Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

Before it slips away

Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?
I say something loving
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip 

You said you don't have to speak
I can hear you
I can feel all the things you've ever felt before
I said it's been a long time
Since someone looked at me that way
It's like you knew me
And all the things I couldn't say

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body

My young heart chose to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson
The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

And there's no one else
Who knows me
Like you do
What I've done, you've done too
The walls I
Hide behind
You walk through
You just walk through

Well I know all the words
To take you apart
You know I know your heart
I want to mend your heart
You're broke down
Why don't you tell me from the start?
