Where do you find peace
In the middle of the city?
Hard enough to find a friend
When everyone's starting over again
I feel like a child
In a world that seems shapeless
When I am most afraid
Is when I get sucked back in

Yeah, you came here with nothing
And you're leaving with the same
Sometimes the road that you were walking on
Is going the wrong way
Just come as you are
When you leave, you will be changed
Everyday is a gift, everyday is a gift
And it's all slipping away
You might also like
Now, if you leave
Will you feel defeated?
'Cause you didn't take from the city
As much as the city took from you
What if you'd stayed?
What if you'd done what you were thinking?
I'd rather you give up on life in the city
Than giving up on life, too

It must be hard to live
In the midst of all those buildings
Where the changing of the wind
Don't seem a miracle at all
And by the hands of man
It's a maze of bad habits
Where the rabbit in the hat
Is just a train in the fog

Yeah, you came here with nothing
And you're leaving with the same
Sometimes the road that you were walking on
Is going the wrong way
Just come as you are
When you leave, you will be changed
Everyday is a gift, everyday is a gift
And it's all slipping away
Follow your dreams
But beware of the illusions
You won't feel the void in your heart
With a bank statement and a car
What is it worth, what is it worth?
Have you given up on freedom?
You spent your life earning the keys to set you free
When you were free all along

New York City
Where all your girls are pretty
All your men are running from somewhere
Making a name for themselves
Are you running from something
Or did you come from nothing?
Are you testing the Lord
With the cards that you've been
