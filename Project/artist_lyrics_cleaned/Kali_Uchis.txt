I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)

I don't gotta hide, no, I don't got reason to lie
I don't need your drama, I don't need you to survive
You don't gotta say it 'cause I know that you don't like me
You and all your friends can open wide, go on and bite me
I know I'm some shit and I'm cool with it
You can't tell me shit, don't come and share your dialect
Ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
'Cause there's no way that we're gonna stop now

I know it sounds strange, but I used to count change
On the counter at the grocery store, the bags I would arrange
Now his face is looking kinda flustered
He didn't know that I was my own hustler
Baby, understand, I don't need a man
Fuck me over, I'll fuck you worse then take off to Japan
He thought I couldn't cross the street without holding his hand
And that if he did his dirt he'd get off with a reprimand
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Now we're ridin' 'round your city with the top down
Ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Ridin' 'round your city with the top down
'Cause my passenger is pretty, we won't stop now

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it

Time and time again I said I would leave you alone
Stop picking up on the phone
Knock knock on my door, no one's home
If you want me to be yours, you got to make it known
Imma make you work for it like you're on commission
Want to take me out, you better ask permission
Tell them other bitches just to mind their business
I ain't no competition

(Please) don't take it personal, but I don't want to hear it
Yes your words are pretty, the delivery's coherent
But talk is cheap, and see I've got expensive taste
Better hope that I don't catch you lying to my face
Actions speak louder than words
Go and show me what I've heard
If you don't know, you're gonna learn
Just what I deserve

I'm not that jaded baby, lately I'm just misunderstood
Stood by your window 'till the morning rose, morning wood good
Had been forever if I didn't do whatever it was
That broke the straw on top the camel's back, get over the hump
It's what I tell myself to tell you but I'm pressing my luck
Don't mean to press your buttons
Shouldn't have unbuttoned the jeans
I'd make it worse if I admit it didn't mean anything
Or maybe it's just a dream
But let me tell you one thing

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it (you're the only one for me)
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it (Yeah, you best not blow your chance)

Alright baby, I don't know what you think I was doing
But, who's going to treat you better than me?
Let's just be honest here...
I heard you talking to somebody
But shit, what's really going on?
But anyway, just give me a chance
I just want to come back to
