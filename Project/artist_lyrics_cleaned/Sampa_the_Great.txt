It goes like clockwork, Austin, yes we have a problem
How you tryna cover where you from like we forgotten?
Back when we were sipping on our sugar tea for dinner
Back when you was hustling, back when you was struggling
Right before we dared to dream of how we would come up of in
A strange cold world of the lowest of the lowest
You made it but you standing on a pyramid of hopeless
'Cause now you were everybody hope is
Everybody jokers
Everybody know that they provoke this
Try to tell you where they think your goals is
Everybody motives
When you try to dream with what you have
All a sudden fingers pointing see the vultures
Everybody wrote this, everybody mad
Everybody stunted on the chances that they had
 Think of the all expectations everybody had
Took it on your shoulders and wore everybody's bag

Please don't fall that fast
I beg again
Cape don't go that fast
I beg again, let me explain
I might be gorgeous in the darkness
I light my way up from the darkness
Perfection never was me
No hero is, no hero is
Please don't fall that fast
I beg again
Cape don't  go that fast
I beg again
Please don't fall that fast
I beg again

Everybody hero, everybody hero, everybody hero
Everybody hero
With everybody here though

I might be gorgeous in the darkness
I light my way up from the darkness
Perfection never was 

Got up exactly in the age
Probably
The hunger had struck me
The push to stay alive is a part of me
When I wash I wash the pain
So over that my work’s in vain
No access to being out of life
Sometimes the force change
I respect
And I bleed, bleed even if there is no blood
My family washing out my tears
Their water thinner than blood
And I ain’t talk to them in years for them my shit my blood
And now they shot me in the street I thought that we were blood
It’s not enough
Walk my fingers to the born land uh
It’s not enough
This mic I’m spitting on, and my fridge is not enough
I’m an artist, this how long in the streets
Not enough
And when the world stop treating people like they think we ain’t enough

Flawless with no eyes, we’re watching God, I awoke my G
Honest, then I order the revolt that we sought my G
