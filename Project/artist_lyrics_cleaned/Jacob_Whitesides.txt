I didn't know you were an actor
Played every part
Climbed up the ladder
Taking your time
Taking the longer way

But they took your life
From you, sign those papers
I couldn't help, I couldn't save ya
They wrote the lines
They thought you should say

If I could hide you under my cape
Tuck you away in my suitcase
When you get tired of being alone
Anywhere but here is home
It's not in your deal
When you say when I will
Leave behind the world
Faces on film

My favorite scenes are when you're escaping
Finding a place you could be safe in
Hiding your eyes
Cover them with your hair
You might also like
You follow the road
You know where it's winding
You do what your told
Or you truly deciding
Tears me apart
That we had to find a way


If I could hide you under my cape
Tuck you away in my suitcase
When you get tired of being alone
Anywhere but here is home
It's not in your deal
If you're so good, I fear
It's the underneath that's real
Let's leave behind the world
Faces on 

She's got pieces of me
Wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her
Heaven

No, she's not my type at all
No, she's not my type at all

She's got a plastic ring on her left hand from her boyfriend
And a chip on her shoulder from her mom
And she's not my type at all
It's all so right but it's also wrong
Probably be gone by the end of this song
And she's not my type at all
You might also like
She's got pieces of me
Wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her
Heaven

(Ooh)
But she's not my type at all (Ooh)
No, she's not my type at all (Ooh)
No, she's not
No, she's not
No she's not (Ooh)
No, she's not my type at all

I am something else
When she says my name
Heaven bound I lose myself
But she's not my type at all
No, she's not my type at all

She's got pieces of me
Wrapped around her fingers
She's got pieces
Wrapped around her fingertips
Started slow but moving quickly to her
Heaven, heaven
No, she's not my type at all
No, she's not my type at all
No, she's not my type at
