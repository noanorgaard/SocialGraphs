I can see it coming round full circle my friend
On the TV they said they had reported you dead
It was my fault cause I could've sworn that you said
It was easy to find another for your bed

How does it feel to leave me this way
When all that you have's been lost in a day?
Everyone knows, but not what to say
I've been wonderin' now

I've been staring at the hotel ceiling
Drinking everything I've found this evening
Trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely
Start to see this, everyone I know cannot believe this
I'm trying to hold on to the sweetest feeling
So I'll never let you go, don't you leave me lonely now

When my eyes open morning pulls me into the view, no
I guess I'm only acting in the way that you do
Just being alone, no
Only time tells me more than I hope, all that I know is
I'll be finding a fortnight alone and behold
I know I shouldn't have let you go

When the road seems long, let the voices drive you on
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you take on this battleground
I know the road will take you home

When it feels like you're climbing a mountain, gravity's pulling you down
I know its not easy, oh, I know it's not easy (It's not easy, it's not easy)
But just when you're ready to stop, think how it feels at the top
The sun disappears, but you're the light even in the darkest night
Because the stars were meant to shine (Because the stars, they were all meant to shine)
They shine!

When the road seems long (And you can't find the way)
Let the voices drive you on (Can you hear what they say, say?)
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you take on this battleground
I know the road will take you home
Oh, know the road will take you home
(As long as you follow the—)
The road will take (Take, take, take) you homeYou might also
