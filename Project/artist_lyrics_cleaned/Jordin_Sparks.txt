No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free

To admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
You might also like
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
(I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
I'll always have you

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
There's still a part of me in you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh-oh

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken (Yeah, yeah)
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction (Don't look back)
I loved you once, needed protection (No, no)
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
I can't waste time, so give it a moment (I can't waste time)
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done (No need to worry)
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction (Don't you ever look back)
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have 

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow, I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Oh, oh)
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like a battlefield? (Oh-oh)
