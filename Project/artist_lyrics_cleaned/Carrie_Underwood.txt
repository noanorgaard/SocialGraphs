Uhm, we, we had so much fun like recording that song and shooting the video and getting to perform it on various award shows and stuff like that. It's such a great song and I feel like it’s something that so many people can relate to, you know, when you have been married or have been together for a really long time. Uhm, you know, kind of just making that extra effort so hopefully some people heard that song and, and made them wanna, you know, rekindle the fires a little bit. But mainly I just, I really enjoy, ah, that I got to work with one of my really good friends on something like that.See Carrie Underwood LiveGet tickets as low as $
