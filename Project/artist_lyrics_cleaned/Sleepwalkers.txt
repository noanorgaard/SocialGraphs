It's not easy when you're living in the free world
It's not easy when your life is underground
Drinking oughtta be a nuisance stimulation
Everybody needs just a little cocaine
c-c-cocaine
Some days feel like a tuck when you just can't get outta bed
The coffee's on the pot but it just won't ease your head
I need to feel the city lights
I need to feel my engine burn throughout the night
Life can be oh so cruel
And you just can't face your bed
Looking for my only enemy
My mind's on vacation
Someone in my dream is telling me
It's right around the bend
My endorphins will be penalized
Right up until midnight
Serotonin hold tight
Try to make amends

(so I found sun)
