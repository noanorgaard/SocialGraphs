Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pullin' on your hair
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body, baby, this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fuckin' runnin', feel the heat between us two

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's gettin' hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm-I'm gon' ride
On you, baby, on you, lady, all night, all-all night
I'm gon' make you feel that lovin', gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip-top all the way down to your feet

Yeah, girl, we can go slow (Oh, woah, yeah)
Yeah, we can go slow (Woah, woah, woah, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah)

Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel, spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell, turn it up, sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust, but everybody we know does

That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin'
Not everybody knows what we're made of, but
Everybody we know does

Damn, pretty girl, you went and done it again
You gone and turned your sexy all the way up to ten
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a Fireball shot
You got me all high, head spinning around and around

Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Then slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
