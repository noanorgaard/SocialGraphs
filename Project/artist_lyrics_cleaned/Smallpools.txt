City fines when you are broke
You taste falafel on your coat

So hang it up and let it slide

With somebody else now
Does he keep you in the lines

I feel that you might have always been right
And we may not find partners in crime
Better in life than we've had this whole time
So if you're alone just watching the sky
Losing your mind and you don't know why
And you wanna try going for one more ride

I could steer from the passenger side
While you switch the song
From your cracked iPhone
As we fall from each other
On quest for new lovers yeah

State I'm in right now
Salt drips from her brow
No more days without
Makes me feel so right
I can do no wrong
We'll keep going strong

I've got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks
And I give no fucks when I'm with you
Got all my money on you
And though my dollars are few
I feel like a million bucks, a million bucks

I used to be a skeptic non-believer
But now it's changed, you're worth your weight in gold

But you led 'em to our hideout
Forced their way inside, now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender
But I could go all night right here
Between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send the message
We're saying "give it up, give it up"

We've got no place to go
Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming

So take a breath and calm down

A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you've got your nest egg, you've got your nest egg

But it's a wonderful feeling
And I built it this way
So I could cherish the heartache
When all of the DJs & Porsches steal her away

I need another exemption before I can rise
A contrived bit of passion but soon it'll die
There's no time to appreciate it
Oh it's killing my flow
Fly away to your castle
The science of letting go, oo-oh

Steal her away

I think I'll pass on the summer
Don't wanna fall for it this time
I'm drowning, drowning, drowning down
And yeah I might miss your mother
I fantasize about her sometimes
Drowning, drowning, drowning down
There's nothing left to do
But let the waves crash over you

So tell me why
If I'm as bad as all those things you call me every night
You want me in your life just to drag around
I'm never living up to what you thought you found

So tell me why
Why you're still here and I'm still here
And we're still taking time
Out of our busy lives just to fuck around
Spewing words we both could live without
