There's no reasons, no excuses
There's no secondhand alibis
Just some black ink on some blue lines
And a shadow you won't recognize


In the meantime, I'll be waiting
For twenty years, twenty more
I'll be praying for redemption
And your note underneath my door
And your note underneath my doorYou might also 

I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh, but I want to
How I do

Slowly counting down the days
'Til I finally know your name
Ooh, the way your hand feels 'round my waist
The way you laugh, the way your kisses taste

I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh, but I want to
How I do

The leaves have changed a time or two
Since the last time the train came through
I got my ticket and I'm going to go
Home

My father's father's blood's on the track
A sweet refrain drifts in from the past
I got my ticket and I'm going to go

So here's my hope, my tired soul
And here's my ticket, I want to go
Home

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Oh, think twice
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she came and stood right by me
With the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

So, Billie Jean is not my lover (She's just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She's just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my 

Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give, the more I get back
Oh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you

Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
Oh, I don't love you, but I always will
I don't love you, but I always will
