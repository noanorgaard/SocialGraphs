Patient suicide
Is what you know to feel inside
Fake it til' you’re gone
You can’t recognize yourself anymore

Satan is your master now
Satan is your master now
Satan is your master now
Satan is your master now

Bleed inside for him
Bleed inside for him
Bleed inside for him
Bleed inside for him

Love evades every thought
And pills nullify my restless mind
And I hate myself but I couldn’t hate you
Even if I tried, even if I tried, even if I tried
'Cause love evades every thought
And pills nullify my restless mind
And I hate myself but I couldn’t hate you
Even if I tried, even if I tried, even if I tried

Hiding in my purest failure I attempt to understand
Why hate and love seem so different but are one and the same
Falling out of grace, I know it'll never change
Even if I tried, even if I tried, even if I triedYou might also 

Take my corpse and my child too
Leave me without anything
I want to be as I was before
Just a lifeless form
Slip a line of Percocet
School shootings on the TV screen
Think of the people that you love
Reaching out for anything
Clinging tight to their crosses
Knowing that they’ll rest in pain
Pull the nails from your own skin
And die effortlessly

Goodbye mom, goodbye son
Goodbye hell, goodbye God
Goodbye flesh, goodbye church
Goodbye hell, goodbye death
