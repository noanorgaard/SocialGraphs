I'm having a me party, a party by myself
A me party, I dont need nobody else
I'm having a me party, I'm the first and last to show
There's no one at this party that I don't already know

I'm not gonna sit around by myself and wait for you
Haven't you heard? "One is the new two"
I'm gonna make a scene, I'm gonna make a fuss
Tonight I'm gonna celebrate with just the one of us

I'm having a me party, I don't need no invitation
A me party, I just love the conversation
Me party, but no one else there to
You do the math, frog, it means I'm not with you

I won't lie, there are times when I wish I was with you
There are days when all this girl can see is a world that's made for two
At times like this I feel all alone and it's like nobody cares
But I only have to call my name and darling I'll be there
You might also like
I'm having a me party, haven't I seen you here before?
A me party, I'm the last one on the dance floor
Me party, a party just for one
Me party, it's a solo Mardi Gras
Having a me party, I'm such good company
A me party, I'll save the last dance for me

Ooh
Oh, what happens at the me party
Stays at the me
