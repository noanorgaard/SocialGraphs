I was once the most mystical man in all Russia
When the royals betrayed me they made a mistake
My curse made each of them pay
But one little girl got away
Little Anya, beware, Rasputin's awake

In the dark of the night, evil will find her
In the dark of the night, just before dawn
Revenge will be sweet
When the curse is complete
In the dark of the night
She'll be gone

I can feel that my powers are slowly returning
Tie my sash and a dash of cologne for that smell
As the pieces fall into place
I'll see her crawl into place
Do svidanya, Anya, your grace
Farewell

In the dark of the night, terror will strike her
Terror's the least I can do
In the dark of the night, evil will brew (Ooo)
Soon she will feel
That her nightmares are real
In the dark of the night
She'll be through
In the dark of the night, evil will find her (Find her)
In the dark of the night, terror comes true (Doom her)
My dear, here's a sign
It's the end of the line
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night

Come, my minions
Rise for your master
Let your evil shine

In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
Find her now, yes
Fly ever faster
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
She'll be 

Last week I-
Alright
I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
You ever gotten so stoned, you've seen god?
Is when the sun comes shining through

Last week I was depressed as fuck
My dad got drunk and ran over my mom with a truck
She was dead on the street but her ass was still fat
So he got out the truck and started to fuck

Listen to your parents
Don't do drugs kids
I tried crack and woke up with my dick in the fridge

Your grades will drop
Your life will stop
Next thing you know
You're getting clapped by a cop
Put down the crack and pick up the cheeks
Half of y'all niggas are using soap to wack your meat
Whatever you do is better than picking up the loser leaf before age three

Last week I was depressed as fuck
I nutted inside of a chicken
Now I'm hearing clucks
It was an accident
I got fucked up drinking McDonalds Sprite and ODing on Starbucks

Listen to your parents
Don't do crack
I got fucked up and milked on my aunts back
Then I walked in my nephew's room
And he was whacking his Jonathan to Youngboy's diss track

I don't get bitches so I bought a Viagra and I grabbed my stepmom took her to the Niagara
Crushed it up
Put it in her Sprite Cranberry
And now I'm getting sucked up in the Acura (Lean on me)
I went to the vet and popped nine percocets
Clapped a dead rat and bought him a Berkin bag
I'm distorted
I'm fucked up from all the lines I snorted
Got a rat pregnant just to have an abortion
Now I'm stressed
No sleep, I didn't get any rest
I had a baby rat off of fifteen lines of crack
Off topic but sometimes I step on the cracks on purpose just to break my mamas back
Back on topic, on the rat
I got drunk as hell and beat the bitch with a baseball bat
It died in midair, and landed on my stairs
I looked real close and it had rainbow hair
Last week I was depressed as fuck
I did crack until I shit blood
But that's none of your business
I was sad because Santa sent me a dick pic for Christmas
I was seven years old, and I didn't like boys
All I wanted was pocket pussy's and sex toys
At the mall
I sat, on his lap
And he reached in his pocket and grabbed an Android
He snapped a picky of my dicky and I cried
He said "Shut the hell up or I'll make you fuck Woah Vicky"
Nobody wants that so I wiped my tears
And I zipped my lips and hopped on a reindeer
I blacked out
And I woke up in my bed
My mom was screaming my name
And her face was red
"Siah look looky
It's Santa Clause
His mouth is open and he want's some milk and cookies"

Last week I-
Alright
This week I watched Fortnite porn
I took an ounce of Oxycontin, my ass was throbbing
I started seeing shit
Looked to my left
And Youngboy started shaking his cheeks with Batman and Robin
Listen to your parents
Don't do crack
I got fucked up and laid on the train tracks
Blacked out
Opened my eyes
And god was extending his arms to give me dap

Ha-ha!
Where's 6ix9ine?
He's got a record that's longer than mine
He snatched his hand back
And told me that he doesn't allow rats to exist in the sky
He picked me up by my cheeks
And he threw me back to earth
I woke up face first on the street
A guy walked by
When god cracked the sky, he said
"I'll see you in a week"

I see the crystal raindrops fall
Jesus fucking Christ in the comments
And the beauty of it all
Is when sun comes shining through

I see the crystal raindrops fall
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
And the beauty of it all
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Is when the sun comes shining through
Alright, alright
Last week I- uh, hmm, alright
This week I- ha, shit!

Last month I was depressed as fuck
I drunk a pound of bleach and then I fucked a Milwaukee buck
My stomach fucked up, and then I threw up blood
And then I went outside and seen Elmer Fudd

Listen to your parents, don't do crack
I got fried and took kids with Mike Jack

And then I went upstairs and then opened my eyes
And Mike Jack was tappin' shit from the back
Not gonna lie, that nigga's crazy
We did drugs, got drunk, and caught rabies
Went outside and him and 6ix9ine were standing on top of a building about to chuck a baby
Then I realized, I was too fried
My dad woke up, cheeks out, and as high as the sky
Sometimes you get bored and play with your ass hairs
That's something that you can't deny

I see the crystal raindrops fall
Still got it, still fucking got it
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes
