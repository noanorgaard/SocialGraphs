Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy pressed against your arm
I adore you

All of my money is spent on these nights, just so we can hang out
Squeezing in and out of these dresses, I wanna be found
By you
Found by you

Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy pressed against your arm
I adore you
I adore you
You might also like
I kick the gutter in tight shorts, basketball courts
Watch me watch him talk to girls
I'm known as a right-hand slugger
Anybody else wanna touch my lover?

Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy pressed against your arm
Just to adore you
I adore
