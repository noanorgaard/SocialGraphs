We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light

Man, they really ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
I used to pop blues with my lil' chick
I call her boo 'cause her real one I will forget
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS
What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?
Oh no, no these women ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
Try to tell me Adderall make her get a rush
Used to use it to study until she fell in love
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
Told her "Nah, you lying, 'cause you don't eat enough"
Nah, nah, nah
These women ain't serious
She sprinkled a little something up in her liq'
Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched
Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
But for now, they're wild
They rather get it in

In her purse where her hand go
She disperse by the handful
Coco make her go up
Nothing popping, pop a Xan' when she laying low
Bars to break, so many bars to break
She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake
She like "Oh my God, I'm on the moon and I'm lit"
And my particular moon like a platoon and shit
You know the hitters that I'm dealing with
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip
And my position to give my lyrics to little kids
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic
We're all living with small demons
We're all sinning, it's all similar
Broads with us and they bong hitting
Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with
The really insecure ones look good in here, right?
Nothing fill the void of a little pill
A little shot, she ain't shy when the liq' spill
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
Beside that the lime light be so real
Let me tell you about the bitches I be chilling with
Told me nobody love her, that's why she cut her wrist
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close
That's why she want to get high 'cause she be feeling low
Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke
So I could numb her insides and we will never know

Huh , Only hope I had was selling dope
It was on my grind cause times were harder than a cellar floor
My mamma taught me never steal but never tell'em folkes
I grew up lookin up to the niggas that was selling coke
Oh ! I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was gettin saved by the Glock 9
By the minute , I was gettin paid like the hotline
Service raw , fiends was calling , we was dot com
Well connected , well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted , Well rejected , And now they regret it
Ain't get my message , was no signal when I was texting
The nigga I was callin was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I moove with agression , use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
Now throw that pass i'll be the quarterback
Me & Folarin MMG gonn' bring that warner back !
