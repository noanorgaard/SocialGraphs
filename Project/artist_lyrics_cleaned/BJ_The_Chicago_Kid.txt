Amazing grace
It's hard to say no when it's looking so good in my face
Girl all them curves got me on a swerve when I'm tryna drive straight
If you called me on another day, baby girl I probably woulda took that cake
Cause every nigga love birthday cake

And every time I come around I can tell you be looking at me
And I can tell you be wondering if I'm really loving what I see
It'll be wrong if we get along, because I know me
But still I try and be strong, say "b keep your G on", but she ain't tryna hear me

She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

Trouble in my way
Whispered in my ear, she didn't have good uhh, since last May
And she know I could change all that if I want to, right now, today
Straight put her in her place, make her ass wanna stay
Now I can never get away

Cause every time I come around I can tell you be looking at me
And I can tell you be wondering if I'm really loving what I see
It'll be wrong, if we get along, because I know me
But still I try and be strong, say "b keep your G on", but she ain't tryna hear me
She ain't tryna hear me, she ain't tryna hear me

She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight

Hot as hell in the fur coat, walls like Jericho
Pussy like hurr ya go
Loud like church folk, heavy like work load
How you like miracles?
Never sang, Kirk F, bang like Kirko
Ankle like Kurt came back like Derrick Rose
She always get in her own way
When I try, she always say
"Hey I don't wanna get saved, don't wanna be saved"
Pray that one of these days she'll wanna behave
Keep my head up, I wrap the silver round the cloud
I went to junior church, little children running round
I like what he gave ya, I'm just tryna save ya
I got something saved up in case you come around

She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'

To stay focused, yeah, I even go to church
Put in overtime, even when it hurts
