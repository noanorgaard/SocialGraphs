Get ready, they're coming for you

As this house became a prison
I served a sentence without choice
And my old friend became the warden
The one who locked away my voice
"But we grew up together
And how did I let you get this close?"
Your warm eyes, they turned to fire
And said "Boy, you're nothing but a host"
You might also like

The forest then told me
"It's time you meet the ones
Who live where sky meets sea"

Who live where sky meets sea"

You better watch out, there are giants in the sky
Get ready, they're coming for you

And they're coming for you
They're coming for you
They're coming for
