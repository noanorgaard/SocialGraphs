When I hear that wind and I think of Spring
Underneath an open window, a carved out sign and
Often I would fight with my mind
Saltwater brine where you hung your crown
When you washed your eyes in last night's tea
I thought you might come out from the dream to find that

If I was a boy at sea
I would be swinging from a broken tree
I would be down on my back looking up at stars at night
And if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens (If I was a boy, if I was a boy)
You know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes (If I was a boy)

Underneath the pine grew a patch of thyme
That I burned for six days in the sun
'Til I heard the distant sound of drums
Oh, the queen had come and the King had died
And my forehead burned but I closed my eyes
And my forehead burned but I closed my, closed my eyes

(Before I go I've got to run down the street to the market cove) And if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens
You know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes (Where I could find six seeds to bring back to the yard and plant underneath the birch tree)
If I was a boy at sea (No white skies or red sunlight)
I would be swinging from a broken tree (In the saltwater brine)
I would be down on my back looking up at stars at night (My forehead burned but I closed my eyes)
(Whoa, now you've got to go) And if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens
You know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes

And now I see that you fell asleep again
You've been riding this train since 2 A.M
Like the circle of fifths you drew in school
The loop line takes you round and through

Did I catch you there on a bicycle?
Ten steps away from Osaka-jo
Spoke to you there in Mishima
On that last train I felt the stars

And now I see that you fell asleep again
You've been riding this train since 2 A.M
Like the circle of fifths you drew in school
The loop line takes you round and through
And now I see that you fell asleep again

Like the circle of fifths you drew in school
The loop line takes you round and through

In Osaka I saw you last
Your face pressed up against the glass
Across the tracks you're looking out
As bullets pass behind your back
And I tried to catch your eye and then
Walk past you as the train came in
But I missed you there and lost my mind
The morning crowd pushed me behind

And now I see that you fell asleep again
You've been riding this train since 2 A.M
Like the circle of fifths you drew in school
The loop line takes you round and through
And now I see that you fell asleep again
You've been riding this train since 2 A.M
