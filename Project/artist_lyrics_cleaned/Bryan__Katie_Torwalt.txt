God, let Your fire
Burn in my soul
Come and take over
All my control

Burn in my spirit
Burn in my soul
Oh God, burn in me

God, let Your fire
Burn in my soul
Come and take over
All my control

Burn in my spirit
Burn in my soul
Oh God, burn in me
Burn in my spirit
Burn in my soul
Oh God, burn in me

Let Your Spirit
Come and fill me
Let my heart come fully alive
Let Your presence overwhelm me
Let Your glory come alive
Let it come
Let it come

Burn in my spirit
Burn in my soul
Oh God, burn in me
Burn in my spirit
Burn in my soul
Oh God, burn in
