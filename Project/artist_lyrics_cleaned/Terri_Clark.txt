I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

I wanna drink tequila down in Tijuana
Say, "why not" when somebody says, "hey do you wanna"
I wanna get my heart broke once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

I wanna spend today, every now and then
Just doing what I wanna do
When I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)
Anytime I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

See Niagra Falls, fight City Hall
Feel good in my skin, beating the odds with my back to the wall
Trying to rob Peter without paying Paul
I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all, I wanna do it 

I could wash my car in the rain
Change my new guitar strings
Mow the yard just the same as I did yesterday
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do

Maybe when I don't have so much going
Or quite so many irons in the fire
I'll take the time to miss you like you're hoping
But now I can't put forth the effort it requires
I'd love to talk to you, but then I'd miss Donahue
(updated version: but Springer's on at two)
That's right, I got better things to do

I could wash my car in the rain
Change my new guitar strings
Mow the yard just the same as I did yesterday
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do

Check the air in my tires
Straighten my stereo wires
Count the stars in the sky or just get on with my life
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do
I got better things to
