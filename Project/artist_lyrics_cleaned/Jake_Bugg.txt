So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay

He's down in the kitchen, drinking White Lightning
He's with my momma, they're yelling and fighting
And it's not the first time praying for silence
But something is changing, changing, changing

So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay

Where soul feels
Down in the valley where the church bells cry

Peace and love in a future
Bright sacrifice

Never broken

Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Travelin' street that I did not go
Wheels locked on to the winter lope
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Woah, I'm one
Woah, I'm one
I'm

Something as simple as this?
Something as simple as this

All the while you were stood here waiting
For me, girl

Tried liberation of my own free will
But it left me looking to get higher still
Oh, and the answer, well, who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this?
God knows how I could have missed
Something as simple as
