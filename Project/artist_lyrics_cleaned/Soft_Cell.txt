Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
You might also like
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go

Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh

Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh
Tainted 
1 ContributorSay hello, wave goodbye - 7" single version LyricsStandin' at the door
Of the Pink Flamingo
Crying in the rain
It was a kind of so so love
And I'm gonna make sure
It doesn't happen again
You and I, it had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were a sleep around
A lost and found
And not for me I fear
Take your hands
Off me, please
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look in my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
We tried to make it work
You in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit
But it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less
And now your life's a mess
So insecure you seem
Well I put up with all the scenes
And this is one scene
That's goin' to be played my way
Take your hands
Off me
I don't belong to you, you see
Take a look in my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Under the deep red light
I can see the make up sliding down
Well hey little girl
You will always make up
So take off that
Unbecoming frown
What about me? Well
I'll find someone
Who's not going cheap
In the sales
A nice little house wife
Who'll give me a steady life
And won't keep going off the rails
Take your hands
Off me, please
I don't belong to you, you say
And take a look in my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
We were born before the wind
Who were we to understand
We were born before the wind
Say goodbye
Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow
Say good bye
And I'm trying, trying, trying
To say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain my darling
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain my darlingYou might also
