I got this need for you
Forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away
We only yesterday were worlds apart

I got this thing for you
If you come closer I can whisper in your ear
And if you wanna walk away
I'll tell you all the things I know you wanna hear

I'll come closer
To you if you
Come over
I know we'll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down

Why don't you step to me?
You know I like it in the bath when it's bubbly
And-a-when-a-come-a-to-ya-kisses I like gluttony
Even though I got a reputation unaccompanied

What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game

Baby, I'm thinking it over
What if the way we started made it something cursed from the start?
What if it only gets colder?
Would you still wrap me up and tell me that you think this was smart?
'Cause, lately, I've been scared of even thinking 'bout where we are

I wanna get you in my spaces
I wanna take you different places
I know the touring is romantic
I know you see me as a frantic girl
But I can give you what you want
I know you like the way I held my temper
When I gave you to the world, gave you to the world
I can be your heart to let go

'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home

I know I messed with your head
It was just when I left you
When I was just blowing up when I said
"Remember when I loved you right before that tour?"
You said you didn't want to see me anymore
And then when I got home when I played that show in L.A
All your shit was gone
It was the only time I thought I'd made a mistake
And when I only want to hold you
I thought I wanted you to hold me

Maybe that means we'll fall from grace

Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to somethin' that you don't understand

My words can come out as a pistol
And I'm no good at aimin'
But I can aim it at you

Thinking what you're gonna say
'Cause everything's a game, always tryna calculate
Trying to look smart, but not too smart to threaten anything they say

But it's all the same, I could have foreseen
