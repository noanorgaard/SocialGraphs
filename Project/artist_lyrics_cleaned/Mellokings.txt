Tonight, tonight, more than any time before
This heart of mine seems to need you so much more
The touch of your lips, the thrill of your embrace

Well, if my wish should come true, until our life is through
I'll have you, near, to have, to hold and to love

I'll miss you so 'til you're in my arms again
With all of my heart, I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever as I love you tonight
