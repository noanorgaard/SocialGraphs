Are you saying we're not talking?

What are you saying?

What are you saying?
I'm saying:

I feel bad, that you feel bad
About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad
About what I said, about what you said
About me not being able to share a feeling

If I thought that what you thought
Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts
Then my reaction to your reaction, to my reaction
Would have been more revealing

I was afraid that you'd be afraid
If I told you that I was afraid of intimacy
If you don't have a problem with my problem
Maybe the problem's simply co-dependency
Yes I know, that now you know
That I didn't know, that you didn't know
That when I said, "No," I meant, "Yes, I know"
And that now I know that you knew, that I knew you adored me

I was wrong to---

Say you were wrong to---

Say I was wrong about---

You being wrong

When you rang to say that---

The ring was the wrong thing to bring---

If I meant what I said
When I said, "Rings bored me"
I'm not mad that you got mad that I got mad
When you said I should go drop dead

If I were you and I'd done what I'd done
I'd do what you did
When I gave you the ring
Having said what I saidI feel bad, that you feel badI feel badlyAbout me feeling bad, about you feeling badabout youAbout what I said, about what you saidFeeling badly about meAbout me not being able to share a feelingFeeling badly about youI thought If I thought that what you thoughtyou thoughtWas that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughtsI reacted shallowlyThen my reaction to your reaction, to my reactionWhen I reacted to youWould have been more revealingI'm not mad

When I gave you the ringBut I'm not youHaving said what I saidSaid what I said
But now it's out in the open

Now it's off our chest

Now it's 4AM
And we have therapy tomorrow
It's too late to screw
So let's just get some
