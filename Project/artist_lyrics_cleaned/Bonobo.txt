Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
And looking at people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme or no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now

It's seasonal, nobody knows
We'll make it known somehow
Just you and me, and we can see
Small machines and sunrise

Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
Pictures of people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme and no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now

Pictures of people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm
And we've got no rhyme and no reason now

Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
Lookin at people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme and no reason now
We've got the time of our lives 

Put it back together
Make it good, if I could
If I could

Breathe in the future, breathe out the past
Savour this moment, as long as it lasts, let me tell you

Put it back
Piece by piece

If you stayed over, I'd make you so sweet
I'd make you remember, baby, from your head to your feet
And if you go now, then we'll never know how it ends

Make it good
Make it good
Make it good
