Go take this boat and drive it out into the sea
Go fly this plane so high that I won't know what's real
Go paint the sky so red that I won't wanna feel
What my mama and my daddy said was real

'Cause I can feel it (feel)
I can see it (see it)
I wanna show anybody who wants to feel it
'Cause I can feel it (feel)
I can see it (see it)
Now I won't be there to see

Who's got something, got something to say
Who's got something, got something to say

Can't you see it in your thoughts?
Can you reach it, does it make you wanna walk?
Can you taste it in the feeling that you got?
Tell me something over nothing, ain't so wrong

'Cause I can feel it (feel)
I can see it (see it)
I wanna show anybody who wants to feel it
'Cause I can feel it (feel)
I can see it (see it)
Now I won't be there to see

And you don't know is that I'm feeling strong
I'll have my eyes set on you forever

Who's got something, got something to say
Who's got something, got something to say
Who's got something, got something to say
Who's got something
If you only, only, only
