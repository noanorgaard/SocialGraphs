So don't hold back
And I'll get to greeting you good
Voice breaks
Feeling like I thought it would
Mornings with me
Oh I cannot say
As long as you know it then lets get on with the day

Let's unwind
Don't worry your mind
There's paradise waiting for us in summertime
The warm thoughts set your tension's aside
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime
When you look in my eyes you'll find the pleasure is mine
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime
When I'm making you smile then it's the perfect delight
It's paradise waiting for us in summertime
You might also like
Get inside
Because you're never often enough
Feeling right
Get's in my faults through the rough
While I'm away
I cannot wait
Now, don't you be nervous my love, it's for you to take

So don't hold back
And I'll get to treating you good
Voice breaks
Feeling like my heart is shook
Mornings with me
Oh I hope you stay
As long as you know it then it's the the time and the place

Let's unwind
Don't worry your mind
There's paradise waiting for us in summertime
The warm thoughts set your tension's aside
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime
When you look in my eyes you'll see the pleasure is mine
There's a paradise waiting for us in summertime
When I'm making you smile then it's the perfect delight
It's paradise waiting for us in
