All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like, come on, make me feel alive

(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)


Meet me under shining lights
I've been waiting right here all my life
Feelings you can't deny that you're living
Open up your eyes
And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
Come on, make me feel until the pain don't matter
Every second here makes my heart beat faster
Finally think I found what I'm chasing after
You might also like

In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like, come on, make me feel alive

(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)

All alone, just the beat inside my soul
Take me home, where my dreams are made of gold
In the zone, where the beat is uncontrolled
I know what it feels like, come on, make me feel alive

(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
I know what it feels like, come on, make me feel alive

(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
(Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, feel alive)
