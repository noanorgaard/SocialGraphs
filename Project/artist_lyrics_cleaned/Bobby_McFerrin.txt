Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry
Be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
But don't worry
Be happy, look at me, I'm happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry
Be happy
'Cause when you worry, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry
Be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
But don't worry
Be happy, be happy now
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass, whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried
I'm
