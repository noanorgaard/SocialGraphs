Let's go get stuck in the fever
낯설어질 ego
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Can't shake off the fever
넌 더 원하게 될 걸
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh (Ayy)

Deep down in your soul (Yeah)
좀 더 집중해 봐, breathe in
Something to believe in
So damn spiritual (Ayy, ayy)
Just see, nothing matters
널 깨울 tomorrow

Here's your Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday preacher
Be my runaway, runaway, runaway
Runaway dreamer
Be mine (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday preacher (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
