Kitty: YOU FAIL ME AGAIN
Lil Cody: I'm sorry queen
Kitty: SO YOU LET HIM GO
Lil Cody: yes
Kitty: MORE LIKE YES QUEEN
Lil Cody: lemme tell ya something

Listen savage queen been waiting years to redeem
Now you got back just to one hack or a bat
You're a liar can't you see you don't like pink
Your not an angel expect me to gang her but
It ain't true and you always say "Yes I love you'
Well that ain't true queen of savage
Your nothing, nothing but average
I rather have problems better than this
This unbelievable ish
Dont talk to me like that im the savage queen
You dont say that just cuz you own the streets
And its possible in a gossip girl like me  you see
Im the savage queen bruh nose looking like a duck
Little fuck
You suck at rapping bro
You have a bow
You tryna roast me i roast ya back
You been a fuck
Im no duck
Not mr. quacker
You threatend to hack her
NopeYou might also
