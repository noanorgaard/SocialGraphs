Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got something we can start tonight
Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback

Come on baby, shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my lock screen'
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we've got the beat, let's drop it

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
Tattoos, cut-offs, and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works

Red sky faded to black
A couple cans deep in a six-pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us

With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Killed the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around, we could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my backseat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast

One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didn't care if we were spinnin' wheels

Here and gone in a flash
Yeah, we were messin' around, we could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my backseat
And no way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas

Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Freefallin' Small Town Saturday Night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream
Paradise City, where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time

Just for One More Day, What Do You Say?
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
Let's take a drive, you and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're

Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss would do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
'Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up

I get sick of the sound of my own voice
When I get a couple drinks in me
I gotta admit, the way you got me whipped
You know it's kinda embarrassing
I'm tired of the drama, so hey, little mama, I'm hopin' you wanna
So tell me you're gonna be on your way

And shut me up by showing up

Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

I'd tell him that it's over
