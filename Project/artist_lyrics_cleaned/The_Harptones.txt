1 ContributorThe Dream Lyrics
9:30 in the A.M., wakin' up with my hands gripped
Like I fell asleep playin', sippin' rum in a pineapple
Chillin' in Grenada, cravin' curry goat on a boat on my way to Jamaica
Smokin' big ass blunts and papers on a helicopter straight to the top, see you later
Reel Wolf be the team, The Wolfpack is my family
Complicated mind, way too hard to understand me
Posted up with my DJ eatin' cereal up in my PJs
Super NES, I'm playin' DK, bumpin' Wu-Tang, beatin' haters with my belt
Like I'm Pootie Tang, have these bitches screamin' "Dealt!"
Smack a Gucci Gang rapper with a Walmart shirt
That shit sound way too clean to clean that dirt
Berserk is how I feel in my everyday life
Unpredictable like shootin' some dice, come on

I'll take this world up in my palm 'cause life is but a dream
I'm feelin' good just like I should, there's nothing stopping me
I'll take this world up in my palm 'cause life is but a dream

I'm in the green fuckin' an Instagram bitch
Nut on her face, then teleport her real quick
Jump out the window, landed on a Pegasus
Collectin' rings like it's a game without the Genesis
Goin' through the sky, smokin' loud, creatin' clouds
Lucid feelings out here while I'm laughin' at all these clowns
I'm at The Oscars gettin' head by some famous actress
I'm in a mansion in The Hamptons gettin' pussy on a floatin' mattress
And now the government tryna get me, duckin' and dodgin' as they swingin' with a needle tryin' to inject me
Grab a Karen as a human shield to protect me, run her husband over in a new stolen Bentley
I'm on a big budget high-speed chase with a corona mask on to conceal my face
Gunshots startin' to sound like some EDM bass, don't know my fate, I hope I don't die before I wake

Ooh, I'm feelin' good just like I should, there's nothing stopping me
I'll take this world up in my palm 'cause life is but a dream
I'm feelin' good just like I should, there's nothing stopping me
