And the way you sit in that chair
In tight pants, no underwear, camel toe, with no hair
I love you manicure, your pedicure, what they hate about you I do adore

She ball hard play all sports, luxury of all sorts
Shoe game so insane and them pocketbooks is uncalled for

Still, other cats be thinkin' with their penis
