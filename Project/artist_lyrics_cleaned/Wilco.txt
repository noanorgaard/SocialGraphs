Maybe you still love me
Maybe you don't
Either you will or you won't
Maybe you just need some time alone
I will try to understand
Everything has its plan
Either way
I'm gonna stay
Right for you

Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will roll away
Maybe I won't be so afraid
I will understand
Everything has its plan
Either wayYou might also 

Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon
Oh I'm bragging
I'm always in love

When I let go of your throat, sweet throttle
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
Will I catch the moon, like a bird in a cage
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love

I don't get the connection
This is only a test
I hope I do my best
You know I won't forget

When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
When I soak so long I forget my mother

You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it

Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I'll say what this means to me
I'll do what I can
Impossible Germany

The fundamental problem
We all need to face
This is important
But I know you're not listening
Oh, I know you're not listening

If this was still new to me
I wouldn't understand
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
But this is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face

That need to be erased
Nothing more important than to know
Someone's listening
Now I know
You'll be listening
