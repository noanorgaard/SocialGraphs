Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

And our hands, they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same as we are
We'll still sing our song (Ooh-oh)
When our hair ain't so blonde (Ooh-oh)
And our children have sung, we were right (Oh)

They'll sing "Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I" (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)

And my feet start to thump
Yeah, the feeling is dreamin' around
You'll be the one
Make me hurt, make me come
Make me feel like I'm real and alive

(Oh, and a-one, two, three, four!)

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be

Take my past and take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

Take my heart and take my hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, heal, heal

Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh
Oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

They keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
These sirens
Sirens don't come our way

Or we'll be
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
All run run running away
When sirens they come our way

It's raining down
It's raining on someone's fears
Raining down, no
I've heard the rain is the city's tears
But these sirens
These sirens are all I hear
