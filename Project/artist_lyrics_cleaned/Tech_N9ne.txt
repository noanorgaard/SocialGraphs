We're fragile
(Wish I'da known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You are not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to
(We been here before)
I don't ever wanna change
I'm fragile
I don't ever (No)

Some of the people appointed to give an opinion never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and die
N9na be givin' the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible
Get fanned away with grands to pay, this jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne, I'ma look very mean when a foe
Scribe a line, but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto'
'Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real, I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads, sizzling your ad?
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this (Understand this)
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes, I'm

I don't ever wanna change

Tell me that I'm famous, tell me that my name is
Big as Venus, Jupiter, and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favorite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin', abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as a Uzi
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm 'bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved, you shoulda known my music
We're fragile
(Wish I'da known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile

151 Rum, Pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come, out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come

Half a bottle of 151 off in a jug
1 cup of Malibu Rum, baby that's whassup then you
Fill the rest of the jug with pineapple juice and it's crackin'
The only defect is waking up like what happened
I like red light parties and fed right bodies who like
Bread like Dolly and head right totties at night
Aribou Cay oulay
Terrible day you pay the liquor store teller
With no hair or toupee, touché
Get the party jumping, keep the hotties humpin'
I like 'em thick and juicy so don't Pilates nothin'
Drinkin' too much Lou you
Might be karate punchin' or at the back of the club
Attending the naughty luncheon

I'd like to give a big shout out to Caribou Lou
'Cause I drink it, but they ain't paying me for it
Not yet! 

Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one, so it's guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kan' City natives and we all a little coo-coo

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin' *Mwah*
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off
'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross three thick friends
We mixin' these licks when they big friend wanna lip off
So I told her kindly, "Get lost, bitch"
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit!!

Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock her up
I'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Tryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, "Don't mess around with them pitbulls"

Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'gnac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up!

This Kan' City, shit's ran gritty
In the summertime the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Everybody got they hands up like (Woah!)
See a bad bitch like (ohh!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the Mo!!
