I dunno what you've been told but G-Force is back in the building, building
And if so then you best know that we dish the word and feed em, feed em
Moving with caution ... we roll with kings and not with apes man
We still give praises, seek the Father's face, ask for peace and grace
Please believe, believe me please when I say Jesus Christ is all you need
To eliminate your miseries like paying off your tuition fees
Me and Christ go like cookies n cream, thеrefore makes us an unstoppablе team
And through His grace I'm fully redeemed and if life is music, this is the theme
V.2
God getting busy, Son getting busy, Holy Spirit indeed, Trinity come with me
Three kings in the premises, I don't think they understand the mission, it get's hard but I'm repping it
Hot-stepping it the best like Jesus, I can see the really red text when I read it
I deny the danger, yet I believe and confess I'm a man of favor and faith
Just seek His face, kingdom come first then reap the taste
You can find it easy-peazy like Sherlock, even vice-versa, preachy like huh
I'ma read the Wisdom Keys by Mike Murdock, ... like huh
Said you wanna know who dat is, Jesus, God with us, that's who that is
V.3
Check one, check two, I'm allowed in the room
If not, what you waiting for, squeeze to the front
You can jump, hop, skip to the beat, unique
We doing it, hop-scotch, move with your feet
It's no fear when I'm here
See the smile on my face, rep Christ when I'm here
He's alive, wave hands in the air
This holy ground, no shots in the air
So I may go wild, see me go crazy
Hot 16's for Jesus who saved me
Now in an Army, more like a Navy
Call of duty, spreading the good news daily
We came not to entertain
You can never find me in the box like David Blaine
Who's dat, G-Force, word on the street
It's either that, across the map, we came with the heatYou might also 

I bounce off the freeway, Ricochet in a chevy
Up in L.A., Hit your hood and park valet
Ain't nothing you can tell me, Or dream you can sell me
Tell me if you ready, Holla if ya hear me
Smarter than the average, Learn game from a savage
Never sell your soul for the fame or the cabbage
Men make the money, Money never make the men
I found money make men funny, To some it make 'em sin
I learned a lesson bout women
Hide your cheese if she mouselike
In other words, you can't turn a rat into a house wife
You can't lie to me, I know you got your P.I. degree
That's why I shake you haters like the ivory
5 plus 2 more reasons, I'm thinking alligator shoes
With the pedal on the cruise, In Lincoln navigators
I ain't mad you hate us, Cause we got papers
The dj's play us, Yellin ''Jesus saved us''
Rockin wit the majors, vacay in Vegas
Gone til november if you need us, you can page us
B-Rite paid us, Now millions awaits us
To get the crowd moving to a track meech made us

At ease, Freeze, Feel my vibe about to serve something phat
Holla, Hear me right, The media taken up, who they want to force to live like that
Making power moves
Lacing hot tracks for my zero's
While pubbin up my hero
I gizzown, Wizzown, Dizzown, 2 triple o
Stakes in the game heating up, I'm tweaking
God opened up the door, Ain't no need for sneaking
Worldwide, Name known, 2 G name owned
Everytime, On the road, Do a show, Love shown
Motivated by christ to give it all that we can
Around the world in a day cause we in demand
Do you love me? Riders never sleep
Would you sub me? Bouncing in your jeep
While the thugs be hanging on the streets
And the clubs be moving to my beats

Swingin' swazy, Life knock hard like Jay Z
When interscope want a bomb hit, They page me
You know what like, Orville Redenbacher, I keep it poppin baby
We bout to take you on a journey and you can't stop it baby
They say I'm crazy, Cuz I act like this
Tour the world, And got the dance floor packed like this
I wanna live life the rich and give to the poor
So, We can all have dough and educate to get mo'
Check those, Wreck those, That get out of pocket
While they melting like chocolate, We the ones makin profit
You can't change mine, My lyrics got hang time
Beat so tight If you could see it It'd be throwing up gang signs
Non-alcoholla, With faith to move a mountain
Young balla, Wit hundreds steady counting
Giving God praise, Come and drink, From his fountain
But turn it up and holla back, While you bouncing
 - 2X
Can you see what I see?
Can you feel what I feel?
Throw your hands in the air
