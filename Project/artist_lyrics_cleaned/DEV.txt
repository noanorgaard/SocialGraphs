Dancin' in the dark
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Dancin' in the dark

Can you work on me?
Open my body up and do some surgery
Now that you got me up, I wanna taste it, taste it
And see those pocket aces

Wanna see who you are
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
I got a sex drive, just push to start

Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Dancin' in the dark
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la

I love to flirt to see
I'm only talkin' to you if you wanna surf my seas
Now that you got me, boy
You know you better spice it, flavor it
Get, g-get it right, savor it

Wanna see who you are
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Got a sex drive, just push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
Push, push, push, push to start
I got a sex drive, just push to start
On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancin' in the dark
Tell me, baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night, I pretend we are
Dance, dan-da-dance, dancin' in the dark

(Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la)

Tell me, baby, if it's wrong (Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la)

To let my hands do what they want (Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la)

Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Dancin' in the dark
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la

It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots of Patron
Don't give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin', Robotussin

Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
