But then I see you and
I wanna go where the beach is warm
And I won't get stung
And I won't get stormed by
Memories of you

Baby, is this how you feel?
I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel?

In each of us, there are always these two
The one who stays, the one who's leaving you
I could keep on with the same mistakes
Or I could make 'em with you

There's some lead in my feet now
There's a little of me but I don't know where
I'm too young to quit now
I'm too young to quit but I gotta get clean
Is it real for you like it's real for me?
I've been walking in suburbia
Just looking for you
You might also like
Baby, is this how you feel?
I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel?

And I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna

I move up, it's called awake
And then down to the heavy nights
But never forward

Baby, is this how you feel?
I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel?
I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel?
I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel?

I wanna know, wanna know
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel, baby?
Is this how you feel?
Is this how you feel,
