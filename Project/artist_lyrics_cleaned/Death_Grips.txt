Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't

Drop it like-
Oh yeah, that's so trashy
How low can you go?
How dirty can you get? Nasty, fucker
Drug through the dirt
Razor cut that eight millimeter make it hurt
Chain sleaze leather face
Fucker please, you must be smokin' rocks
Whip it
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
Hit it, fuck it, feel it, whip it, burn it, turn it out and kick it to da curb
Shut it down
Forged in the flames, said it before and I'll say it again
Quazar game maximum vacuum rotation spin s-s-s

When shit goes down I'll be there
With my hand on my gun, and my eyes on the road
Ghost ridin' to hell, fuck if I care
Who wanna catch my droze?
Give a fuck, blood, I ain't goin' nowhere
Templar night and day, live an die by the code
Code of the street, how to stay in the zone
How I own it and freak it to the base of the bone
I am the darkness creeping through your system
The lash of da whip cracking every bitch into position
Workin' you over crashing and burning in a blackhole blasting out
Your subwoofers are melting
Hear a bitch say, "Why's he yelling?"

Who wanna catch dis gun clap?
Shrapnel off me lip cause blood bath
Bitch please, you must be smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't (Who wanna catch)
Fucker please, you must be smokin rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't (Who wanna catch)

Cause I run this lik
Like dogtown ripped
That raw shit like none other
Low down dirty shit
Shot off this hip
Death Grips, mothafucka

Please, you must be
Smokin' rocks
Real shit for my people
And it just don't stop

Bitch, 

Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes are pulling, are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull- are pull-
Greed tastes like sin
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Massive

Peel out, press me to magnetic slab
Severe swerving, I tow lag
Off uncertainty 'til your zipper locks
My salvia silhouette commence shots
Sixty shots a second on a hexed clock
I strike 'tween each time your solar plex drops
(Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes)
I'm skidding out
I can't help yourself, I skid in doubt
I've dealt with yourself, I tricked hell out
I'm all helter-skelter, I'm on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it's fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can't be the road
I'm crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don't blame me, I've no soul

My skids 'til the brink, I jizz snowmen
Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids writ rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I'm no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can't establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice (Spikes, spikes, spikes)
Cumulus in both hands, can't kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I'm too passcode, these gates won't stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I'm finally astral now, grab my stems

I'm cloaked trash
Poker fucking polygraphs

This side of my machete
Fall out mercury confetti
Ebony skies, I died already
Liquor store counting pennies
I'm in motion, do you savvy?
I exhume ‘cause it relax me
Watch you think ‘bout that? Don't fight it
Smell me though, fucker quiet
Cyclone in a gortex shell
Audio input for my spell
Show up for what? This cig's too plush
Long as my smokescreen's holding up
I hold this down like high contrast
Stills taken from shade on flash
I'm so shade tree it makes me laugh
Every time you reply "that's fine"

Three bedrooms in a good neighborhood
On fire like a margarita made out of wood
She got solar panels for thirty cents a watt
In the future, there's a party from the past, she's a cop

I'll jail break ADX with a blank tarot card
Same card pull your hoe card like Zoltar
Two crystal balls dangle from my boneyard
I'm Niagara falls flowing crowbars
La la la la, I got folsom bars
Your flows urinal take a dive bars
La la la la
Go down in the fifth you service town car
Swiftly service me, bitch, it's called outlaw
