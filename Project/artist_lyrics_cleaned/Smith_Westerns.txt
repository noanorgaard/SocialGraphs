Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too

Head-on stars aligned
All the dreams are on my side
Na na na na na, a girl like you
Took her fall, so I felt down
Never wanna see anything
Na na na na na, a girl like you
You might also like
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here too
Weekends are never fun
Unless you're around here
