Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di
Da-ba-dee, da-ba-di, da-ba-dee, da-ba-di

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

Blue his house with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette and everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (To listen)
