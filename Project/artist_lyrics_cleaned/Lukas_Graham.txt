I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
'Cause I know there's more

I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)

I don't have any answers
The more I know, the more I grow (Grow)
I don't know where I'm going
But I'ma search 'cause I see hope (Hope)

There's got to be more than this
Gotta figure out how to jump the wall
I wanna live and learn
Don't matter if I land or if I fall
I know I might return
At least I know I'll be walking tall
I'm not afraid

'Cause I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old

Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own

You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Isn't fair
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me

Though I know that you're not there
I still write you all these songs
It's like, you got the right to know what's going on
As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound
At times I still think I can spot you in the crowd

Time can heal your wounds if
You're strong and standing tall
I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all
They say, "You'll grow older, and it'll get better still"
Yes, I will, but no, it won't
They don't get it, 'cause

You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Isn't fair

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothin' to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buyin' clothes
Folks were passin' on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointin' nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t have it bad
I got enough lovin' from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted a deal in Hollywood
I told them I'd be singin' on TV
The other kids were callin' me a wannabe
The older kids, they started buggin' me
But now they're all standin' right in front of me

My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright

I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and strugglin'
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I always keep 'em tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?
My mama said that it was okay

Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Ooh ooh ooh
All of my friends are in the room
Ooh ooh ooh
Party for me, I'd party too

You're all on my tab
Bartenders pour out the whiskeys on me
And don't be so sad
'Cause I lived this good
We were closer
Now it's over
But it doesn't mean it's closure
I see you and I love you
I'll be watching out above you

Magazines are writing stuff but I don't ever read them
Some of the folks I used to know would see and start believing
That I would pass them by on streets and never reach to greet them
I still remember folks even though I rarely meet them
Don't you know I miss the times when we used to hang?
Before twenty deep depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single blow
Before all our careers depended on a single show
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home
Now I got a lot of cash and I'm on the road
I realize privacy's becoming difficult
It's alright now, but what about when I'm old?
I know my good friends, now they'll last
The same ones that stood by me when my daddy passed
All I know is that we'll never really be alone
'Cause we got a lot of love and a happy home

I write a lot of songs, will anybody ever read them?
You hear them on the radio, but will you really read them?
Why do we have our idols and why do we wanna be them?
After we see them on TV we really wanna meet them

Before a fan base depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single show
Who's gonna stand, who's gonna fall, I really wanna know
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home
My daddy used to play me vinyl but now daddy's gone
I used to practice with my mommy on the piano
I still get nervous every time I know she's at a show
Now my family comes first before everyone
I had the perfect dad, I wanna be the perfect son
Though I really feel sometimes I am on my own
I know I got a lot of love and a happy
