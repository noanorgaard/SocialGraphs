This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference 'tween me and Hova

But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, 

(W-W-W-What is it?)

Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh

Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it
You better change what comes out your speaker
You better change, ch-change, ch-change, ch-change
You better change what comes out your speaker
Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?

Your SL's missin' an S, nigga (Y'all feel like danc—)
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see, they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound (Yeah)
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come, a hundred goin' overboard (Yeah)
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow-for-blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw (Y'all feel like danc—)
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gym stars, I'm like D. Rose

Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day— God!
