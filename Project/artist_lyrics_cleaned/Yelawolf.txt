Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who's gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican
Oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you 

Hold up, damn rich, peanut butter guts in the Lamborghini, woah
You must have white bread, let's make a sandwich (Yeah)
No I ain't never seen money like you got (No)
Nobody got that kind of money in the boondocks (No)
So if you take me up and show me the balcony lookin' over
The Hollywood Valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
But with me you'll appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle (Yeah)
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo? (Rap)
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo

Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partyin' with Kim
Entertainment Channel

You're young and reckless (Yeah), nice little diamond and necklace (yeah)
Gotta pint-sized vodka drink and you're pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast?
But you ain't never been to Waffle House (No)
Always hangin' in Guys and Dolls (Yeah)
If you came to the South, I'd put you in the Chevrolet
And we'd slide to the mall (C'mon)
Yeah, I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and a DTA hoody
But I'm walkin' through the party with Rogue Status lookin' for Beverly Hill goodies (Well)
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I'll take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy

To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action

What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me (Yeah) wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the (Yeah) party goin' in the 808 blowin' 'cause Drama (Yeah) made a beat that'll climb the chart up
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a honey in a Lamborghini will do (Yeah)
Some will run into a hundred-dollar bill
And drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with a 24-inch shoe
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's Slick Rick E. Bobby, baby
Gotta let me drive that thing, come on

Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised
808 drums quaking, they shake that box, '88
And the dope boys hotter than hells gate
But I, still in the shade
With a fold out chair, with a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A, B-A-M-A
I’m off I might be in the lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case
Yeah I’m bringing the case
I’m getting throwed off

Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

And I’m all the way throwed off
Z71 take the bow off
Dipped in Mossy Oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat
Yeah buddy, might go off
Split you like a bowling ball
Spit chew in my overalls
Yeah home of the gumbo
Got a couple folks that’d do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That Dixie Cup's gonna fall off the console
You don’t wanna have a convo with not understand that Bama slanguage
Like hollering ain't it
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be throwed off
Chorus: 
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll

I’m just a Kid that Rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits
Than a fucking jackhammer, dog
'Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
