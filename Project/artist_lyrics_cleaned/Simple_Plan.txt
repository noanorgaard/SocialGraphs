When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go

And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

What the hell is wrong with me? Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake, I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
Yeah, I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)
And I'm just a kid (I'm just a kid)

I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is—
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and all life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is—
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight
I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid 

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm alright
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore

I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all

I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)
Please don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
But you don't understand (You don't understand)

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
