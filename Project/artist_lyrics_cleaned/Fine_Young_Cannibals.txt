She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me, there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
You might also like

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help
