If I don't leave this room soon
All my bones will break in two
Think what I should, think what I should
Have till today to have it come out good

American, American
This dream's all I got to keep me going, keep me going
Keep me going, keep me going

If I ever end up where I aim
Part of me knows it will be the same
Climbing mountains, climbing mountains
It taught me that I don't like to win
