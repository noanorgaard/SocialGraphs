Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I could be your confidante
Just one of your girlfriends
But I (I) know that's (Know that's) not what you want
If tomorrow the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me, who have you been dreaming of?
I and I alone
Oh no, oh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling
This moment is critical
It might be revealing
We could get physical
Oh no
No, no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty (Ah-ah)
Be the devil and angel too (Ah-ah)
Got a heart and soul and body (Ah-ah)
Let's see what this love can do
(Ah-ah) Let's see what love can do, oh (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Maybe I'm perfect for you, maybe I'm perfect for you)
(Ah-ah) You, maybe I'm perfect for you (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Even though the gods are crazy (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Even though the stars are blind  (Ah-ah)
Even though the gods are crazy (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Even though the stars are blind (
