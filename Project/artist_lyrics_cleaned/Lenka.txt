But it's gonna be blue skies, for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies, for you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
And the clouds roll by

And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by

I can feel it, it's a comet
Fast and fierce and wild
I can see it
Every time I look into those eyes
Tell me, is it really gonna storm again?
Will the sky turn dark? Will the rain begin?
I wanna be with you wherever lightning strikes
'Cause I know

That it's gonna be blue skies, for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies, for you and I

Blue, blue, blue and clear and bright
Blue, blue, clear and blue and bright
Blue, blue—
And the clouds roll by

And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by

Blue, blue, blue and clear and bright
Blue, blue, clear and blue and bright
Blue, blue, blue, blue

Slow it down, make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot
To be something I'm not
I'm a fool out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone, I've tried
And I don't know why
I am just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down, I know
I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spotlight
The people follow the sign
And synchronize in time
It's a joke nobody knows
They've got a ticket to that show

Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone, I've tried
And I don't know why
I am just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
