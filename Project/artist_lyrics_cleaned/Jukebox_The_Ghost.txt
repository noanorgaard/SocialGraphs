Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking

And we always say the same old things
And we always use the same tired lines
Staying up all night, talking it out
Ending up with no one on our side
And as time goes on and on
I can feel my heart growing colder and colder
But then I see your face in the crowd, I think
"How can it be, starting over?"

Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
Girl, you're gonna take me
Back to a time when I loved and I meant it
Girl, you're gonna save me
Give me a chance, it's worth taking
It's worth taking
Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart, open your mind

Give me a chance, it's worth taking

Wh-wh-wh, wh-wh-wh, wh-wh-wh, wh-when
Wh-wh-wh, wh-wh-wh, wh-wh-wh, wh-when

Just sneaking somewhere is a song upon which we rely
To keep our arms and bodies precariously entwined and
As I move to the spot where you had just been
My mind and body turn and we begin again

A-na-na, a-na-na, a-na-na, again
A-na-na, a-na-na, a-na-na, again
Again
Oh, babe, well

'Cause even you can find a shoulder to lean upon
Some other bastard social soldier without uniform and
He will look you in the eyes and you would feel at home
And then the moment had passed and you were once again

A-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la, alone
A-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la, alone
A-la-la, a-la-la, a-la-la, alone
A-la-la, A-la-la, A-la-la-la-la-la-la-lone
Alone
Oh, babe, well

You will find me in a stance in empty arms
Shaking my head and sneaking glances for you in the crowd
At the passerbys
Shaking my head like we used to do in better times

T-t-tuh, t-t-tuh, t-t-better times
T-t-tuh, t-t-tuh, t-t-better
