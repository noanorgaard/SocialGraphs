If you want to, I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside, so busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

I'm sinking slowly
So hurry, hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

If you want to, I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside, so busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares
You might also like
All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me, you know I'll be there
Oh-oh, whoa, yeah

If you want to, I can save you
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside, so busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares
Oh, whoa
(And all you wanted was somebody who cares)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want to (If you want to), I can save you (Oh)
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside, so busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're 

Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Oh, whoa, oh

When I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath, it's you I breathe
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see 

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closin' my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
Oh, whoa
You might also like
And it hurts to want everything
And nothin' at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you
But I'm not givin' in this time

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
Goodbye to you (Goodbye to you)
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew (Goodbye to you)
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
(The one thing that I tried to hold on to)
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
(The one thing that I tried to hold on to)

Oh, whoa
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
And when the stars fall, I will lie awake
You're my shooting
