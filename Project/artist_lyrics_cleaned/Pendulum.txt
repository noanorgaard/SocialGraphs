What are you waiting for?
Just surrender here tonight
What are you waiting for
As we go towards the light?

When everything is said and done
Still looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back, the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone


I am caught in your slow release
Seems like your traveler is eager to move me
My reflection will slowly fade
To another time until my head escapes

Still looking for answers, if only one
Turn my back, the urge has gone
Left with no reason, we come undone


Woah-oh-oh woah
Woah-oh-oh
