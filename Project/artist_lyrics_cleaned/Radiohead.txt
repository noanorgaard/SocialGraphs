Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises

Silent
Silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

Sing the song on the jukebox that goes

Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
