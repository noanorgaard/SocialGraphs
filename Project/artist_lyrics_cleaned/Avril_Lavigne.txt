It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Oh oh oh
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?

With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
