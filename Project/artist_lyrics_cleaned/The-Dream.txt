You said you'll be
Right here forever baby
I know someday
There's no forever baby
I'm just looking for a little favour
And you're just trying to save a little time
Baby let me give you a peace of mind

That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue

Take whatever's left, baby
If you go without your heart you will never know
You, me
As we walk into those doors
In the shadows of the unknown
You might also like
I think of you daily
Loving everything about you
And I hope that you
You love everything about me too
But don't you leave like that
Don't leave right here, oh no
Stay with me just a couple minutes more

That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you, code blue
That's what I get for loving you
(That's what I get for loving you) code blue
That's what I get for loving you
(All I do, all I do) code blue
That's what I give for loving you, code blue

That's what I get for love
That's what I get for love
That's what I get from

She don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all on my phone right now like that's my dick
Nigga she don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all in the club reppin' like she my bitch
Nigga that's my shit, you can't stand it but that's my shit
Don't need to be dramatic but that's my shit
Let a nigga try to come behind me
She met you while tryna find me
Try to never mind me
Ain't gotta remind me boy that's my shit

You tryna make her wyle out, I just make 'em wyle out
I put that pussy in the rain, you put that pussy in a drought
I make her wanna stay, you just make her wanna leave
She want me to put a ring on it, with you she don't wanna be seen
We've been places that you'll never, ever, ever go
I know shit about her that you'll never, ever, ever know

You the type to act "why you ain't call me or nothin'?"
And I wouldn't have that bitch in the mall with me for nothin'
You keep petty conversation
We know two words, orgasm and penetration
Big dawg, ball to the wall, goin' all in
Send her ass back to ya, hope you fall in
Kick it with her ratchet friend, you took all ten of 'em
With ya to the club and got 'em all in, scrub
Bet anything that you would give one day
To know the life a real nigga live one day
Know what it like when niggas fuck with you for real for running yay

Shawty is the sh-sh-sh-sh
Sugar honey iced tea
Prettiest one I see
Little mama icy
They say she a Pisces
I heard they are feisty
You know how to treat her, she'll be sweeter than a Hi-C
Clean up very nicely, shoes are kinda pricey
Match 'em up precisely, good jean, nice tee
Like her food spicy
And she is the same
Hotter than a flame, but I do not know her name
Is it Keisha?
Is it Tisha?
Maybe Lisa?
Or Teresa?
It could be Tia
Maybe Aaliyah
I guess I'll find out one day
For now I'ma say (Ayy)
