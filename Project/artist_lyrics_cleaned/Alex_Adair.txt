Don't know where you've been my baby
But heaven must have sent you
Heaven must have sent you

Heaven must have sent you

So long I've needed love right near me
Have some voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Heaven must have sent you
So long I've needed love right near me
Have some voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Heaven must have sent you

Oh baby

Love you more each day
It's a heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I want to stay
Hey yeah
Oh
