We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over

Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you singing

Hey mama, don't stress your mind, we ain't coming home tonight
Hey ma, we gonna be alright, dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind

Mama, mama, mama, hey
We ain't coming home tonight
Mama, mama, mama, hey
We ain't coming home tonight

Alright, 'cause we got the keys to the universe

Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

Up all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No, not tonight
Keep me by your side

Keep me by your side
Keep me by your

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
