I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you


I don't know what it is, but I got that feelin'
Wakin' up in this bed next to you, swear the room, yeah, it got no ceilin'
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talkin'
I might have to tell you somethin' (Damn)

Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay here with me
Lay here with me, ayy, ayy, ooh

I like me better when I'm with you (Yes, I do, yes, I do, baby)
I like me better when I'm with you (Oh no)

I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

Keep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I got a habit, it's bad
Oh no, I'm not even mad

It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm sayin' one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours
It's the way you know I'm yours for life

'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
