Now it's summer time in the sun, sun, sun
One thing on my mind, gon', gon', gon', gon'
When the children play it's fun, fun, fun
But I must go, must run, run, run
Ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh
Owhhh
Aohh

We run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
We run, we run, we run, we run, run, run
We run, we run, we run
Run, run, run and run and run
Now I go to bed and cry, cry, cry
I pay the price I die, die, die

Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run

Life was easy when I was young, young, young
Life was easy when I was young, young, young
Life was easy when I was young, young,
