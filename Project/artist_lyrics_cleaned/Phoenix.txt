They teach you suffer to resist
Too much intention, Presbyterian
Mint julep testosterone
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Is innocent too immature where you’re from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all

Two dozen pink and white ranunculus
Why? What are the problems to solve?
To part-time holy bachelors
Tell them that you want me
Tell them that you want me

It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on

Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Compliments sound too cynical where you're from
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what they want is

Gruesome
I don't care where you're from
Nothing's that personal
There is no physical evidence of cannibal boyfriends

Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all
Why don't you tell me that you want me?
Tell me that you want it 

Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From a mess to the masses

Disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, 

It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it all the summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
It's not a miracle we needed
And no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present, 1855-1901
Watch them build up a material tower
Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

My love, my love, my love, my love is
My love, my love, my love is
My love, my love, my love, my love is
Cruel

Buckle up, we'll chase each other
It's not a lot, it's just enough to matter
Any way you want the truth is
I will marry you on Tuesdays
I don't always tell the truth
If you want it you can lose, don't bother
I don't like it if you miss me
Why would I long for you?

Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention when I asked for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be loved, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked, I'm gonna let you go
It's the Picasso, Michelangelo
Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny, shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
Suddenly you're out of the woods
Inside of an alley, you're out of words
Well, I thought it was radium at first

Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two

Something that don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth, we're all to blame their lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll
Something about how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed and then laughed and you lived to the laugh?
Turn me on the lonely on the side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever

Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two

Just because of you
