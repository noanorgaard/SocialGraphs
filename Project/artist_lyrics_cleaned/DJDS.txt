Deep in your arms (Deep in your arms)
Where I belong (Where I belong)
I'm safe from harm (I'm safe from harm)
Keep holding on

Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
You might also like
You got the world underneath your sleeve
And I got a heart that skips offbeat​
Love might be harder than it used to be
But you keep, keep holding on

Deep in your arms (Deep in your arms)
Where I belong (Where I belong)
I'm safe from harm (I'm safe from harm)
Keep holding on

Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on

Keep holding on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on (why don't you come on)
Why don't you come on
Keep holding on

Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
Why don't you come on
