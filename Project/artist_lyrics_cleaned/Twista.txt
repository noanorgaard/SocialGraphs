Now, now, now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, mack daddy with a ho up in the backseat
With a '97 pimp flow, got a feelin
When you smokin when I flip it to a Trax beat
Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter yo' atmosphere
As you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I can't believe that yo' momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul, you need a modelin' role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin'
From the bottom to the top of the pole, cause you can pop in control
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin' it
It's makin me say "What I gotta do to get with that?"
When it come to makin it rain I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin' that monkey I can get it wet
You want some media baby you need a better man
He cover politics, I'ma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'mma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin 5000 Ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration, you the champion, here's the fetti confetti
C'mon and get drunk with the money hauler
See Twista LiveGet tickets as low as $90You might also like
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good, but you can do better

You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me

But when I'm not for the feminine (feminine)
And everybody that proceed with the hatred I'ma teach 'em a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline (adrenaline)
Cause that's the way I receive immunization against the recession
I got the muscle off of my hustle-and-flow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo' money
So don't be trippin' whenever you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a lil' bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways
Then I'ma have to beat it up but first I'ma play wit'chu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin' and fakin' on me baby
Cause I know it take the right touch
I ain't stoppin' 'til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin 'til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion (Ohh)
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin'
Now when I touch your body you catchin' convulsions (uh-huh)
That's when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down on me

I'm calling you daddy, daddy

Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on

You know what I told her?

I told her to drive over in yo' new whip, bring some friends you cool with
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See, you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man, I swear, she fine homes, why she always lyin', though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo' pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition

Now, Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby, I can't do it that fast
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan Man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all is (Well, well, well, well)
Come wit' me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well, well, well, well)
Wit' my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit' Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world, girl, come on, go wit' me
I touch you all over your body, baby, don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on, I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride
