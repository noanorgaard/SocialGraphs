Long ago, just like the Hearse you die to get in again (One more time)
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst to take (Worst to take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long, and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So love your good night

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on, we'll carry on

So many bright lights to cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Can you see? My eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here on the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror
And I'm so weak

I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid

Wait until it fades to black, ride into the sunset
Would I lie to you? Well, I’ve got something to say
Grab your six-gun from your back, throttle the ignition
Would I die for you? Well, here's your answer in spades
Shotgun sinners, wild-eyed jokers, got you in my sights
Gun it while I’m holding on

After all is said and done, climb out from the pine box
Well, I’m asking you, 'cause she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue, call her black Mariah
Would I lie to you? That girl's not right in the brain
Mass convulsions strike the choir by the grace of God
Gun it while I’m holding on

But don't stop if I fall, and don't look back
Oh, baby, don't stop, bury me, and fade to black

She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door (Whoa!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Yeah!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Let's go!)

You'll never make me leave

Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts
And make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will

Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one
And one, and one, and one

Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those

Only go so far till you bury them
So deep and down, we go

Touched by angels, though
I fall out of grace
I did it all, so maybe
I'd live this every day
