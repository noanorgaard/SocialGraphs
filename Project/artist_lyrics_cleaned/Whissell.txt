Can't say I didn't warn you
Boy, you shouldn't get involved
Run while you have the chance to
Honey, ‘cause you don't know me at all

Don't love me, I'm quicksand
Won't freeze, I'm sinking
I'll pull you down if you try, try, try
You're in danger, no lie, lie, lie
Don't love me, I'm quicksand
You'll be gone in the morning
You think you'll stay but you won't, won't, won't
Call me, baby, oh no, no, no
Don't love me, I'm quicksand

But no I don't see your white flag, I don't see no white flag
When you gonna learn, gonna learn
This is something that you can't have but you want it so bad

You know that you're not gonna save me
This is who I am right now
You're screaming, "Will someone come save me"
As I'm taking you down
Taking you down, down, down
Taking you down, down, down
Baby, taking you down, down, down
You can't save me
Don't love me, I'm quicksand
Won't freeze, I'm sinking
