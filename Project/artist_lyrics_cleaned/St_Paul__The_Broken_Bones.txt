You got your limit, baby I got mine
611-3369
You got to call me, baby

We ain’t the lovers that’ll tear it down
We ain’t the fortune all over town

You got your limit, baby I got mine
611-3369
You got to call me, baby
I need you to pick up that telephone
And dial this lover’s heartache
Hey-hey, I need you to call me
I need to hear your sweet voice
Let me, let me, let me, let me hear you again

I need you
I need you
