In a dusty room, I come to assume
That I’ve been doomed to lose my mind tonight
Too weak to fight
So I try to save face then I rest my case
The judge pulls me aside, says, “C’est la vie
Let your darker side come out to feed”

“All rise...
I can't do sexy”


I commit the crime of wastin' time
Always tryna rhyme
Yes, I am guilty
But don’t misunderstand me
I admit defeat then I move my feet
My history will never be repeated
I won’t ever be repeated

I'll be your transportation
We'll find there's a kind of place
That can only be seen with a naked mind

I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine

We can't wait one minute more

There's a key that opens a door
(Will you find it and turn it?)
Take your time, don't take too long

Two stars, one constellation
Bright lights just to guide the way
Can you see what I see in you?

I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
