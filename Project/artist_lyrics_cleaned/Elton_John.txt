Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did

Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down, I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today


Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world

I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

This is the song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
