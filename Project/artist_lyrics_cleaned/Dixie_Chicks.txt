Hey, babe, I know in time

You're gonna see what you mean to me

Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

Could've been true love, but it wasn't

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger

Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing

But time makes you bolder
