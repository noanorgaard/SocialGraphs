I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
'Bout to tie one on
Talkin' gone, gone, gone
Turnin' all the wrongs into right

Workin' on the sweet thing sittin' on a bar stool
Doin' shots of Jack, girl, gonna take it old school
Singin', "Hell yeah," to every song they're playing
Do ya wanna dance? Baby, I'm just sayin'

There ain't too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing

Today the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin' on me

Lady love, forgets me every time
I'm spending my days packin' nickels and dimes
But the man in the moon, yeah he's alright
He must've flipped on the switch when he left last night
'Cause I'm feelin' alright, feelin' alright

Today the sun is shinin' on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ain't sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shinin' on me

For a guy like me, guess he sees who needs saving
Every night I hit my knees again, thanking the Lord she's a lot like him
She loves me with a grace that's truly amazing

Yeah, God made a woman fall for a man
Didn't have much going, but his life began when she took his hand
