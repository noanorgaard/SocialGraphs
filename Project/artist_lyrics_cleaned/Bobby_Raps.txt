I'm so high and nobody cares
I walk past and nobody stares
Guess it's not that easy to recognize
I try not to judge, I won't testify
Let go of them people who haunt me
I was holed up in the spot, I was holding
I got them lingering feelings, still haunting
I see my brothers get fold up like laundry
So I just roll one up and face it, face it
I see my demons and I face it, I face it
She can't get with it, she can't face it, can't face it
Hard to admit it, you can't face it, can't face it
Still stuck in denial
I see the pain in the smile
All these memories
I can't hide from

Now it's like a
Grand old tale, left me traumatized
I couldn't shake it off, no matter how hard I tried
Hiding from myself but these mirrors won't lie
Watching me die, tryna feel alive
We will find where love will become whole, woah
We will find where love will become whole, woah

Now I'm plagued by this paranoia
Thought it would change out in California
Until I realized it's all the same
No escape, not when the feelin' of doin' will turn 'em away
I got to buy, put the burner away
I'm gonna learn from mistakes
Fuck around, I stay up 'til seven thirty or eight
Knowing these demons determine my fate and eternal inferno awaits
Fuck what a journalist say, I piss on 'em like urinal cakes
Told my baby meet me at the terminal gate
And I'm feelin' observant today, in the streets I'm a servant today
I'm serve 'em a plate
Workable play but I heard he a snake
Might get my hands dirty today
Dirty money on the table, I stay out the game if I'm able
But still I'm gon' dabble, I dance with the devil
The road that's least travelled and gravelled
But still I unravel my life like a novel
I got rental car nostalgia, uh
Work like nothing's been accomplished, uh
Stick your pencils in the pouches, uh
Catch me sleeping on these couches

Like a grand old tale, left me traumatized
I couldn't shake it off, no matter how hard I tried
Hiding from myself but these mirrors won't lie
Watching me die, tryna feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, tryna feel alive
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive, tryna feel alive
We will find where love will become one, woah
No plan escape
Falling rain
When planets line
You can't decide
Decide, decide
No plan escape
Falling rain
When planets line
You can't decide
Decide when it's time
No plan escape
Falling rain
When planets line
You can't decide
Decide which time
No plan escape
Falling rain
When planets line
You can't decide
Decide which
