Said I got your, (got your), picture, (picture), on a frame across the wall, (wall)
And I stuck it out, (stuck it out), with ya, (with ya), cause you said that we wouldn't fall, f-fall, f-fall
You've proved your point, (point) Okay I get it, (get it)
That this is just a ride and you ain't try to sweat it, no
And yes I'll try, (try), try to forget it, (get it)
But you cut me so deep, cut, cut, cut, cut me so deep
Che'Nelle (Chorus):
A stranger You've become a stranger
A stranger You've become a stranger You cut me so deep, cut, cut, cut, cut me so deep
You cut me so deep, cut, cut, cut, cut me so deep
You cut me so deep, cut, cut, cut, cut me so deep
Che'Nеlle (Verse):
See I try to, (try to), fix ya, (fix ya), but thе damage is beyond repair
I couldn't see it, (see it), didn't want to, (want to)
Never thought you wouldn't want me there, the-there, the-there
You've proved your point, (point) Okay I get it, (get it)
That this is just a ride and you ain't try to sweat it, no
And yes I'll try, (try), try to forget it, (get it)
But you cut me so deep, cut, cut, cut, cut me so deep

Colby O'Donis (Verse):
Everywhere I go, (go) Everything I see, (see)
Girl it reminds me of you and me
How I miss you so much, miss your touch
Just only wish you could fall back in love?
But I see that you're hurt, (hurt)Seein you cry, (cry)
Breaks my bitty heart, breaks my bitty heart
Cannot deny, (ny), ain't gonna lie, (lie)
Breaks my bitty heart, breaks my bitty heart, (heart)
Now try to understand cause you got every man showin him the things that I used to do?
Not cool, not cool, not cool
How would you like it if I did it to you?
And how girls say I've become a stranger
But really when you put our love on the hanger
I became a stranger
