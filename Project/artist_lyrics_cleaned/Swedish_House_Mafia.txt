That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See, Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See, Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

There was a time I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs remindin' me of a friend
