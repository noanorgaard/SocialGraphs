Peaches come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
And if I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches

I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or a can or a pie

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free, look out!

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free

Millions of peaches, peaches for free, look 

Some postman
Is grooving

It's noon now
And all the mailboxes have been emptied
And all the letters are inside
He counts them
He checks them
He looks for clues and finds
The ones with hearts on the outside

Holding onto a package
Meant for a distant lover
Thought it would be there overnight
She waits and
She cries and
She thinks he does not love her
The postman holds on oh-so tight

You (you) crushed (crushed) paper hearts
Stole (stole) and sold (sold) and ripped apart
You promise with stamps
But you never deliver to me
Some postman you turned out to
