And ever since I left my mother
It's much harder to know
How to make my own life here
How to make my own home

I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind

I remember a time when a kiss on the hand was enough
'Cause we knew we were free and we knew what it meant to be loved

But ever since I left my father
It's much harder to know
How to live my own life here
When all I need is home

I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind

As faces start to fade
They're slipping through my hands
It's where my heart was made
And my feet will always land

I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
I don't wanna wake up lonely
I don't wanna just be fine
I don't wanna keep on hoping
Forget what I have in mind
Forget what I have in mind
I don't wanna wake up 

And I hate that I can't say your name
Without feeling like I'm part of the blame
And it's never gonna feel quite the same
But it's never gonna change
And I hate that I'm always so young
Had me feeling like you were the one
And it's never gonna feel like it's done
'Cause it's never gonna change
Never gonna change
Never gonna change
Never gonna change

While I dance here softly
You're next to me again (Next to me again)
But we're still tugging on each other
And tearing at the fraying loose ends

Gave you a minute
When you needed an hour
Just to push it aside
Instead of leaving it behind you
If any word that I said
Could have made you forget
I'd have given you them all
But it was all in your head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again
And we're burning all the bridges now
'Cause it was sink or swim and I went
Down, down, down

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

If I didn't hide it
Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it
Guess I made it too easy
If any word that you said
Could have made me forget
Would I get up off the floor?
'Cause this is all in my head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

Can we forget about it?
Can we forget
Can we forget about it?
Can we forget?
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges 

Tell me you care
Tell me you care

If I lose my way and forget what I need
Just remind me now of what you give to me
If you hold my hand and take me where you go
I'll show you the side that no one knows

I'm taking you there
I'm taking you there

If scars are for the living, then I could be forgiven
(You're the light, you're the light to guide me)
And everything you need, I could give you
If scars are for the living, then I could be forgiven
(You're the light, you're the light to guide me)
And everything you have, I take too
