I will take the passenger seat
Baby, we don't have to go far
Unless you wanna show
Me a lovely place out of town
Where you feel most at ease
Well, you are the one that I like
Always will be
It's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
One single touch from you, I'm gone
Still got the rush when I'm alone
I think it is time I let you know
Take all of me, I will devote
You set me free, my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved
I want you to take over control
Take over control, ta-ta-take, take over control
Oh, oh, oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on
I want you to take over control
Take over control, ta-ta-take, take over control
Oh, oh, oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on

Baby, baby, can't you see?
That I'm givin' all of me
So, it's up to you now
We could let time pass away
I'll make an excuse to play
But it's up to you now
Just wanna fulfill your needs
While you're takin' over me
So, what do you want now?
Take a picture, make a show
'Cause nobody has to know
All the ways that we get down
I want you to take over control
Take over control, ta-ta-take, take over control

And now we're standin' on the edge
Lookin' like, "Here we go again"
I used to be your man
But today, I woke up as your friend

As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend

Oh, lil' ma-mama, I can feel your fire
You're poisonous, lady, let me take you higher
And I don't care if this a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight

I'm trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars, and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh, I'm ten feet tall

I'll be careful, so don't be afraid
You're safe here, no these arms won't let you break
I put up a sign in the clouds
So they all know that we ain't ever coming down

I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever think if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright....

Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

They say if you look around for something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down but Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright....

Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight


Hope I feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the end much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well, well maybe tonight
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are

I won’t break down tonight

Oh, I won’t break down tonight
I feel it for the first time, I feel it for the first time

And every night she walks the streets
With a little red dress looking for some love
She's out of luck
But if you ask her, "What you're smiling for?"
She'll say, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
"I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow"

He said, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."

Oh grey and old, she realized
Everything she loved, even gold, expires
All she got is a soul
But if I asked her, "What you're smiling for?"
She'll say, "I'm on this road, tryna catch tomorrow."
