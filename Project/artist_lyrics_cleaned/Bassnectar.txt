1 ContributorHexes Lyrics
You surprised me with a kiss
Underneath the crashing waves
You advised me with your tears
Then release your hexes

Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring

You invite me into your face
In between the acid rains
Hypnotize me with your kiss
Then release your hexes

Right back where you began
Torn apart from the inside
Race back into your skin
By the crawl you bring

By the crawl
By the crawl
By the crawl
By the crawl

'Cause it's easy to feel weighed down
And its easy to blame ourselves
When the sky is filled up with clouds
Raining down, yeah

'Cause it's you and me against the world now
And we're alright
And it's you and me against the world now
And we're alright
'Cause it's you and me against the world
Oh, it's you and me against the world
Oh, it's you and me, it's you and me, it's you and me
Against the world

Oh it's you and me against the world now
And it's you and me against the world
And it's you and me against the world
Oh it's you and me against the world now

Waiting now
On the side of nowhere
Spinnin' tires
Worn and tired
Reading maps
Lead us somewhere
We didn't plan
But here we stand

And it's easy to feel weighed down
And its easy to blame ourselves
When the sky is filled up with clouds
Raining down, yeah

'Cause it's you and me against the world now
And we're alright
And it's you and me against the world now
And we're alright
'Cause it's you and me against the world
Oh, it's you and me against the world
Oh, it's you and me against the world now
