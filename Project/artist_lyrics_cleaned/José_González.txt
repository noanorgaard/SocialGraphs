Sometimes there's things a man cannot know
The gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
Engine won't turn and the train won't leave
Engines won't turn and the train won't leave

I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
In the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Well, the way I feel is the way I write
Nothing like the thoughts of the man who lies
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise
You might also like
And I will wait for you tonight
You're here forever and you're by my side
I've been waiting all my life
To feel your heart as it's keeping time
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Look into the sun as the new days rise

There's a rhythm in rush these days
Where the lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean
There is a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming
Open your eyes
Look into the sun as a new days 

Oh, go to sleep

Not much of what you say makes any sense
Cook up some myths then ask for obedience
Even though you mean well, well most of the time
You've aided delusion and created bias in our minds

Oh, go to sleepYou might also 

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
You might also like
And you, you knew the hand of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good
