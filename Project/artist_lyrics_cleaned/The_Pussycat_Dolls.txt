The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is
The part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
