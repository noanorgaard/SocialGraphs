You waited for the lightning storm
Though it might be gone
Created for the life reborn
Though it might be long
Too late to change the road we're on
Though it might be wrong

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
We've come so far, what are you running for?
(Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
Don't leave me out, the world's in front of us, oh
(Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)

You waited for the lightning storm
Though it might be gone
Created for the life reborn
Though it might be wrong
