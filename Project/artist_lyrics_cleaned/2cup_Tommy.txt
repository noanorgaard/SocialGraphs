On my momma better mind your business
In that place that I was raised
We were southern fried like some chickens
Man it's realer than it's ever been
Used to look like pitty
Now its lookin' like envy bitch
I'm feelin' zoned out
4D
Hollar outta bound
Man you know I'm out the galaxy
I'm feelin' zoned out
Dope trees
Rollin' through Savanna than we pushin' back to Tennessee

Yeah
Ridin' through Savanna streets
Lookin' for a mouth
I can open just like can of peas
Man I'm hot so them bitches callin' me gasoline
B-b-basterd
Now watch me 'cause a catastrophe
Lavashly with my bag of weed
Don't pass it to me, I'm so gone
I'm way on top at that ozone
'Cause I mixed the codeine with a nose dose
Hold on, got a purple stain on my Polo
Oh no, got an other one sittin' on my photo
I don't even know where I'm cause I go home
Raised in the fuckin' street
I ain't talkin' hobo
Now I'm so flow
Chillin' with a Puerto Rican
Man that bitch so fine
Then she started to talk
So I had a tell her off
That was bad for the grind
Back to my state my state
Working over time bitch
I'm feelin' really zoned out
Kinda like I'm flyin'
I'm vibin'
Always lookin' vibrant
Tired like a motherfucker I ain't talkin' eyelids
What the fuck you though it was
I got it from nothin' about the mud
Call me crazy I go banana's got me zoned like the sections they livin' up in Atlanta, I'ma

Big Body swervin', Savanna back up to Antioch
Fat boy, smooth game, quick to make her panties drop
Old school Cadillac with the flip-flop
Made a livin' off my wrist but never bought a wrist watch
I'm ridin' through my city, I'm high as a balloon
And when I say I'm high I mean I'm up there by the moon
I got dirt all on my boots, girl I'm covered in mud
Go home and tell you're mother you fell in love with a thug
Me and Jojo blowin' doe doe, swervin' and sippin' shine
Problem with me gettin' mine, grab a number get in line
I do this for my people in the hood just gettin' by
I made it out alive without life prison time
My people still out there, i heard that they flippin' pies
If I had one wish, I wish all the snitches die
And tell 'em that's the truth
Yeah I know you feel it double cup
One middle finger ain't enough, i shoot a couple up
Told 'em bitch
