I remember Mama in a happy way

We went to school with holes in our shoes
We didn't have much, but the Lord saw us through
Mama kept the family together, yes, she did

I remember Mama in a happy way

She packed our lunch in an old grеasy bag
It might have seemed empty
But it was morе than others had
It had a lot of love way down deep inside, yes, it did, yeah

And I remember Mama in a happy way
I remember Mama, woah, in a happy way

Now Mama is sleeping in the bosom of Jesus Christ, yeah
Somehow I know she's smiling, she's smiling on us right now, look at her over there
One day, I’ll see her again, how happy I will be, yeah, yeah

I remember Mama in a happy way (Yeah, yeah)
I remember Mama in a happy way

My brothers and sisters, they’re living far apart
Although my Mama's gone, she’s right here in our hearts
We're all gonna pull together and stay in the Holy Place, why?

I remember Mama in a happy way (Oh, yeah)
I remember Mama in a happy way

You know I remember my Mama
When I was about twelve years old (I remember)
I was going to church, playin' church (Mama)
How many of you still play at church? Let me see your hand
Yeah, some of you, you still play
And I remember
I go there at Mount Calvary, that's where I belong (I remember)
And I'd jump, and I'd shout, and I'd come back home (Mama)
But I was still disobedient, I would talk back
And one day (I remember)
Me and Ann here
We decided that we're gonna play church (Mama)
Let me tell you what we did, we
We went out in the back and started playin' church
And my brother was the pastor (I remember)
Me and Ann here, we were the members in the church (Mama)
And let me tell you something
It's hard to come in contact with Jesus
And still be the same, I don't care who you are
I don't care, you can be the chiefest of sinners (In a happy way)
You will never be the same
And I won't forget nothing, going down to the church, playing church (I remember)
Came home, still disobedient (Mama)
Didn't wanna wash the dishes, didn't wanna bring the clothes in off the line
Didn't wanna do anything
Mama said, "I'm sick of you going down the church playin' with God"
Me and Ann there, we went outdoors, we started playin' church
Sat down on the bottom stair
My brother was a preacher, and we were the members in the church
And, he puts some old glasses and put them right here on his nose
And he said, "I," he said, "I want you jump up and shout Jesus three times"
And I jumped up and I shouted Jesus two times
But when I jumped up the third time, ha
Something got a hold of me
I couldn't see right there
Ann ran in the house
She said, "Mama, so Shirley is out there playing with the Lord"
Mama came to the door
When she looked out there and saw me shouting and dancing all over the back of the yard
Tears all over my face
It's just a life higher
Mama looked out there, and she said, "She ain't playing this time"
Hallelujah
And I remember Mama (Oh, Lord)
In a happy way (Yeah, I remember Mama, yeah)
I remember Mama (Oh yeah)
In a happy way (I remember Mama)
I remember Mama (She may be dead and gone, but I remember her)
In a happy way (I, I, I remember my Mama)
I remember Mama (Oh yeah)
In a happy
