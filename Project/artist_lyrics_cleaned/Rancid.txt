He's singin'
And she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee
But she will never understand
Once again he's leavin'
And she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture, it's time
Time to say goodbye

Ruby's heart ain't beatin'
'Cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew that
There's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance
As she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fadin' out, she disappears
It's time, time to say goodbye
