Been a dog in my family, drove from door to door
Been a dog in my family, drove from door to door
Since I swore to the Lord that I wouldn't be drove no more
I got a lovin' sweet woman, her name is Sadie Lee
I got a lovin' sweet woman, her name is Sadie Lee
I got a lovin' sweet woman, her name is Sadie Lee
I love lil' Sadie, but Sadie don't love me
I'm gonna buy me a pistol, mama, 's long as I am tall
Gonna buy me a pistol, 's long as I am tall
Buy me a pistol, long as I am tall
I'm gonna shoot lil' Sadie, see her rise and fall
I've been your dog, mama, ever since I been your man
I've been your dog ever since I been your man
I've been your dog, mama, ever since I been your man
Say now I'm leavin', try to do the best you can

Hard luck in the family, mama, done fell on me
Hard luck in the family done fell on me
I'm worried and troubled, sweet mama, as I can beYou might also
