Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers
Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby won't you come with me?

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go
Whatcha say we go, pickin' wildflowers?
Pickin'
