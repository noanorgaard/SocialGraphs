I guess you're okay
You go through my head now and then (Hi, Hey, Hi, Okay)
We watch what we say
We play hard to get, we pretend (Hi, Hey, Hi, Okay)
I don't know what's happened to me
But it won't disappear
I keep changing, saying things
I think you want to hear

I'm struggling to hold onto
Something close to you
And I'm coming up short
I choose to make the most of you

Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me, we're cowards
Never mind the shame
Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the pearly gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to say
You might also like
I bite and you scratch
We tense and relax, perfect match (Hi, Hey, Hi, Okay)
We both self destruct
We fight and we fu- (Hey) we make love (Hi, Okay)

I'm struggling to hold onto
Something close to you
And I'm coming up short
I choose to make the most of you

Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me, we're cowards
Never mind the shame
Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the pearly gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to say

We don't have to be the model couple
We could just be muddled up, I won't give it up
White flag on the nightstand
Right girl for the wrong man
Maybe we were made to
Dance around each other, babe
I don't know, I don't care
I'm just scared
Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me, we're cowards
Never mind the shame
Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the pearly gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to 

I left my mind in Vegas
I left my mind in Reno
I left my mind in London
I left my heart in Rio

If I never make it through the night
Before I should die
Then if this is the last song I write
I lived my life
And I'mma live like a king if it kills me
I'm a kid, seven sins couldn't thrill me
When it's said and done, and I'm leaving home
I'mma rise again, and I'mma rise alone
You might also like
I lost my soul on a roulette table
This never gets old, cause I'm unstable
Hit the ground running
It pulls me down, but I'm coming
I'm not unraveling, adrenaline, ketamine isn't my medicine
Living is better than methamphetamines
Fucking me up, just credit it "high on life", live twice
Never say die, I'm fine, I'll play the piper, whatever the price

I left my mind in LA (never say die)
I left my mind in Dallas (never say die)
I left my mind in Bristol
I left my heart in Paris

If I never make it through the night
Before I should die
Then if this is the last song I write
I lived my life
And I'mma live like a king if it kills me
I'm a kid, seven sins couldn't thrill me
When it's said and done, and I'm leaving home
I'mma rise again, and I'mma rise alone
Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away
Running, ru-running away
Yeah

I lost my mind in Brighton
I lost my mind in Rome
I lost my mind in Sydney
I lost my heart in - fuck it, I never had a heart

Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
