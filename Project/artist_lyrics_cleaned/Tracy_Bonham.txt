When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt?
Would I try a little tobacco?
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt?

I'm hungry
I'm dirty
I'm losin' my mind
Everything's fine
I'm freezing
I'm starving
I'm bleeding to death
Everything's fine

Yeah, I'm working, making money
I'm just starting to build a name
I can feel it, 'round the corner
I could make it any day
Mother Mother, can you hear me?
Sure I'm sober, sure I'm sane
Life is perfect, never better
Still your daughter, still the same

If I tell you what you want to hear
Will it help you to sleep well at night?
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear?
Now just cuddle up and sleep tight

I'm hungry
I'm dirty
I'm losin' my mind
Everything's fine
I'm freezin'
I'm starvin'
I'm bleeding to death
Everything's fine
I miss you
I love
