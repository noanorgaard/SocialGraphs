Well, I try and try to forget you, girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing you do
I know all the games you play
And I'm gonna find a way to let you know that
You'll be mine someday

'Cause we
Could be happy, can't you see?
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me

'Cause I try and try to forget you, girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing you do
You might also like
I don't ask a lot, girl (I don't ask a lot, girl)
But I know one thing's for sure (know one thing's for sure)
It's the love I haven't got, girl
And I just can't take it anymore


'Cause we
Could be happy, can't you see?
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me
'Cause it hurts me so just to see you go
Around with someone new

And if I know you, you're doing that thing
Every day just doing that thing
I can't take you doing that thing you
