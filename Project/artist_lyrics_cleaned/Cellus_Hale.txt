Hold up
I'm
I'm strapped like Robocop
Well
Minus the fact that Robocop
Was a cop
Some monkeys got lost but the show don't stop
Extra banana inside my sock
I don't believe half the shit I see
Cause they make anything in photoshop
I seen a picture with me and Barack
And I know damn well I wasn't there
Y'all know damn well I ain't vote
Nigga Jerry Lawler out running for mayor
Nothing new, we been at war
Machine guns in my inventory
I keep the tool, I'm the real McCoy
My favorite rapper is Tity Boi
My favorite actor is you so far
Your performance is award-winning
You couldn't be any more convincing
I would name drop but it'll spoil the ending
And don't you just hate when a nigga tell the whole movie
I got more RT's than the old Boosie
Used to serve out the phone like I drove Uber
Still will pipe your bitch down like Roto-Rooter
In that bitches mouth like a dental retainer
I'm still trying to learn how to channel my anger
I bring home the bread for me and my people
I keep what I need and share the remainder
So far to go but I ain't complaining
What good is complaining
I'm s'posed to be friendly because I'm famous
But mama told me never ever ever talk to strangers
So
You might also like
She just want to chill with my and smoke up all my weed
So I rolled up some of that moon rock
And the bitch went straight to sleep
Haha
Step Brothers
Step Brothers

Uh
Same clothes for the fifth day
Bankrolls on Forest Gump's friend's name
Benjamins blue Bubba Kush got a tint play
Once upon a time Reggie Bust kept the rent payed
Went to Middle Tennesee State
And I, and I used to middle man out
A mid gray ask Red Dot and I'm real jump shot
Pounds in the gym bag
Meet me in the parking lot look
I just want to short your sack and cop the cheapest pad
Profit me a stack
Don't try to jack I keep a gat
Look I'm the type to front you
Have my youngest take it back
And then play dumb
And front you something else for major tax
You can work it out
Phone ringing, guess my play
Hear them perky's calling
Got them tens for the nine like Iguodala
Keep being about mine
I need every dollar
Loratabs sell 'em five for the seven holler
Mac-11 for my ninety-nine problems
.357 snub fit right up my pocket
My young niggas likely to rob him or swipe him politely
Like what's in your wallet
No Capital One
Get my deposits in cash, half up front
Little whore in Wells Fargo said I was getting too much money
Cause I'm black and I'm young
I was like b-b-b-bitch
I dress like I hoop
I don't dress like I'm rich
But at the drive through might surprise you
Like
How the fuck he pull up in this
Shit bankroll match the turbo
Looking like new money
Just keep it one hundred
All a nigga do is smoke good weed
Fuck bad bitches
Argue with 'em and eat Benihana
Yeah
Beware the Ides of March
Step Brothers 3 that's coming
(March 15)
Beware the Ides of March
That's the 15th
Step Brothers

And that Red Dot Cell Blocks & Green Dots

Trash bags
Say that
And we
