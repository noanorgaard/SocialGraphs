Here it comes again, the beautiful warm weather
Right before the end of everything forever
The end of bars and clubs with lines around the block
The crowded dance floors winding up to feel the drop

So meet me by the river, let's go for a ride
With the windows down and the stereo loud

Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo

Hey, It's a new summer
Can we live here, like it's our last one?
Oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo

It never would have been as good if built to last
We never would have stood a chance if it didn't move fast
The end will come for holidays and sweet sixteen
For friends and getting lost in your computer screen

So meet me by the river, let's go for a ride
With the windows down and the stereo loud

Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo

Hey, it's a new summer
Can we live here, like it's our last one?
Oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo

Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Hey, it's a new summer
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Hey, it's a new summer
As we howl at the moo-oo-oo-oon
