I don't have digital
I don't have diddly-squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got

I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame, I'm lookin' up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it'd take
To win me some of your love

Every time I turn around
I'm lookin' up, you're lookin' down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do

I'm, I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame, I'm lookin' up

I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
I'm the one who has the key

Every time I turn around
I'm lookin' up, you're lookin' down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame, I'm lookin' up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up (To lighten up)
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame, I'm lookin' up (I'm lookin' up)

I'm gonna soak up the sun
I got my 45 on
So I can rock 

"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica 

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down
Real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

We've been far
Far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in-between

Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
Oh, 

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know, oh

The first cut is the deepest
