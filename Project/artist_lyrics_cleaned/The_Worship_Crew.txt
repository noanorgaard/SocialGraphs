(Verse1)
Just woke up in the morning gotta thank God, for some reason i think today is gonna be odd getting dressed i was throwing on a shirt today is Saturday and tomorrow is church, as i walk to the kitchen i grab something to eat walk out the door then slide the chucks on my feet, stop where you goin caught by my momma don't be going no where starting no drama, pssh they can meet my llama i ain't starting no problems im hanging down the street with this girl whos been tryna holla,alright be back by seven or else im sending you to heaven that's the saying in my house and im trying to sneak out,  but is it weird lately my mind has been off track gotta steep so low and get back on track cause thats what i need a treatment to recover erase the bad things and become more stronger, my room full of darkness my music up loud turning negatives to positives, soon making vows, gotta change my attitude got a bad reputation, changing my latitude to another different nation, my pocket full of money my brain full of knowledge combine them together time to start college, upgrading from high school to another level, leaving the old me behind goodbye Mr. Devil, yea its time to celebrate, yea its time to contemplate i may be off but listen to what i gotta say if you dont understand, you needa pay attention these words that im saying are describing my intentions forget what other people think bad news cause your opinion stinks on the reals it really does yea i went there call it push to shove, nobody's ever seen the dark side of me, look into my eyes then you'll feel my heat hold up !
Yea ima spit this last verse, listen up closely

David, im a weirdo rate me from 1 to 0 as i told all these people at least i am not basic, used to hate the fact that i was always downgraded but awaited never under estimated, went from being a loner to hanging out with stoners but was never one of them felt like a dead leaf on a stem always felt so over whelmed now look at me, im finally who i want to be, writing and composing rapping but not doing poetry, Im YoungDc im that young dream chaser, working my way up to get that big money paper, but i can't worship money gotta worship my creator, soon people will have me as their screensavers and wallpapers, i used to be a player messing around with a alot of girls, used to be a skater skating up and down all these roads, now im pursuing tryna reach my goal, ain't never ever ever going to sell my soul, but people want to run up every time that they see me nothing but fans freak off buy my CD, see these people dont understand that i really need some space acting like they ain't never seen my face paparazzi on my back they just dont understand, its funny they lucky i ain't got no gun in my hand GTA real life drug lords tryna assassinate me, but not really they just tryna get pictures with me, just a regular kid roaming these streets, ear buds in my ears basing to beats, instrumentals that go hard that can be played in your car, while crusin, bangin, down boulevard, GOOD music thats what it be getting out our dreams, this is the this is the odd life of youngdc
