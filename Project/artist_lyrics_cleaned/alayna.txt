And when the city beats too loud
And I just can't drown it out
You bring me clarity

So won't you stay 'til morning and treat me good?
Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good, yeah
Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good
And I'll treat you good too

Close the door, throw your day on the floor
Let it out, let it out
Falling autumn, expose your soul
Now I know, now I know

That when the city beats too loud
And I just can't drown it out
You bring me clarity
Oh and I just want someone close to me

Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good, yeah
Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too

There's nothing worse than getting lost
But nothing better to get lost with somebody, oh
So won't you do that with me?
So won't you do that with me? Oh, yeah
So won't you do that with me? Yeah, woah

So won't you stay 'til morning and treat me good?
Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good, yeah
Ooh, stay 'til morning and treat me good
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too

So won't you stay 'til morning and treat me good?
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good too
And I'll treat you good
