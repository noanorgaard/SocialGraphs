We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We are not where we belong
We have a hope
We're gonna live on forever
Forever, Forever

Breathing air we have never breathed
We'll see colors we've never seen
Every sound like a symphony
Rising up as the angels sing
The arms of grace are open wide
The face of love before our eyes
Where every tear will disappear
Heaven is real

We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We are not where we belong
We have a hope
We're gonna live on forever
Forever, Forever

Our hearts have been set in motion
For something more, for something more
Than we could ever imagine
There's so much more, there's so much more
Our hearts have been set in motion
For something more, for something more
Than we could ever imagine
There's so much more, there's so much more

We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We're gonna live on forever
Forever, forever
We are not where we belong
We have a hope
We're gonna live on forever
Forever,
