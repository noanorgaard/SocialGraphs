In fading light it's beautiful
This wind is blowing colder
And too soon I'll feel it's pull
Still, I took all my chances

For the road is long ahead
I'll be with you even though we're apart
But your road is yours to tread
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind
So it goes... and so it goes, and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind
I've grown old on this ocean
Gave her all, my stronger years
Gave my wife my devotion
When she died, the ocean my tears
I've tried to teach you well son
All of everything I knew
Of how to live this life be true
Don't bow your head to no one
And no matter what you do
If you start then see it through
So sturdy up, sturdy up your heart
For the road is long ahead
I'll be with you even though we're apart
But your road is yours to tread
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind
So it goes... and so it goes, and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mindYou might also
