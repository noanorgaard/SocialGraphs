I don't know what they're telling you
But I know we can turn it around
I know I've hurt you, and I've not been true

Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-
Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-
Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-
Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-
Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-
Keep our love so str-, keep our love so str-

Never give up, I never give up
It's never enough, it's never enough
You're not the one, scared that the sun
Won't shine on me

I've been holding on for
Some kind of miracle
I'll be right there
If you're ever alone
I've been holding on for
Some kind of miracle
I'll be right there
If you're ever alone

Every step I take is heavy with the thought of you
The moments I delay, I'll make you mine

Never give up, I never give up
It's never enough, it's never enough
You're not the one, scared that the sun
Won't shine on me
You might also like
I've been holding on for

I've been holding on for
Some kind of miracle
I'll be right there
If you're ever alone
Ever alone
And I'm holding
And I'm holding on

Ever holding yeah

And I'm holding on
And I'm holding
And I'm holding on
And I'm holding
