It's my duty to live up to the fantasies you've been dreamin' of
There is a fast way and a slow way, a something rough
Baby I, I can't conceal it, gotta reveal it
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva Ibetchaneva
There are no shortcuts, take the long way
Taste, touch and rub
Get up and get even tell her things that
Keep her hot for your love
Then find a rhythm, put a pep in your step
And I assure you that she'll be screaming your name
Give her the business, show her the business, boy
And do your business
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva Ibetchaneva
You might also likeYou got to become every fantasy
Til you got her seeing you like you're a trouble
You got to show her
Show her that you got so much more
Cause she's telling you she's had enough
And after all this is said and done
Don't ever kiss and tell
If you say what you're gonna do
Oh when you do it, you're gonna do it well
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva
Ibetchaneva felt you'd feel like this
I bet it feels like you never even kiss
Ibetchaneva felt the touch, you never felt the rush
Ibetchaneva
