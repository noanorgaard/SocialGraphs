Oh-a, oh-a
I met your children
Oh-a, oh-a
What did you tell them?

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-a-a-oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio (Oh-a)
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago (Oh-oh-oh-oh-a)
And you remember the jingles used to go
You might also like
Oh-a, oh-a
You were the first one
Oh-a, oh-a
You were the last one

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Oh-a-a-a-oh
Oh-a-a-a-oh

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put the blame on VCR
