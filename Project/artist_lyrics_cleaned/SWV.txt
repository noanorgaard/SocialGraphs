Could you be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (Need)
Someone to love me unconditionally (Unconditionally)
Could this be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (All I need)
Someone I can love unconditionally

Never been the frontin' type cause I believe
What you put up is what you will receive
And I'm giving everything I've got to give
It's the only way I know how to live
And I've been through ups and downs
And heartbreaks and lonely nights
And even when tears was dryin'
My soul was steady cryin'
But I'll never give up on this thing
No matter what the joy or pain

Is this reality or am I dreaming?
'Cause what I feel right now may not be what I see
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
And if you are, my heart's all yours

Could you be?
Be the one for me
That is really all I need (All I need)

Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be

No one can do
The things you do to me
Never to be mistaken
Long as it's love we're making
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain

But as long as I know
Boy, time will show
Our love will grow
And I know

Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
