Buy a big diamond ring for me?

Pop that pretty question right now, baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal, though

Got you wrapped around my finger, babe

Living life like I'm in a play
In the limelight I want to stay
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal, though

(Ooh) Going up, going down, down, down
(Yeah) Anything for the crown, crown, crown
(Wow) When the lights dimming down, down, down
I spin around
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all

Boys, they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing, "I lo-lo-love you"
