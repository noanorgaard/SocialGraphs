And it's a big old world we live in now
And how mighty it can be
And all this time, I pictured you standing next to me
So we could go find things we'd never seen

Cloud or the trees
Look to the top and see all that your eyes will let you see
Take the lead
Out to the streets as far as your lungs will carry you atop your feet
And it's the only, only, only time
It's the only time for you to be your own
And you told me, told me, told me I
Yeah, you told I will lead the life that I love

And it's a big old world we live in now
And how mighty it can be
And all this time, I pictured you standing next to me
So we could go find things we'd never seen

Oh, and all your days, you live life on the run
But now, you see your time has finally come

Seven days I'm going to call the wild in me
Carrying me, 'cross the world
Seven days I'm yours, I live all I need
To carry me to the north

When you told me I could go
Seven days, that can be hard when you lose all you need
Oh you aim, aim your heart

In my faded truck
We shot across the country to find our luck
And the youth inside would scream and shout
Like a dagger in the heart we ripped it out
And we had laugh through the night
Call the star´s
By the fire shining on
Through the night
We will run
To the rising life and on
Through the night
Burn the flames
The world will know our NamesYou might also
