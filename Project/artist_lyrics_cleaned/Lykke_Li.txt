I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me

And for you, I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I, you know I I would do it
Push a button, pull the trigger, climb a mountain, jump off a cliff
'Cause you know baby, I love you, love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
You would mean it and we could do it
It was you and I, not only I

I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me

Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything, to have you as my man
Come here, stay with me, stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything, to have you as my man

Little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in love with me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit, little bit

Little bit
Little bit
Little bit
Little bit

I know places we can go, babe
I know places we can go, babe
Where the highs won't bring you down, babe
No, the highs won't hurt you there, babe

Don't ask me when, but ask me why
Don't ask me how, but ask me where
There is a road, there is a way
There is a place, there is a place

I know places we can go, babe
Coming home, come unfold, babe
And the high won’t fade here, babe
No, the high won’t hurt here, babe

So come lay and wait
Now won't you lay and wait, wait on me

I know places we can go, babe
Coming home, come unfold, babe
I know places we can go, babe
Coming home, come unfold,
