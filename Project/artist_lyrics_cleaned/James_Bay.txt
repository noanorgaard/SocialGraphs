Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up
And I don't mean bleed
So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go
You might also like
Why don't you do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I've got something to hide
I'll keep on playing with you, yeah
You keep on calling me names
Sure, I can take the abuse
It's just a game

Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up
I don't mean bleed
So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go
All I know is I love it when our shit blows
We keep turning red hot and stone cold
Sweet burn inside
Deals get broke
We fall in and fall out
We're too close, it's dead love
Until curtains close and we come alive

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't beart to let, bear to let no
I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you 

And now we're sleeping at the edge, holdin' somethin' we don't need
All this delusion in our heads is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwin' clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slammin' doors at you
If this is all we're livin' for
Why are we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it anymore?

I used to recognize myself, it's funny how reflections change
When we're becomin' somethin' else, I think it's time to walk away

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine when we know it just don't belong
There’s no force on earth could make it feel right, no, woah
Tryna push this problem up the hill when it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, oh, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me
Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Oh, me, 

She's working late and making eyes at the door
She sick of everybody up on her floor
She wants the sun in her eyes but all she gets is ignored
She used to put it out and get it all back
But now she slipping trying to carry the act
She's sweating under the lights, now she's beginning to crack
Woah

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it

No hesitation now she gets up and walks
She thinks of all the pain and pride that they caused
She emptied all the tip jars and won't get back what she lost
You might also likeOutside the window with two fingers to show
She lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke
She doesn't have to look back to know when she's gotta go

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it

If you don't bleed it you don't need it anymore
If you don't need it get up and leave it on the floor
No more believing like its a voice you can't ignore
If you don't need it you don't need it, no

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
Oh oh oh no if you don't like 

Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire

Heading down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Street's are alive now and everything's bracing
You're on my mind, running in my veins
Fueling the flame, let's start it again (Start it again)

Fire, oh

Oh woah-oh oh woah-oh oh
Now don't tell me no, that we're burning down
Oh woah-oh oh woah-oh oh
And don't tell me no, that we're burning now

Cause I know, I know
That we're losing light and our love is dying
Take, take me home
Back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire

Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire
When we were on fire


I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around

Wanted to ask if we could have been
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal
You always had something effortless
At school you were the biggest deal
Little quirks close and open up
Time is slipping by
I'm always thinking 'bout the two of us
Replay on my mind
Always playing on my mind

I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love

We were young we were side by side
Don't know when we started losing touch
If you want we could walk around
Maybe that would be enough
Used to talk drinking to the night
I would wake up on the front room floor
All alone, you'd be in my bed
Make me crazy make me want you more

I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come

JUST the hooky episode i could not care less about the rest of the podcastthis year sucked but at least there was cool music
spotify wrapped 

And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can

As I'm sweeping up glass
I see the exit light so green
These people falling into the street
Something comes together
I've been here too long
And if I stay they'll tie me down
I know this chance won't hang around
So I'm gone forever
You might also like
And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can

Packing up my suitcase, racing down forgotten street
Making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
If you find me, you will find me on the run
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round their shopping carts
I've seen the greener grass, I've seen the faster cars
And I don't need your happy hours, I don't need your lonely bars
I'm ejecting like a bullet from a gun
So take your final look at me, maybe even take my hand
Standing on the staircase, come and chase the master plan
The long awaited getaway, play it like a grand slam
This is no encore, we have only just begun

So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still 

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I-I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we crawl against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I-I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back
