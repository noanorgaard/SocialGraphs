This is a war
And our blood will draw the battle lines
This is a war
And our blood will draw the battle lines

We will stand
We will fight
We can't stop
Till we die
Hope will be torn
Whose side are you fighting for...
This is a war

Lies will burden the soul
And pull it into the deep
Everything that we know will be just out of reach
You might also like
Cause this is a war
And our blood will draw the battle lines
This is a war
And our blood will draw the battle lines
