My heart
My heart
My heart
My heart

I was a wasteland, where nothing could grow
But everything changed when, You called it Your Home
Now I'm a kingdom, You sit on the throne
Broke my defenses, made me Your own
Now

You have won my heart
You have won my heart
From the heights, to the shores
Every part, I am Yours
You have won my heart
You have won my heart
All of me surrendering
What a sweet victory

My heart
My heart
My heart
My heart
You might also like
Your love is a soldier, fighting a war
Broke through the front lines, to stand in my door

You have won my heart
You have won my heart
From the heights, to the shores
Every part, I am Yours
You have won my heart
You have won my heart
All of me surrendering
What a sweet victory

My heart
My heart
My heart
My heart

Beautiful in defeat
Completely surrendered
I surrender
Never knew I could be
So free in surrender
I surrender
Beautiful in defeat
Completely surrendered
I surrender
Never knew I could be
So free in surrender
I surrender ohhh

You have won my heart
You have won my heart
From the heights, to the shores
Every part, I am Yours
You have won my heart
You have won my heart
All of me surrendering
What a sweet victory
You have won my heart
You have won my heart
From the heights, to the shores
Every part, I am Yours
You have won my heart
You have won my heart
All of me surrendering
What a sweet victory
