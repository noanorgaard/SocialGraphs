Give me a game and I'll play good
They should listen to the master
Instead of running around like headless chickens that's wayward
Wouldn't do the job if the job didn't pay good
They should give me all the good jobs
Don't call anybody at home reserving who don't deserve it
Thinking your careers gonna stay good
Better stay hood, my musics much better when it never got made in Greywood
Talking, walking, merking Wiley is so awkward
Send your top soundboy forward
It's you again, the boy from unsure wood
Don's covering it, you got your face on the floor wood
When I keep Fire Camp going need more wood
Sure I could do with a few more stars
I'll spin Fire Camp from Stratford to Norwood
Say my name I'll run up on your set like

I'm from Rawwood
Buy a big yard in Meadway, floors wood
They're not doing what me and my top 4 could
I spin them on my own like, me and my top 4 would
Sure would, I sure would
Real guns not rebore wood
Going on tour could make me rich in a flash
Dipping your gash, oh, he's a whore should
You tried to take me out
Get a shotgun, I rally up, bally up
Run up in your house, I'm an E3 g
We start running up in houses, turn fakers into mouses, turn over houses
No respect for people's things, breaking people's chins, I take peoples grins
I'm a a fly boy, fly boy, repping for the wing
I got a bigger family than Patel and Singh
Better know that I'm never in a no long ting
Run up in your house like action and ping

Can't tell me nothing, listen (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?

Yo, yo
I got bored in the proudest pavilion
But I'm still a bad boy from the Caribbean
And you think that you're straight up brilliant
I will come through I will show you real-liant
You can never kick ball like a Brazillian
I'm a top boy never going down hill-ian
William, William, William, William
5 years gone and past and I'll famil-ian
Blud, you're the one that got smacked in the grill-ian
You might know my name, that's William
We know you ain't got skill-ian
Ain't gonna ever make a million
Flyin' in, headbutt and still-ion
I remain calm still standing William
Against bare man I'm a dan still living and
Watch this year I'm down 2 nillion
It's gonna be 3-2 when I'm finished
(Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?)
I was like, I was like (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?)
I had to tell 'em because I was so amazed (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?)
That, they would try and go against me (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?)
I was like, sorry? Sorry? What? (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?)
I was like, sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What? (Sorry? Sorry? Pardon? What?
Could've got bored up, could've got shot)
E3 all day, Eskiboy, Tunnel Vision
