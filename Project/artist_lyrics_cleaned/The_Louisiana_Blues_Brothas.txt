Yeah we been going through it
We been feeling overthrown
We Been feeling overthrown yea
X2 *
My nigga montaz lost cousin to a shootin
Left a family in tears revenge clearly being wanted. *
I swear I see my brother die every time it’s mentioned
He stay broken hearted
Keep your head up
Alejandro gon through it too, east coast kid from the CT
He gotta story just like me
Lost his boy to suicide and I can relate
(DJ n)
Had blue chrome barrel Ak to my dome on Easter Day
Had a bone to pick with myself
I had to Break through this self - doubt
Mentally I’ve been going through a real dry drought. ( ad lip or echo)
The big man medicate but the god can’t dictate his natural self born fate
He was born to be a prophet
To those who struggle with stacking stones and crumbling homes
Support his family in every different way
Until the day come that he got to defend his ritche name
Play the Ritchie family game
My nigga Olivera Puerto Rican down to the sooooocks
Bacardi in the solo, fucking bitches in his flip flops
Rough times after the
Louisiana slaughter
Coming back home happy thinking all we got is each other
Car crash this nigga left my brother dying on the side road!
He was disloyal down to them filthy ass bones
(Dj - n)
This nigga was a snake. when I see him it’s bullets straight to the face . ( gun smoke gun smoke )
It’s bullets straight to the face
We need to start working on the art of forgiveness
Cause this hate got me acting reckless
There’s nothing I want more than to see justice in my brother lives
We’ve been damaged so much and its only year 25
Brought feelings of revenge it’s not a disadvantage!
No no no
It’s just
Hate ain’t the order of business
Should’ve seen how broken my nigga Jan was after being left like a burden
Can’t believe after so many years you was just a snake in the garden
Teach us all how quick a nigga can change
Old friends turn enemies I light em up like a firing him
Damn why is life being so strange
Give you fake praise to your face
But start talking shit when you turn away
How quick someone can flip that switch
Try to sell themselves to you with that weak ass sales pitch
They supporters one day
But start hating cause they can’t elevate the same way
I’m used to it though cause haters gonna hate x2!!

Yeah we been going through it
