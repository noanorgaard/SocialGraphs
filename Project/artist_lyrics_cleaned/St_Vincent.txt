New love wasn't true love, back to you, love
So much for a home run with some blue bloods
If I last-strawed you on 8th Avenue

I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again
I have lost a hero

But for you, darling
I'd do it all again

New York isn't New York without you, love
Too few of our old crew left on Astor
So, if I trade our hood for some Hollywood
Well, you're the only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who'll forgive me

Girls in cages playin' their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car, oh, ah-ah
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep

From guru to voodoo and voodoo to zen

Come all you wasted, wretched, and scorned
Come watch me standin' under the wall
