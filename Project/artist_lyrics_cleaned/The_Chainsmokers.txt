What would I do
What wouldn't I do to save you
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you 

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over
Ever since I left you, I've been tryna get you back
And it keeps gettin' worse
I'm burning on the inside and the truth is that I
Didn't know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it's been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I'm finding, that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, oh, won't you just come home

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over
Ever since I left you, I've been tryna get you back
And it keeps gettin' worse
I'm burning on the inside and the truth is that I
Didn't know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
