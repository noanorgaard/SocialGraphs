Give me a Saturday night, my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six-pack of light
An old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
And I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ol' small town USA

Give me a Saturday night, my baby by my side
David Allan Coe and a six-pack of light

Give me a Sunday mornin' that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah

Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar
In the backwoods, yeah, we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

Preacher's daughter couldn't get hotter
Floating that river on an inner tube with her, splash
35's and a lift kit how stuck can you get
Ain't that just my luck where's the chain I'm stuck

Out in the backwoods down in the holler

Got the Kenwoods bangin that rock n' roll
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
I love the way you lean that seat back, steal my ball-cap
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watchin' your hair fly out the window
Just lettin' the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes

We can run the reds down Mainstreet dodging the blue lights
Or disappear off into the corn out past the county line
Baby keep on keep on swaying to the back-beat
Long as you're right here right here beside me
You make the call baby, I don't care
We can take this anywhere

And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce 'em to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror, we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him huntin' one more time
Ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
"Me and Bobby McGee"

Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

Sit down and tell you your looks could kill

Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you

Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone
I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook

Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama back in his hometown?
Does he drive the interstate or does he take them ole back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song every good ole boy should know?
I didn't think so

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
