I saw you, yeah, you, you're breaking down
I hope you, yeah, you, you come around
Now don't you shut this down
Ooh, no, don't you give this up
I took all this love I found
And I hope that it's enough
Is it enough?

If we don't bend, then this might break
Please don't give into this pain
Just keep on counting down the days
And dream of me to keep you safe
Don't you shut this down
No, don't you give this up
I took all this love I found and I hope that it's enough

Don't you shut this down
Don't you give this up

Before you came around
I was lost and out of place
You're the only love I found and I'm hoping that you'll stay
Please stay

I know it's warmer where you are
And it's safer by your side
But right now, I can't be what you want
Just give it time

And if you and I can make it through the night (Oh-oh-oh)
And if you and I can keep our love alive, we'll find

We can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I
For you and I

I know it's cold when we're apart
And I hate to feel this die

But for now, we stay so far
'Til our lonely limbs collide
I can't keep you in these arms
So I'll keep you in my mind (Reachin' out)
But for now, we stay so far (Freakin' out)

So just trust me, you'll be just fine
And I need your trust just for tonight

This is not a place in my head
Reach out your hands and tell me just what you feel, oh-oh
This is not just all in your head
Mind over matter makes these things feel so real, oh-oh-oh

I can see the doubt in your eyes
You say there's no such thing as better things in life
Well, I must confess this is all too new for me
A whole new world, a whole new world to see

Just trust me, you'll be just fine
