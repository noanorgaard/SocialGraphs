I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first 'round here, anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I came home with a brand-new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up a holler down Copperhead Road
And now the DEA's got a chopper in the air
I wake up screamin' like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie, don't you know?
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

Whoa
Copperhead Road
Copperhead Road
Ha, Copperhead
