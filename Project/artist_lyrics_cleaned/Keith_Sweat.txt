Been all day thinkin’, all night wonderin’
Why love has to change
You kiss me, but it’s not real
Tell me what happened
Are we living a lie, baby
Is that magic gone
Ooh, do you feel the same way you used to, girl
Ooh, tell me is it wrong for us to love like this

How deep is your love 
How deep is your love 
How deep is your love 
Oh…ho…oh…oh… 

You run your fingers through my hair
You tell me you love me
You act like everything between us is alright, girl
But you know, you know that it’s not true
You love me or do you wanna leave me, baby
Tell me, girl, I can take it
Something’s just not right, I don’t know, no
Tell me how deep is your love

Because my heart is where your love is at
