To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me

One night of magic rush
The start: a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me
You might also like
And you, you knew the hand of a devil
And you, kept us awake with wolves teeth
Sharing different heartbeats in one night

To call for hands of above, to lean on
Would that be good enough for me
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for
