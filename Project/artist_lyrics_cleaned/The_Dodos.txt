To have the chance to be so kind
To someone else who doesn't mind
Is getting rare and often times
It seems to scare the wandering eye
Looking always
Saying "I'll wait"

This convalesce it is broke
Comforts the test letting go
You snare the game of our heart
But you went gone
So please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard
Please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard

I wandered off under the news
The bezzle town on troll abuse
Just thinking of some name I knew
Without a sense of self to use
Saying "I'll wait"
Saying "always"

And offer come, as soon as I
Knew who it was who wasn't mine
You had convinced me of the white
And so I left myself behind
Saying "I'll wait"
Saying "always"

This convalesce it is broke
Comforts the test letting go
You snare the game of our heart
But you went gone
So please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard
Please stow this heart
It's cold, it's

His son is his prize, he tells a few lies
He's got his father's eyes, it's in his father's eyes
And he thinks in his mind that he's just getting by
But he's a compromise, he's just a compromising

Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool
Fool, fool, fool

And the stance that we take isn't much to bear
Yeah, we leave things to change on their time
And our failure to care for it leaves us blind
'Til we're tired and we're crazed in the mind

Now he lies on his back, and they tell him it's that
It's just a heart attack, it's just a heart attack
Too late to return to the ones that you've earned
No they don't give it back, no they don't give it back to

Fools, fools, fools

I've been, I've been silent

Man, I've been wasting so much time
Walking the same street every night
Don't you think maybe it's about time?

You can light the fire that's in your head
Put it off, tomorrow will come instead
We don't watch the tower that tells us when
Pull the wicked flower out from its bed

Man's been wasting so much time
Sending the children out to fight
Don't you think maybe it's about time?You might also 

Restlessness
In the light of the morning
What is real?
Are my words still as empty?
As they were
