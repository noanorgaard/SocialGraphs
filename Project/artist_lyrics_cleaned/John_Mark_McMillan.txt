Oh, how He loves us so
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so


He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are and
How great Your affections are for me

So we are His portion and He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking
So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way

Yeah, He loves us
Whoa, how He loves us

Oh I thought about You
The day Stephen died and You met me
Between my breaking
I know that I still love You God
Despite the agony
…to tell me You’re cruel
But if Stephen could sing
He’d say its not true…
Cause He loves us
Whoa, how He loves us
Whoa, how He loves us
Whoa, how He loves
Yeah, He loves us

I just wanna touch You
I just wanna make You move
I can't get over You
The way You slide into the room
Yeah, I just wanna touch You
I just wanna make You move
I can't get over You
The way You slide into the room

Would You save me for a song
If I didn't have the words to say?
Would You listen to me anyway?
Would You help me out?
For the chance that I could know You now
I would bury my pride in the ground
'Cause if I'm running then I don't know how
I'm ever gonna get back home
