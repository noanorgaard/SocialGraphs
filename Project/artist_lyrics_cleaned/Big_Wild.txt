Now think about it how cool it would it be
To have diamonds on the soles of my feet
But I worn these sneakers since I was 13
It's just cruel, it ain't sweet
Count my blessings easily
It goes 3, 2, 1, me

You want some of that green rain?
That chi-kaching, chi-kaching
You want a 20 karat ball and chain?
Kaching, kaching
You want a pilot and a jet plane?
They go a chi-kaching, chi-kaching
Newsflash, it ain’t worth the pain
Kaching, kaching
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Think about how chic it would be
With rhinestones on my sheets
Like a queen, pockets leak
Mmm, so empty indeed
And that's just cruel, it ain't sweet
I give up so easily
It's still 3, 2, 1, me

You want some of that green rain?
That chi-kaching, chi-kaching
You want a 20 karat ball and chain?
Kaching, kaching
You want a pilot and a jet plane?
They go a chi-kaching, chi-kaching
Newsflash, it ain't worth the pain
Kaching, kaching

Ain't got no money, I ain't got no power
Can't find the floor and this beat's getting louder
Give into me, come on, give me some
Ouch!
Watch those golden gates
Open up for me
With a 20 karat ball and chain
I will make it rain
You want some of that green rain?
That chi-kaching, chi-kaching
You want a 20 karat ball and chain?
Kaching, kaching
You want a pilot and a jet plane?
They go a chi-kaching, chi-kaching
Newsflash, it ain't worth the pain
Kaching,
