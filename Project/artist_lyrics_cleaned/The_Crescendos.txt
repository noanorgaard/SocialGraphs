You Know Me!

My Palms steady itching, you know my palms steady itchin'
I’mma die for the digits, you know i'll die for the digits

Riding dirty with my shooters on a sunday
We some wild dogs, we stay barking till the sundown
Overzealous, they ain't Know we learned the hard way
Get secure, gon grab a toolie or you found dead
Came from nothing, got me flossing on these fraudsters
Best believe this shii is war, boy you don’t want no smoke
Pour a four up for my squad we've come a long way
Slaying shii like it's a war, they say we 'bove the law
A Born Winner
No days off, I'm no pretender
Take 2 shots off my tequilla
Grateful for this good life i'm living
Way back I was broke and bitter
Bloodstains on my hands no kidding
Savage beast in the streets, i'm Godzilla
Nothing but the grind, i'mma die for the cheddar
Now I’m dripping they envy me
They draining in jealousy
They poisoned my meal again
They say watch what you eating now
They wait for the death of me
They hate on my melodies
Ain’t nobody passed me the torch
But i'm blazing and they can’t stop my shine, nooo!
I'm the wildest on the planet
I'm working extra like a slave
Breaking out the basement
Recognize i'm sick and tired of living in the grave
Kept my head above the waves
Prayed the Lord i drown in wealth
Mahn, if Jehovah hadn’t changed my status
Might have put a bullet in my Head
You might also like
My Palms steady itching, you know my palms steady itchin'
(I'm a Savage Beast for this money)
I'mma die for the digits, you know i'll die for the digits
(I'm a Savage Beast for this money)

Damn it my Gees! I got my mind made up
Tag me the villain like Darth Vader
This not the remix it's the fucking re-up
Plus these Lean and Gin still be fucking me up
Damn it my Gees! I got my mind made up
Tag me the villain like Darth Vader
This not the remix it's the fucking re-up
Plus these Lean and Gin still be fucking me up
She say forget say u get big dick, make u keep your eyes on the ball
She say don't fuck with these fools, so u fit to join your guys dey ball
If anything go fit to kill you, then e go be my love for alcohol
Her jeep been dey for car wash, so we been dey ride in one accord
While y'all Niggas doing talking, all my Niggas stalking Milly
I ain't talking bout the thousands, I'm talking Milly Jocky Milly
Niggas ain't gat no deals yet, but they know what the deal is
All my Niggas catching feelings, all your Niggas in they feelings
Since teenage days I've been a savage to the hoes
Fucking bitches and giving henny to these hoes
Naked like the truth, like I ain't gat no single clothes
Home is where the heart is, so I keep my city close
My Palms steady itching, you know my palms steady itchin'
(I'm a Savage Beast for this money)
I'mma die for the digits, you know i'll die for the digits
(I'm a Savage Beast for this money)

Selling my soul on a platter of gold
Patinum or gold
No nigga can muster the money so nigga, it's public i go
Get a piece of me, piecing my self together while I'm taking a piss on your flow
We are two peas in a pod
Taking a piss on your broad
Know it ain't personal, i gotta even the odds
I'm not the evil, I'm god
You had your time but you left it in prague
West African time, my nigga you're jet lagged
This is my era, my era for eons my nigga just come with the next batch
Reincarnate or whatever, just come when the robots rule
This is some gospel shit. I hope that it gets to your cohorts too
On some french shit, never salut me
On some Major General shit, salute me
Ask if I've had my hands in your lady's coochie
Absolutely
That's not a place I'm taking my lips though
I got funds in a couple cryptos
I just wanna take fam out that limbo
I just wanna put fam in a lambo
I've got mouths to feed bro
Winning em bread has never been beans bro
Handle a mic like she handle a dildo
Pleasure that comes as i crescendo
Loose my patience, tied the ends tho
No loose ends, don't leave momentos
Don't lose the tempo, hop in the benzo
