Oh man, oh my, oh me
Oh man, what I used to be
Oh man, oh my, oh me

In dearth or in excess
Both the slave and the empress
Will return to the dirt, I guess
Naked as when they came
I wonder if I'll see
Any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling
Nobody else to blame

Gold teeth and gold jewelry
Every piece of your dowry
Throw them into the tomb with me
Bury them with my name
Unless I have someday
Ran my wandering mind away

Oh man, what I used to be

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made
Pallid animals in the snow-tipped pines I find
Hatching from the seed of your thin mind all night

With a vision of a gentle coast

Brother, you don't need to turn me away

See your rugged hands and a silver knife
Twenty dollars in your hand that you hold so tight
All the evidence of your vagrant life
My brother, you were gone
And you will try to do what you did before
Pull the wool over your eyes for a week or more
Let your family take you back to your
Original mind

There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can say, I can say

Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us, follow my ornate song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning

You should come back home, back on your own now
Woah-ho-oh

The world is alive now, in and outside our home
You run through the forest, settle before the sun
Darling, I can barely remember you beside me (Woah-ho-oh)

You should come back home, back on your own now
Woah-ho-oh
You should come back home, back on your own now

In the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Jonathan and Evelyn get tired
Woah-ho-oh, oh-oh-oh

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright

I went down among the dust and pollen
To the old stone fountain in the morning after dawn
Underneath were all these pennies
Fallen from the hands of children
They were there and then were gone

And I wonder what became of them
What became of them
Sunlight over me no matter what I do

Apples in the summer, all cold and sweet
Everyday a'passin complete

I'm not one to ever pray for mercy
Or to wish on pennies in the fountain or the shrine
But that day, you know, I left my money
And I thought of you only
All that copper glowing fine

In the morning, waking up to terrible sunlight
All diffuse like skin abused, the sun is half its size
When you talk you hardly even look in my eyes
In the morning, in the morning
In the doorway, holding every letter that I wrote
In the driveway, pulling away, putting on your coat
In the ocean, washing off my name from your throat

Green apples hang from my tree
They belong only to me
Green apples hang from my green apple tree
They belong only to, only to me
And if I just stay a while here staring at the sea
And the waves break ever closer, ever near to me
I will lay down in the sand and let the ocean lead
Carry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze

I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

Here to face the fortune and the bile
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile
In the city only for a while

I walk with others in me yearning to get out
Claw at my skin and gnash their teeth and shout
One of them wants only to be someone you'd admire
One would as soon just throw you on the fire

God only knows which of them I'll becomeYou might also
