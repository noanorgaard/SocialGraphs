Damn!

Ninety-six thousand

Dollas? Holla!

Ninety-six thousand

Yo, somebody won!

Ninety-six thousand!

Yo, if I won the lotto tomorrow, well, I know
I wouldn't bother goin' on no spendin' spree
I pick a business school and pay the entrance fee
Then maybe if you're lucky, you'll stay friends with me
I'll be a businessman, richer than Nina's daddy
Donald Trump and I on the links, and he's my caddy
My money's makin' money, I'm goin' from po' to mo' dough
Keep the bling, I want the brass ring, like Frodo
You might also like
Oh no, here goes Mr. Braggadocio
Next thing you know, you're lying like Pinocchio

Yo, if you're scared of the bull, stay out the rodeo

Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in Tokyo
Ooh, you better stop rappin', you not ready
It's gonna get hot and heavy
And you already sweaty

Yo-yo-yo! Yo!

Yo! I'm sorry, is that an answer?
Shut up, go home and pull ya damn pants up!
As for you, Mr. Frodo of the Shire
Ninety-six Gs ain't enough to retire

C'mon, I'll have enough to knock your ass off its axis
You'll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes

Ninety-six thousand!

¡Ay, alabanza!

Ninety-six thousand!

¡No me diga!

Ninety-six thousand!

I never win shit

Ninety-six thousand!

For real, though, imagine how it would feel goin' real slow
Down the highway of life with no regrets
And no breakin' your neck for respect or a paycheck
For real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel and we'll throw
The biggest block party, everybody here
It's a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy
Yo, Ma, it's me, check my tickets

Check one, two, three
What would you do with ninety-six Gs?

Who me?

I mean if it's just between you and me

Esa pregunta es tricky

I know

With ninety-six Gs
I'd start my life with a brand new lease
Atlantic City with a Malibu Breeze

And a brand new weave!

Or maybe just bleach...

Y'all are freaks

Yo, I'm just sayin'...
(sung)
It's silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals
You really want some bread? Then go ahead create a set of goals
And cross 'em off the list as you pursue ‘em
And with those ninety-six, I know precisely what I'm doin'

What you doin'?

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
Sonny can keep the coffee brewin'
I'll spend a few on you
‘Cause the only room with a view is a room with you in it
And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
Just fly me down to Puerto Plata, I'll make the best of it
You really love this business?

No

Tough, Merry Christmas
You're now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits!
Yo, with ninety-six thousand, I'd finally fix housin'
Give the barrio computers with wireless web browsin'
Your kids are livin' without a good edjumication
Change the station, teach 'em about gentrification
The rent is escalatin'

What?!

The rich are penetratin'

What?!

We pay our corporations when we should be demonstratin'

What?!

What about immigration?

What?!

Politicians be hatin'

What?!

Racism in this nation's gone from latent to blatant

Ooh!

I'll cash my ticket and picket, invest in protest
Never lose my focus 'til the city takes notice
And you know this man! I'll never sleep
Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep

You are so cute!

I was just thinkin' off the top of my head

Ninety-six K, go​

If I win the lottery, you'll never see me again

Damn, we only jokin', stay broke then

I'll be downtown
Get a nice studio, I'll get out of the barrio

If I ​win the ​​lottery
You'll wonder where I've been

Como siempre, Señor Usnavi.​

I am Usnavi and you prob'ly never heard my name
Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax
Is highly complicated 'cause I immigrated
From the single greatest little place in the Caribbean
Dominican Republic, I love it!
Jesus, I'm jealous of it, and beyond that
Ever since my folks passed on, I haven't gone back
Goddamn, I gotta get on that
You might also like(spoken)
¡Fo!
(sung)
The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?
I better step it up and fight the heat
'Cause I'm not makin' any profit if the coffee isn't light and sweet!

Ooh!

Abuela, my fridge broke. I got café but no "con leche."

Try my mother's old recipe: one can of condensed milk.

Nice.​


¡Ay! Paciencia y fe…
That was Abuela, she's not really my abuela
But she practically raised me, this corner is her escuela
Now, you're prob'ly thinkin', "I'm up shit's creek
I never been north of Ninety-Sixth Street”
Well, you must take the A Train
Even farther than Harlem to northern Manhattan and maintain
Get off at One Eighty-First and take the escalator
I hope you're writin' this down, I'm gonna test ya later
I'm getting tested, times are tough on this bodega
Two months ago, somebody bought Ortega's
Our neighbors started packin' up and pickin' up
And ever since the rents went up
It's gotten mad expensive, but we live with just enough

In the Heights, I flip the lights and start my day
There are fights
And endless debts

And bills to pay

In the Heights, I can't survive without café
I serve café

'Cause tonight seems like a million years away
En Washington—

Next up to bat, the Rosarios
They run the cab company,​ they struggle in the barrio
See, their daughter Nina's off at college, tuition is mad steep
So they can't sleep, everything they get is mad cheap
Good morning, Usnavi

Pan caliente, café con leche

Put twenty dollars on today's lottery

One ticket, that's it!

Hey! A man's gotta dream

Don't mind him, he's all excited
‘Cause Nina flew in at 3 a.m. last night

Don't look at me, this one's been cookin' all week
Usnavi, come over for dinner

There's plenty to eat
So then Yesenia walks in the room...

Ah-ha

She smells sex and cheap perfume

Uh-oh

It smells like one of those trees
That you hang from the rear view

Ha-ha, no!

It's true! She screams, “Who's in there with you, Julio?”
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door
He's in bed with José from the liquor store!

¡No me diga!

Daniela and Carla, from the salon.​

Thanks, Usnavi!

Sonny, you're late.​

Chillax! You know you love me.​

Me and my cousin runnin'
Just another dime-a-dozen mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
And, oh my god, it's gotten too darn hot
Like my man Cole Porter said
People come through for a few cold waters and
A lottery ticket, just a part of the routine
Everybody's got a job, everybody's got a dream
They gossip, as I sip my coffee and smirk
The first stop as people hop to work
Bust it— I'm like:
"One dollar, two dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine
I got it, you want a box of condoms? What kind?
That's two quarters,​ two quarter waters
The New York Times
You need a bag for that? The tax is added"
Once you get some practice at it
You do rapid mathematics automatically
Sellin' maxi-pads, fuzzy dice for taxicabs
Practically everybody's stressed, yes
But they press through the mess
Bounce checks and wonder what's next

In the Heights
I buy my coffee and I go (I buy my coffee and—)
Set my sights
On only what I need to know (What I need to know)
In the Heights
Money is tight, but even so (But even so)
When the lights go down, I blast my radio

You ain't got no skills
Benny!
Yo, lemme get a—

Milky Way

Yeah, lemme also get a—

Daily News

And a—

Post

And most important, my—

Boss's second coffee, one cream—

Five sugars

I'm the number-one earner

What?!

The fastest learner

What?!

My boss can't keep me on the damn back burner

Yes, he can
I'm makin' moves, I'm makin' deals
But guess what?

What?

You still ain't got no skills

Hardee-har
Yo, Vanessa show up yet?

Shut up!

Hey little homie, don't get so upset

Man...

Tell Vanessa how you feel, buy the girl a meal
On the real, or you ain't got no skills


No! No, no, no!
No no no, no-no-no, no, no-no-no!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no!
Mr. Johnson, I got the security deposit
It's locked in a box in the bottom of my closet
It's not reflected in my bank statement
But I've been savin' to make a down payment and pay rent
No, no, I won't let you down

Yo, here's your chance, ask her out right now!

I'll see you later, we can look at that lease
Do somethin', make your move, don't freeze!
Hey!
You owe me a bottle of cold champagne

Are you moving?
Just a little credit check and I'm on that downtown train

Well, your coffee's on the house

Okay

Usnavi, ask her out

No way

I'll see you later, so…

Ooh, smooth operator, aw, damn, there she goes!
Yo, bro, take five, take a walk outside
You look exhausted, lost, don't let life slide
The whole hood is struggling, yeah, times are tight
And you're stuck to this corner like a streetlight
Yeah, I'm a streetlight, chokin' on the heat
The world spins around while I'm frozen to my seat
The people that I know all keep on rollin' down the street
But every day is different so I'm switchin' up the beat
'Cause my parents came with nothing, they got a little more
And sure, we're poor, but yo, at least we got the store
And it's all about the legacy they left with me, it's destiny
And one day I'll be on a beach with Sonny writin' checks to me

In the Heights, I hang my flag up on display

We came to work and to live and we got a lot in common

It reminds me that I came from miles away

D.R., P.R., we are not stoppin'

In the Heights

Every day, paciencia y fe

Until the day we go from poverty to stock options

In the Heights, I've got today

And today's all we got, so we cannot stop
This is our block

In the Heights, I hang my flag up on display

¡Lo le lo le lo lai lai lo le!

It reminds me that I came from miles away

My family came from miles away

In the Heights
It gets more expensive every day

Every day

And tonight is so far away

But as for mañana, mi pana
Ya gotta just keep watchin'

You'll see the late nights (In the Heights)
You'll taste ​beans and rice (In the Heights)
The syrups and ​shaved ice
I ain't gonna say it twice (In the Heights)
So turn up the stage lights (Ah)
We're takin' a flight
To a couple of days
​In the life of what it's like
¡En Washington 

Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

Who did this, Alexander, did you know?
Mom, I’m so sorry for forgetting what you taught me

My son—
We played piano

I taught you piano

You would put your hands on mine

You changed the melody every time

Ha. I would always change the line

Shh. I know, I know

Pardon me
Are you Aaron Burr, sir?
That depends, who's asking?

Oh, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

I'm getting nervous

Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours
I may have punched him
It's a blur, sir
He handles the financials?
You might also like
You punched the bursar

Yes
I wanted to do what you did
Graduate in two, then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid
So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

You're an orphan
Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war
Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for

Can I buy you a drink?

That would be nice

While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
What?

Smile more
Ha
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

You can't be serious

You wanna get ahead?

Yes

Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

A-ya-yow, ya-yow-yow
What time is it?
Show time

Like I said
Show time, show time, yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be
A-two pints of Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh
Those redcoats don't want it with me
'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops 'til I'm free
Ay, oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir"
Tell the King "Casse-toi", who's the best?
C'est moi
Brah, brah
I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it
Yes, I heard ya mother said, "Come again?"
Ayy

Lock up ya daughters and horses
Of course it's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets

Wow

No more sex, pour me another brew, son
Let's raise a couple more

To the revolution!

Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college

Aaron Burr

Give us a verse, drop some knowledge

Good luck with that: You're takin' a stand
You spit, I'ma sit, we'll see where we land
Boo

Burr, the revolution's imminent
What do you stall for?

If you stand for nothin', Burr, what'll you fall for?

Ooh

Who are you?

Who are you?

Who are you?

Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna

A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spendin' spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me

He says in parentheses

Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

And I am not throwin' away my shot (My shot)
I am not throwin' away my shot (My shot)
Ay, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry

Ay, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
It's time to take a shot
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy
'Onarchy? How you say, how you s-oh, "anarchy"
When I fight, I make the other side panicky with my—

Shot
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joinin' the rebellion, 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
I'm gonna take a—

Shot
Ay, but we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I, do or die, wait 'til I sally in on a stallion
With the first black battalion
Have another—
Shot
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep outta trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught
If you talk, you're gonna get shot

Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is
Oh, am I talking too loud?
Sometimes I get overexcited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

I am not throwin' away my shot
I am not throwin' away my shot
Ay, yo, I'm just like my country

Woah, woah, woah (Ayy)
Woah (Woo)
Woah (Say, let 'em hear ya)
Yeah (Let's go)

Woah, woah, woah (I said, shout it to the rooftops)
Woah (Said, to the rooftops)
Woah (A-come on)
Yeah (Come on, let's go)

Rise up
When you're livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Woah, woah, woah)
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Woah)
When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Woah)
Rise up

I imagine death so much, it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from, some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' and fightin'
I've been readin' and writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation
I'm laughing in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

And I am not throwin' away my shot
I am not throwin' away my shot
Ay, yo, I'm just like my country

The Reynolds 

We have the check stubs from separate accounts

Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts

To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in 1791

Is that what you have? Are you done?
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

Though virtue is not a word I'd apply to this situation

To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission
You might also like
And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation

An immigrant embezzling our government funds

I can almost see the headline, your career is done

I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from

Ha! You don't even know what you’re asking me to confess

Confess

You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless

Unless
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

No one else was in the room where it happened

Is that a yes?

Um, yes
"Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to"

What?!
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee, I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly
As you can see, I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list and see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see, I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?
My God

Gentlemen, let's go

So?

The people won't know what we know

Burr
How do I know you won't use this against me the next time we go toe to toe?

Alexander, rumors only grow
And we both know what we
