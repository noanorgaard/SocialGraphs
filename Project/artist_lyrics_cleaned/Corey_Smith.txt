Thursdays came and the pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern, we'd pay a nickel for every beer
Shootin' pool, smokin' cigarettes with a dizzy head and a grin
At 4 AM on a school night, still hangin' out with my friends
One hour's sleep on a dirty couch, no shower, off to school
Smellin' just like a brewery with a bad hangover too
The teachers all would hassle me, "Stay awake, pay attention"
I was catchin' hell, wishin' I was twenty-one

The youngest one of all my friends, I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecomin' parades
Now I look back and I have to smile 'cause, boy, it was fun
Bein' seventeen, wishin' I was twenty-one

And now I'm only twenty-six, feeling more like forty-three
My hairline's disappearing and I never get ID'd
My clothes are out of fashion, no, I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o'clock each night and up at half-past four
Still, I go down to that college town when the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can 'til the whole damn thing is gone
Then I look at all those college girls, so innocent and young
And I just check 'em out and say, "Damn, I wish I was 
1 ContributorF*** The Po Po Lyrics
Blue lights flashing, they got traffic stopped
And Highway 11's done turned into a permanent road block
I wasn't driving, my wife was my D.D.
And she hadn't drank a drop, still got hassled by the J.P.D
And I said hey dude can't you just leave her alone
She ain't done nothin' wrong man and we just wanna go home
Woah-woah

And I was mad as hell, thinking fuck the po-po
And they wonder why folks don't trust 'em no more
Woah-hoah
And I'm not gonna let this go, and I'm singing fuck the po-po
Fuck the po-po

So I got arrested, just for speaking up
And that cop said boy the only right you have is to shut the fuck up
Now I'm a jail-bird, I've done time in the pen
And I've got a real messed up story to tell all my friends
Yeah, my name was in the newspaper in my home town
They ruined my reputation because I didn't bow down
Hell no

And now I'm mad as hell singing fuck the po-po
And they wonder why folks don't trust 'em no more
Woah-hoah
And I'm not gonna let this go and I'm singing fuck the po-po
Fuck the po-po

Two fingers in the air for the J.P.D
The long-arm of the law coming down on me
Now I understand why all these rappers are mad
They must have been treated as badly as I have
Now I'm screaming thug life, fuck the po-po
Shootin' birds out the window whenever the cops go by
They're puttin road blocks in front of my house man
Man I'm starting to feel like I live under the Taliban
Can't drive home without a gun in my face
Thursday through Sunday, they're invading my space
Tellin' me its for my sake, they're keepin' the streets safe
By gettin' all the drunks off of the highway
But I say man, that's a big fuckin' lie
It's all about the money from the D.U.I.'s
Otherwise they'd be parked out in front of this bar
Giving free breathalyzers before we get in our cars
Instead they just hide about 3 miles away
And sit and wait for one of us to make a mistake
Drink a little too much and you'll be cuffed and stuffed
And probably roughed up if you complain enough
You'll be carted off to jail, in the land of the free
Another victim of the over-zealous J.P.D
Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean disrespect
There’s a lot of good cops, who serve and protect
And they boldly put their lives on the line
To protect our rights and give us peace of mind
But for every cop who thinks his badge is a crown
This song is for you, and I'll never bow down
And I'm mad as hell singing fuck the po-po
Woah-woah
And I'm not gonna let this go so I'm singing fuck the po-po y'all
Fuck the po-po

1 ContributorHarmony Lyrics
Have you ever seen a Georgia sunset
Across the cool October sky?
You know it's like a little piece of Heaven
Hung in between the day and night
Every shade of red and blue
Born in the dyin' of the light
And I'm in the perfect balance
Eyes bright and opened wide
And in a moment all my worries fade away
Oh it all makes sense to me
That's harmony
That's harmony

A Sunday dinner at my grandma's table
She's been up cookin' since the dawn
Yeah, this family keeps on growing
Still she makes enough for everyone
There's my baby boy
Right now he's the youngest one there is
Just smilin' in my daddy's lap
So full of joy and tenderness
We forget about our troubled yesterdays
Oh it all makes sense to me
That's harmony
That's harmony

It's hard to understand
Even harder to explain
Theres a miracle a flowin'
Like holy water through our veins
And if you focus you will notice it
In everything you do
Oh listen close enough
And you can hear the harmony in you
Goin' doo doo do doo do do do

Daddy bought my first guitar and he said
"Boy you were born to play and sing"
Now I take my pen and capture
These little bits of everything
I don't want fame or fortune
I just want you to listen to my songs
In a church or this bar room
I don't care
They're all the same when the musics on
There's no doubt about what I came here to do
Oh it all makes sense to me
That's harmony
That's harmony
Yeah, yeah
There's no doubt about what I came here to do
I'm gonna play and sing for you
That's harmony
That's harmony
That's 
1 ContributorIf I Could Do It Again Lyrics
Best friends in a pickup truck, we were Panama City bound
Eight hours in the back, wind blowin' with the sun beatin' down
Makin' plans to raise some hell, celebratin' our senior year
I had a trash bag full of clothes and a suitcase full of beer
We got pulled over by the Alabama State Patrol
But they never found the booze, so they had to let us go

If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
Pass out on the beach drinkin' Golden Grain
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Then I'd go for a swim and start drinkin' again
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, yeah
Do it again

I met a girl from Tennessee, no I don't remember her name
But I can still see her top pulled down and that belly button ring
We kissed but I didn't tell, no, I had to keep it hush on the down low
I had girlfriend back at home and she didn't need to know
Sure I felt a little guilty as we dusted off our clothes
But she was wild and she was fine Lord, worth every lie I told
Aww yeah

If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
With the one night stands and the drinkin' games
You know I'd check out the girls at the clubs, hookin' up whenever I could
Sex on a beach never tasted as good
I'd break my first love's heart, forget to hide the fingernail marks
If I could do it again

I'd get sunburned on a new tattoo, lose my favorite jeans and my tennis shoes
Get kicked out of my hotel room and sleep in the truck for a night or two
Blow all my money, have to call my dad and work two months just to pay him back
Take bong hits and laugh like hell, flip the police off and get hauled to jail
If I could do it again I'd do it the same, not one regret I wouldn't change a thing

I'd check out the girls at the club, hookin' up whenever I could
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Aww yeah
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord
