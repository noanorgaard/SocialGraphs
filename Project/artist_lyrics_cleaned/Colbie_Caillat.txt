Tell me is it only me, do you feel the same?
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Baby, there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through

So can we say

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers, stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
