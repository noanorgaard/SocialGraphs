I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't found

Can you tell me when we gonna get to it
I'm tired of foolin' around I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young I say, if you really want to have fun
Go for it and when you win, say "I go for it"

I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't found

'Cause I plan to be a cool kitty

I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't 

Baby, it was uncool to love me
Then leave me standing here now without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me

I know you'll leave me once again, and take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me, yeah
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me, yeah

See, I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forevermore, whoa, whoa
