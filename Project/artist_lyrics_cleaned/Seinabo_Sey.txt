There's a conclusion to my illusion, I assure you this
There's no end to this confusion if you let it wish
You well, soul to sell, highest bidders, can't you tell
What you're getting?
There is a light to all this darkness, I will tell you this
There's redemption in you asking them just why it is
Some answers are better left unspoken
When you know you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger are you?
Younger, younger, younger are you?
You ain't getting any

Getting any
No, you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger are you?
Younger, younger, younger are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger are you?
Younger, younger, younger are you?

Why we fight to get on loving I've been wondering
How your mind will leave you hanging your heart lingering
Stay lost then found by whoever stays around forgetting
There is a way to be yourself, I assure you this
There's a way to catch your dreams without falling asleep
You might as well get it while you can, babe
Cause you know you ain't getting any

Younger, younger, younger are you?
Younger, younger, younger are you?
You ain't getting any
Younger, younger, younger are you?
Younger, younger, younger are you?
Getting any
