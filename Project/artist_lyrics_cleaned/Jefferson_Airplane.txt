Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Love, love

When the garden flowers
Baby, are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah, but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Tears are running
They're all running down your breast
And your friends, baby
They treat you like a guest

Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love



And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
He called Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your headYou might also 

Hey, people now
Smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
Love one another right now

Some will come and some will go
We shall surely pass
When the wind that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading on the grass

Hey, people now
Smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
Love one another right now

Hey, people now

If you hear the song I'm singing
You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
One key unlocks them both, you know
It's at your command

Hey, people now
Smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
Love one another right
