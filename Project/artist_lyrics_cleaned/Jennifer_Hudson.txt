Hey baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I just moved into town
I'm lost, can you show me the way, way, way?
If I can be with you, you can help me the other day, day, day
Honey, excuse me, hmm, keep on working
If I didn't know no better, I'd think that you was flirting
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear
Working on all '‘em excuses to get up in here
And boy you talking good shit
And I swear that you could get it
I'm a good girl, I gotta think about my image
Show dignity, but I'm sorry
I'm not just anybody

You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah

Hey baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Can we reschedule? We can do this another day, day, day
Fuck it, let's do this today
I know you want to, take me to your room
And I wanna go your way, way, way
But you gotta treat me like a lady
We should just get to know each other, yeah
And the man will go away-way-way
But now I'm on the first stand, yeah

You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah

I'll be on, I'll be on, I'll be, I'll be on that good shit
I'll be on, I'll be on, up that hood shit
You gotta bring me out
Let me show you how
So approach me now
If you'll do it right you can turn me out
Slow it down
I'll give it to you now
Boy, what you talking 'bout?
If you wanna guilt me, you got a word for me
Now baby get out, hey
You got me hypnotized
You got a look and a something money can't buy
Walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah
I got you hypnotized
I got the staring and from the look in your eyes
You wanna walk it out with me
Walk it out with me, walk it out with me, woah

Walk it out
Walk it out
Yeah baby
Oh
