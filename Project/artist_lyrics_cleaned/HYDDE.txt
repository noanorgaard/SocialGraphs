I can see the warning signs
I'm not here to be your crime
Show me what you hide
Show your other side, Gemini

Thought the line was grey, but it's vivid in black and white
Thought that you could change, but a penny don't make a dime
No, I paid my dues, I don’t owe you anything, did you think that I'd want more
Now I’m going on my way, cause I saw you in a different light

Cause your hands are clean, but I'm not blind
I can see the warning signs
I'm not here to be your crime
Show me what you hide
Show your other side, Gemini

I knew it from the start that you, were keepin' something heavy in your heart
And you said that it was nothing
Truth is always hard but I want you to let me in
Let me in
I knew it from the start that you were keepin' something heavy in your heart

Truth is always hard but I want you to let me in
