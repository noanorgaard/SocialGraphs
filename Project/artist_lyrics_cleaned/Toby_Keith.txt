Grand pappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak tree
Round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It’s time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and he'll settle them down
You can bet he'll set them down 'cause

And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh

Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues

Mama locked the door last night
For the first time in all of her years
I said Mama you gotta be kiddin' me
She said things ain't like they used to be 'round here
You just wouldn't believe it
Kids growin' up without Jesus
A good thing your Daddy ain't here to see this now
They stay higher than the water tower
In this thirty-five mile an hour town

She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze
I've had a back road buzz or two myself
It seems like heaven's slippin' further away
The devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell
We used to burn a hole through midnight
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and
On a good night might kill a fifth of Crown
But now there's a lower higher power
In this thirty-five mile an hour town

Oh we can't blame the babies for growin' up lazy
And crazy, it ain't them that let them down
If they ain't stealin', they're suin'
Why work when we'll give it to 'em

No one hits the front porch lights
To get their kids to come inside

Since they printed a prowler

No they're going nowhere fast tonight
No matter how fast they drive in this

For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
In 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass

Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
