She's the first in line at the party
She's the first in line at the club
And she's got that body, always gotta flaunt it
Everybody's looking up
When she walks by you want to be her
And your boyfriend pretends not to see her
'Cause she's got that fire, doesn't even try
Her booty has its own zip code
All the peasants bow down

God save the prom queen
Teenage daydream
Just another dressed up heartbreak
God save the prom queen

Turned her tears to diamonds in her crown
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Turned her tears to diamonds in her crown
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Diamonds in her crown
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

And she lives her dreams through the magazines
And her daddy's gone and she needs someone
And she's got the looks and the boys on hooks
But she'd trade it all for a heart that's whole
God save the prom queen
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
God save the prom queen
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
God save the prom queen
Teenage day dream
God save the prom queen (She turned her tears)
She turned her tears to diamonds in her
