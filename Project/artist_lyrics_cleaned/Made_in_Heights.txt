An empty glass on my right with the windows drawn
Movements light as the pillow that I dream upon
(didn't mean to get so carried away)
And my shoulders they lean on the back seat
Pursue the night like a ghost with a history
(didn't mean to get so carried away)
Call you up on my cellie just to hold me down
Tiny knots pull my belly when they come around
(didn't mean to get so carried away)
(Ha, ha, haaah...)
(Ha, ha, haaah...)
(Ha, ha, haaah...)
(Uh, uuuh...)

Keeping track, the time, and that
The scenery, time, with that, with that
Keeping track of time, with time and that
The scenery and time, time, with that
Keeping track of the time and the scenery
Shifting gears in my mind like machinery
Keeping track of the time and scenery
Shifting gears in my mind like machine-

(Ha, ha, haaah...)
(Ha, ha, haaah...)

Flying through the open door
(Ha, ha, haaah...)
Didn't mean to get so carried away
Ooh, I didn't mean to get so carried away
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh...)
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh...)
(Ooohh)
