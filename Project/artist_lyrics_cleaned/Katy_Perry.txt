All to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty heart is on steroids 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleepin' beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine (Mine)
There's no goin' back


You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnеtizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
Thеy say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Gettin' stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next, alien sex?
I'ma disrobe you then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat (Turn it up, turn it up, yeah)
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (Like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me (Oh, we're all)
We're all chained to the rhythm (Oh, we're all)
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (Chained to the rhythm)

It goes on and on and on (Turn it up, it goes)

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough

I struggle, I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it, erase it, repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath
And I save as draft

You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

I struggle, I juggle

I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

I struggle, I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie (Dogs lie)

'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill
'Cause that's the deal

If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight (Oh no)
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight (Ooh)

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
