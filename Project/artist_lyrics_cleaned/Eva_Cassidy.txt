Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you have said
And you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
You might also like
After your picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
I'm wondering if you're okay
And you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time

Time after time (Mmm)
Time after time (Ooh)
Time after time
Time after
