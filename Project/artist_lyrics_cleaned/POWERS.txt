Throwing wishes at the street
Following my feet
Looking for a moment
I was blowing with the breeze
Swinging on trapeze
Going through the motions, yeah
Oh but time, ain't got time to be waiting around
She too busy paying money and she ain't slowing down
I'm still cutting all my teeth on a faded dream
Watching it unfolding, yeah oh

Sometimes the time is worth wasting
Some heartbreaks are worth braving
I know, you know, you know

I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than nobody else

Four in the morning
She wants to dance
Trading the nighttime in her hands
We've got candy and kisses
Keeping us high
Until we make it to paradise, sing

The road to nowhere
Foot on the gas
The sun is watching
Having a laugh
So won't you hold me like the sky holds blue?
And I'll keep singing this song for you
