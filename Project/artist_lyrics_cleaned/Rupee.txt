I lose all control when I see you standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair, you flair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance and de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin' for a taste

Before the end of the night (The night)
I wanna hold you so tight (So tight)
You know I want you so much (So much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I am tempted)
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
