Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull
First you get close, then you get worried

I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

You're going silent, the silent treatment
It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant
You get excited, you get excited
You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You get excited, you get excited

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

To believe again

Fell asleep with stains
Caked deep in the knees
What a pain

Now hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Now hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the white
The whites of your eyes

All mixed up in the wash
Hot water bleeding our colors

Still things could be much worse
Natural disasters
On the evening news
Still things could be much worse
We've still got our health
My paycheck in the mail

I promised to my wife and children
I'd never touch another drink as long as I live
But even then, it sounds so soothing
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time
I'm just an honest man
Provide for me and mine
I give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations
Two weeks paid vacation
Won't heal the damage done
I need another one

To mix a gin and sink into oblivion

I promised to my wife and children
That accident left everyone a little shook up
But at the meetings I felt so empty
This will blow over in time
This will all blow over in time

What if in the end
You want so bad to forgive
But you cannot forget?

So (So tied up)
We've been here before
I'm so (So tied up)
You want something more
Lover, best friend, my worst enemy (So tied up)
You know I won't let you get away (So tied up)

I get you to swerve out of the fast lane
You still got champagne running through your veins
You dare me to step up and challenge you
Neither one of us can stand to lose, stand to lose

Washes away our sins

You threw me a rope, opposites attract
I'm self absorbed and you're superficial
We wound each other up (We wound each other up)
Being true to yourself could never be enough
(So, so, so tied up) I tried to let go

Lover, best friend, my worst enemy
You know I won't let you get away

Tell me the story of how you ended up here
I've heard it all in the hospital
Nurses are fussin'
Doctors on tour
Somewhere in India

I got one friend laying across from me
I did not choose him, he did not choose me
We've got no chance of recovery
Sharing hospital joy and misery
The joy and misery
The joy and misery
