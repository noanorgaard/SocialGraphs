Still I got one face up
I do not know how
It's not my goal to shape up
She's talking to me
I know where you've been
Back again
She's talking to me
I know what you've seen
Back again
Away
Well, she's happier now
Still I cannot face her
And I do not know how
It's not my goal to shape her
She's talking to me
I know where you've been
Back again
She's talking to me
I know where you've been
Back again
I know, been
Back again
Back again
