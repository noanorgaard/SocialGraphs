Damn, baby, that sounds sexy, uh (Shoop)

Here I go, here I go, here I go again (Again)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) Okay then
Chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop-shoop-shoop (Shoop)

If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?

Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)

Not falling in love, but I'm falling for your

Yo, Sandy, I wanna, like, taste you
Getcha, getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep (Shoop)
