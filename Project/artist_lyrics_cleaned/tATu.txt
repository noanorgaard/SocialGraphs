I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else, so we can be free
(Nobody else, so we can be free)

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума, ма)
This is not enough (All the things she said, all the things she said)

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума, ма)
This is not enough
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said
Things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said

Mother lookin' at me
Tell me, "What do you see?"
Yes, I've lost my mind
Daddy lookin' at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said (All the things she said)
This is not enough (Я сошла с ума, ма)
This is not enough
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said

Starting from here, let's make a promise
You and me, let's just be honest
We're gonna run, nothing can stop us
Even the night, that falls all around us
Soon there will be laughter and voices
Beyond the clouds, over the mountains
We'll run away on roads that are empty
Lights from the airfield (Shining upon you)

Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us (Gonna get us; not gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us (Gonna get us)

Get us
Not gonna get us

We'll run away, keep everything simple
Night will come down, our guardian angel
We rush ahead, the crossroads are empty
Our spirits rise, they're not gonna get us
My love for you, always forever
Just you and me, all else is nothing
Not going back, not going back there
They don't understand, they don't understand us
(Don't understand us, understand us, understand us)

Not gonna get us (Gonna get us, gonna get us, gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Gonna get us, gonna get us, gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Gonna get us, gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us, not gonna get us

Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us (Gonna get us; Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Gonna get us; Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Gonna get us, gonna get us)
