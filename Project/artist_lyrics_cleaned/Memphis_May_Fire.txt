How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do, what you created me to do

Well really I'm so thankful for the people I meet, the places I've been and the things I've seen
But when she's not here it doesn't feel like I'm living my dreams
I know they say, that no one is perfect, but I swear she's perfect for me
And that makes it so much harder to leave

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do what you created me to do

I need you to show me how to change the inside of me
For my heart, for their sake, please be strong, be strong for me

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, so alone
How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do what you created me to 

Gave you all I had

Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
