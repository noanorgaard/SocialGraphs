It's four AM, you're calling again
So why can't we be friends?
The cycle never ends, oh oh
And I can taste the alcohol
Knowing that you don't care at all
Telling me that you're still in love
That's when I say goodbye
But I hate goodbyes
Always seem to take you by surprise
'Cause people coming in and out your life
Never get the chance to realize
It's way too cold for mid-July
Chilling by myself and getting high
Don't know why I feel so low, woah-oh-woah
You hurt me more than you could know

Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading
Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading

Girl, you got me fading, yeah, I ain't even playing
I know that I'd be drunk and probably shouldn't say this
But I don't love you no more
It felt so good when I closed that door
I never knew that we'd get this far
I never knew that it'd be this hard
But everything it has to fall apart

Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading
Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading


Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading, fading
Baby, you drive me crazy
The only thing I think about lately
Is how I'm slowly fading, fading,
