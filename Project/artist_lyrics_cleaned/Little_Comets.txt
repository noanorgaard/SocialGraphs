St. Paul's for context
Oxbridge for vision
No need to make this popular
One man for progress
One man for past tense

Not a funnel but a wide line
Need to youth as Gove to tact
One million faces
That are staring straight past
A mix of ignorance and fission, fission

One man for progress
One man for past tense
One man for vision
No need to make this popular

Of your Old Boys club
Sooner depart than see the ascension
Of the Bullingdon
Because I want to
Make a break through
A tired addendum to working hard
I'd rather starve than become a member
