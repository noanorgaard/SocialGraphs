You're dead to me, rest in peace
You can't let me be

If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey, I'll see you never
See you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey, I'll see you never
See you never, I'll see you never
I'll see you never hey, I'll see you never
You might also like
I know you're nothing but an enemy
You've been tripping on a brand new way
I got your fake identity
And I go, if I go back
Spend your money on a Ma Tai
And then you sipping on a French rose
I've been saving for a city wide
I'll give you awful way

You're dead to me, R.I.P
You can't let me be

If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never
See you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never

Good riddance
I mean I'm really gonna miss you, though
Good riddance
I mean it's oh so sad to see you go
If you wanna throw shade
I'm gonna throw you away
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you, I'll see you
I'll see you never throw shade
Unless I throw you away, no
If you wanna throw shade
Well honey I'll see you never
See you never, I'll see you
