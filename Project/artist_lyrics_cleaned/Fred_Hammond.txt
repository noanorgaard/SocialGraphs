Life's not always down you see, ay
If the sun refuse to shine and all your skies are gray
Just sing this simple melody, yeah
And I feel good and I know it don't hate me if I show it
The joy I feel on the inside will show up on the outside
My hands go up and I praise Him
You know I'm gonna thank Him
The happiness in my life, today it won't be denied
And I feel good, good, good
Now I realize there will be days we will feel down and blue
But that's not gon' be today, ay
If you take the time to pray for me, I'll pray for you
And we lift our voice and say
And I feel good and I know it, don't hate me if I show it
The joy I feel on the inside will show up on the outside
My hands go up and I praise Him, you know I'm gonna thank Him
The happiness in my life, today it won't be denied
I choose to feel love, I choose to feel peace, a peace of mind
I know that these things are promised to me
I will wear a smile and that's just how it will be
'Cause I'm with the Son and He set me free
