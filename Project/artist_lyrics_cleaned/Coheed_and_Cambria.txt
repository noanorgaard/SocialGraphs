(Hey, hey) If it was up to me
I would've figured you out
Way before the year clocked out
Oh, I hope you're waiting
(Hey, hey) If it was up to me
I would've never walked out
So until the sun burns out
Oh, I hope you're waiting

Would we have lived as a child would care?
With this vial to drink, I dare
Only to cry all alone with your taste on tongue
(Oh, where have you been? Oh, where have you been?)
(Oh, where have you been if it hurts to be forgiving? Bye)
Should we try this again, with hope? (Bye, bye)
Or is it lost? Give up the ghost
And should I die, all alone, as I knew I would?
(Then burn in hell, young sinner)

Oh, I hope you're waiting
Yo, I hope you're waiting

Now listen well, will you marry me? (Not now, boy)
And are you well in the suffering?
(You've been) The most gracious of hosts
You may be invited, girl, but you're not coming in
