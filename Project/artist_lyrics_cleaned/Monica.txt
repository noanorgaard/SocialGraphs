It's just one of dem days when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of dem days when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of dem days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby, trust me please

Just one of dem days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't wanna take it out on you
Just one of dem days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal

I sit and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really wanna be with you the whole way through
'Cause the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back mood to mood, it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love?
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me, boy
So baby, don't you leave

Just one of dem days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't wanna take it out on you
Just one of dem days

Is a damn good liar (Liar)
But it ain't worth the pain

But you don't play with my heart

You wouldn't got caught up
