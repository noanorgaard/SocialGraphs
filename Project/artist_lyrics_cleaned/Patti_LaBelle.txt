If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you

I dream of moments we share
But you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy
Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I been going through

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you

About the changes I been going through

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you

I say you don't know how much I need
