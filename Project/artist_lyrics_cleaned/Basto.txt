Giving everything I have to see
It's more personal to make it a relatable vibe
Relax nah me never ease back
Please let me, do what the fuck that I gotta do
One time get a line refine what my mood
You could say that I'm a smooth young poet
Can't lose I know it
I could try to differentiate the love and the hate
The real and the fake
But either way I'm lost in a daze
I've been accoupled
Not accustomed to comin' up with apologies
The policy is prophecy the way that I like it
I'm on a whole 'nother train of thought
For my peace, no sleep, can't breathe
Make 'em cease I mean make 'em fiend for the feel
'Til the cup runneth over, devoted to my art
The heart, I can't find it
A fault to the man, I do this with no help
I done built it from the ground
I'm expectin' a couple losses
I'm mostly silent, don't approach me dawg
And I refuse to trust a random such-n-such
There's no sabotage and everything is on the up-n-up
It's all work, no luck, they don't get it
Live my life inside the image I presented to y'all
There's no mistake within the goals 'cause I know what I want
A misinterpretation and they base it off of a lie
But a fallacy is somethin' I would never supply
I try to keep it all together, but the evils divide
I needed somebody to speak with, I'm talkin' to God
A conversation that contains the kindness and love that I really need

Homie I just wanna find a way
'Cause I have lost the will, I can't maintain through the madness
Minimize the negativity inside of my soul
A cinematic type of picture from a vigorous mind
But call it veni, vidi, vici I defeated a curse
Worse off than I was, I cannot do this shit alone
I sacrificed my happiness in the hopes that I can receive
A return on the time that I gave to this
It is immeasurable, I know he counted the hours
I constantly work as I search
But I'm certain I've seen the signs
Tellin' me that I am headed in the wrong direction
Down the one-way, duckin' and dodgin' through the traffic
I swerve and I merged, immersed in my pity
But the only thing I pray is that people never forget me
And accept me for the man that I am
Gotta make 'em understand that I'm playing my position irregardless
I take my tone and mix that with emotion
Let's make it original
I been that bastard they never seen
A descendant of slaves that were hangin' from sycamores
Swift with the swing as the wind starts the breeze
The blood that drip down on the leaves that still blossom a strange fruit
See the evil that man do
There's no one left to save you
Try to run and hide, I hope you find a haven
Better way to heaven
Heavy heart you carry can't be healthy for you, gotta move on

I've been exposed, lost on the path that I chose
Lost on the path that I chose
I've been exposed, lost on the path that I chose
Lost on the path that I - Lawd!

Try to make a point lemme explain
My style is not to be categorized
I don't have infinite time
I'm gettin' older by the second
I reckon if I'd have stayed in college and never dropped out
Would I be happier than what I am now?
Instead I'm broke, livin' with my hands out like a charity case
I'm in a marathon, nigga it's a hell of a race
I can't keep the pace
So imma try to keep the faith that I can actually attain
Everything I ever wanted, but I'm not talkin materials
I never really asked for much, I don't have expectations, nor reservations
Stay realistic, I just want respect for my perspective
Impressed with the thoughts I've repressed and release on the page
I could I process the pain through the pen as a vessel for anything that a nigga ever been through
