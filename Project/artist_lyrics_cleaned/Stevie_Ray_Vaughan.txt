She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah, I love my baby
My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old

She's long and lean
You mess with her
You'll see a man get mean
You might also like

She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy


Well, I love my baby
Like the finest wine
Stick with her until the end of time

She my sweet little baby

My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
