Lets take it back on these niggas Soopafly
Show em what that Eastside LBC DPG like

Do you remember Wallabies and Crocusacks
Relicts gun pellets and blue golf hats
Racing tracks freaks with bats
Its been a tight rap and the say he got capped
Your city of your corner was the center of the map
Back then we scrapped
The G's know the happs
I was only fourteen playing quarterback
Five years before I bought my first Crodusack
It just bat around a homeboys spot
Damn cuz the spot getting hot
One more fresh vest in our hood
I stole a Turkish rope with the homie no good
Squabbled with some Eses
He got what I got too
Be the nigga I was feeling suit
Back then we really didn't give a fuck about nothing
Bust a nigga's ass off just for saying a little something

Kurupt was always taught not to love a dumb bitch

At the age of seventeen not giving a shit
Then I grew up threw up

Doggpound Gangsta Crip
Gray and blue up
The gang like pounds of C4
Fun at your apartment door
We came for ya oh and all the weed
Fuckin shooting everything I see
I don't want it no more
Gas pedal on the floor

Well I was twelve raised in hell
Always had a lot of time
After school chasing girls
Skinny with a curl
Tough skills were on
Doing wrong
Playing with his bone
Still standing strong
Sanging songs
'85 was on

Fuck wit' us and get that ass bombed out
Save some smoke, for the homies from the south
This is what it's all about
It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang (Eastside!)
Sag wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs (C'mon)
Swerve through the eastside Loc, scoop up the homies (Bang, bang)
Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me
It seems like this is my only chance to get rich
Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch
Trip, bring that bomb to me
Underwater with Kokane, crackin with P-O-P
Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong
I'm faded like Cheech and Chong
Watch out for the second hand smoke

Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah
Represented mines to be a true Eastsida
Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit
Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips
No restrictions, takin' off as soon as friction
Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in
Pimp brim, khaki suit, and Stacy biscuits
And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches
Keep 'em workin' somethin' everywhere we go
Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe
West coast to the fullest, but I bang the East
Mad muthafuckin' side of that city Long Beach
So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up
And oh fo sho, I'm bouta throw the Eastside up!
And if a nigga got beef with that
That's where his ass'll be sleepin' at
Point blank, 

Once upon a time, not long ago
'Fore way before the days I was known to flow
I was shown straight love in the beach
Hugs from the freaks, even by the thugs with the heats (Uh-huh-huh)
Now it seems the whole damn hood done switched up (Damn)
Used to put our fists up, see who lip get bust
Hollin' out the set as we sweat at the hutch
Come from out of bounds, mess around, get stomped (Nigga)
So tell me, what's up wit' this L-B-C thang?
Homies hatin' homies when we on this G thang
Now peep game, it's about to be the next century
It ain't about life without penitentaries (Uh-uh)
It get to be a damn shame at times
Knowin' we the strongest when thangs combine (That's right)
Bang the .9, Dub and Insane for life
West and North side, keep brangin' it right

Let's all come together, leave that bull alone
(Long Beach, Long Beach)
I'm tired of playin' games, man, what's goin' on?

For all my homeboys from the motherfuckin' East (Eastside!)
Y'all deserve it, I'm swervin' in the Beamer now
I wish all my dead homeboys could see me now
I'm driftin', thinkin' back how it was
But all this money can't bring the homies back up (Damn)
So take it for what it was worth
From the Earth, to the dirt, we gon' do this 'til yo' head hurt
While time keeps slippin' away (Slippin' away)
Me and my niggas keep chippin' away (Chippin' away)
I remember when my nigga, Fay was locked away (Uh-huh)
We used to tell him how we dreamt about gettin' paid
And now we takin' trips while we mix Alizé
And we do this in a L-B-C kinda way (For life, for life)

Let's all come together, leave that bull alone

Let's all come together, leave that bull alone
I'm tired of playin' games, man, what's goin' on?
We all should love one another, put the guns away
And kick it with each other on this lovely day, 

It's all sowed up, in the LBC
Bitches breakin bread when they see the lil ass gee
I keeps my finga on the trigga cuz I'm down for this bangin shit
Quick to do it for the cause bitch I smash for my dogs
So don't get close to my nine
Cuz if you do you in store to see your nigga do the crime
Sirens goin off, niggas bowin down
Now you know about to rip gut fools ready to clown
Nigga fuck you bitches, and you hoes and you sluts
You tricks don't know what the fuck's up
On the eastside we ride, nigga 24 / 9
Tryin to keep my hands on somethin nigga at all times
Ready for war now that my pockets got bigger
You other fools die when I ride for my niggas
Cuss, bust, and fuss and kick up dust
What you laughin at nigga don't get your bitch ass rushed
CHORUS

As a child I was wild as fuck, and down to dump
And kept a sawed off brown to pump
And my reputation never takin time to thank
Role models, holdin bottles, as we ride and drink
Livin right and plottin how to come up off the bottom
Black stockings in our pockets and I pocket profits
Fuck a school, I tuck a tool and start steppin
First lesson, ain't no question, you gotta have protection
Sheets on the streets showin niggas defeats
And most beef don't cease 'til the trigga release
Livin hard, givin scars, gettin noise from hustlin
Slangin gangbangin run a game in musslin
Trustin nothin, sayin fuck it is the slogan
Everywhere we go we off the chronic and the potion
From the ocean to the city to the valley to the bay
Niggas on the mission for the cabbage every day
Cutthroats, gunsmoke, dope and hoes
What controls niggas souls on the streets I roll
Bold letters think the gangs where I bang is at
Saints, Cowboys, Steelers and Raider hats
Though I know we all the same no matter what we claim
If you a nigga you a nigga and that ain't gon change
We love Martin Luther King but respected Malcolm
Cuz he didn't give a fuck about the outcome
CHORUS 

I got a big bang theory my hardcore comittee
Gon rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Chronic low ridin bitches with silicon tities
(we gon bounce and ball until the wheels fall off)
I got a big bang theory my hardcore committee
Gon rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Affiliated with thousands rocked out medallions
(we gon bounce and floss until the wheels fall off)

Chest plates hit with gauges, sawed off, hauled off
Blast wit somethin and I breaks all the walls off
Fuck it, tie my flag around my mouth
Blue rag on my face, blue rag in my left pocket
Pistols screamin, unleashin pure fury
Smash, snatch the pockets and all the jewelry
Glass shattering, blastin, niggas scatterin
Scat, takin three to four to the back
I'm back motherfucker, live broadcast
Show my face, with my rag on, let me throw my hood in the air
Let me put 'bout two in the air
Let me show these motherfuckers that I don't care
It's a symphony composed of killers and armed forces
Livin for whatever it cost's, crimb bosses

Gun in hand, operation quicksand
Ain't tryin ta put the mark of the beast on my hand
I had to bless the head of a military man
Jumped into the back of the 4 door sedan
All up in the trunk was the hidden contraband
Fuck a middleman, my pistols aim directly from Iran
Looking from a third eye, I spot the hidden cam
I know what you look like, I know how you think

Cuz it's bout get known, I want the fuckin mansion pad
To heal that bitch sittin on
So, donate the fuckin cheese that you're earnin'
Rotate the fuckin weed that you're burnin'
Don't fuck with Bossy off the glam
Rollin crack , blow blocks in half

We rides on visitors and takes no prisoners
Handles all business and pay off the comissioner
Big time crime figure niggas gettin riches
20 inches whippin all we givin hittin switches
Twistin flippin chickens stickin victims if they slippin
Trippin, on the mission and my trigga finga itchin
Positioned at your dome, one twitch and it's on
No remorse or second thoughts once the clip in the chrome
This is the zone, weak niggas covers get blown
Stoned killers and gorillas want whatever you want
Shake spots with bank nots, keep the thang cocked
And leave motherfuckers stripped to tank tops
We the gang, it's our thang to mash and maintain
Gangbang slang came and ain't gon change
All out till we fall out, fuck the world
DoggHouse style with the chucks and curls
I got a big bang theory my hardcore comittee
Gon rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Chronic low ridin bitches with silicon tities

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend ain't knowin

Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like "Watts up trick" you know how it goes

And I was lookin fabulous
So I, got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin

Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I spot
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin
Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get hand-me-down clothes from joe cool
A couple of Dickies, with some croaker sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
Eatin' baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside of the beach, westside of the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin' with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin' dice on our knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up, is livin life in the ghetto


It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga Coolio

Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryna spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm comin' from — it's still Eastside 'til I die
Why ask why?

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

(It's a Doggy Dogg World)
Oh
Well, if you give me ten bitches, then I'll fuck all ten
See my homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One-two, three — you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin' out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on
I’m head huntin', hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you? You fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog
Ooh (Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma, my)
It's a Doggy Dogg World (It's your world)
The Dogg's World (It's your world)

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
Uh-huh, 'til when? (Till the early morn')
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit for the
Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope shit

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with the fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out ("Bitches ain't shit")
Now, I'm the mack daddy, had he
Not known about the city where I'm from, dum-diddy-dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangster clique
Now as Tha Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high

Will it ever stop?
It's like askin' "Who is it?" before a nigga even knock
The game is here to stay?
And I'm here to change the rules 'cause I'm a player that loves to play
Did you thank the Lord today?

Let a homie get his sang on, instead of his bang on

My life's my friends
And it's gonna be here till the end

Out the hood, so I know it's gonna last
Down by the sea
