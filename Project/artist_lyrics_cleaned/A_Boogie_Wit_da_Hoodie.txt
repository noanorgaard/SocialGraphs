What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches, had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club, throwing twenties like "I'll be okay"
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
They look at me now, bitch I'm drownin'
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see twelve
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got three mil', sittin' in my email
So much on me, they second guessin' what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had thirty on me
What the fuck I look like with less than thirty on me, nigga?
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?

Brought the MAC out, niggas sat down
I got shit I never had now, I could brag now
Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now I'm sittin' in the club in a different bag now
Baby when I pick it up you gon' put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the DJ turn it up, what the fuck is that sound?
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When I pull up, it go skrrt-skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know wassup, baby, this is my shit (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)

They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F, can't put water over blood, nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know what's up baby this is my shit (This is my shit)
