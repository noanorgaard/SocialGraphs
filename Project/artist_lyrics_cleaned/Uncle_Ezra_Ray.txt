We nailed a 2x12 to the back of the grill
Bought a keg that matched the bar
We got a little disco ball there hanging in a pine tree
Spotlighting up the yard
Yesterday, we sent a tweet out, "everybody come out"
"Yeah, we'll have some "Love Shack" bumping on an 8-track"
Wanna get some homegirls spilling out a Cadillac
Popping up an ice-cold 40 in a brown sack

Can I get a "hey, hey?" Can I get a "what, what?"
Can I get a "hell yeah?" Raising up a cup, cup
Say highty-tighty, good God Almighty
We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party
Beep, beep, moving in a truck, truck
Gets me thinking "uh-huh, we should back it up, up"
Hey la-dee, la-dee, splash of Bacardi
B.Y.H.B.: bring your hot body
(We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party)
(We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party)
Hey highty-tighty, splash of Bacardi
We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party

It's like we got our own Cancun, minus sand dunes
Filling up the living room to the top
We don't need no Cristal, y'all, cause we're having a ball
Drinking wine straight out the box
Well, she gets hard to handle, light a Roman candle
Try to make a spark fly, fix her up a Mai Tai
Spend 'em a tie-dye T-shirt, working those blurred eyes
She's got you thinking "oh, my my"

Can I get a "hey, hey?" Can I get a "what, what?"
Can I get a "hell yeah?" Raising up a cup, cup
Say highty-tighty, good God Almighty
We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party
Beep, beep, moving in a truck, truck
Gets me thinking "uh-huh, we should back it up, up"

Hey highty-tighty, splash of Bacardi
We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party

Can I get a "hey, hey?" Can I get a "what, what?"
All night, all night I get lovestruck
Hey highty-tighty, good God Almighty
(We gots, we gots, yeah, we gots the party)
Can I get a "hey, hey?" Can I get a "what, what?"
Can I get a "hell yeah?" Raising up a cup, cup
