The radio, and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go

But, oh, my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way

In time the Rockies may tumble
Gibraltar may crumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love is here
To stay

This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me, oh, oh, oh
I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me, oh, ho

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes, it will now

You brought a lot of sunshine in to my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one, can take the place of you
This will be you and me
Yes, siree
Eternally
Hugging and squeezing
And kissing and pleasing
Together forever through rain or whatever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you and me
So long as I'm living true love, I'll be giving
To you, I'll be serving
'Cause you're so deserving
Hey, you're so deserving
You're so deserving, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
