We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten
Island too
It's lovely going through
The zoo
It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro
And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-
Ding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy!
You might also like
We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wild
And starve together dear
In Childs
We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul
And "My Fair Lady"
Is a terrific show they say
We both may see it close
Some day
The city's glamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of 

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
You might also like
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Leave the worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever may be
You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
You'll dream, dream a little dream of
