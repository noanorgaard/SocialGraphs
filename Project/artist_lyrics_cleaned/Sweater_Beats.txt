Guys, I made this beat
Yeah

Fuck Chyrism, that shit was stupid
Fuck all the past shit, that shit stupid
Fuck GD 'cause that shit stupid
All the time, I think that bitch is stupid
Stop yelling
Every time I think I'm better, she will hit me with more letters
Callin' me, like, bitch, whatever
Fuck you, bitch, you can keep my sweater
This beat make me feel sublime, you in the back of my mind
You think you a ten? Then you are blind
We should end all humankind
If I die, it all comes with me
Chyrism, it all dies with me
I won't let that bitch come near me
Fuck that bitch 'causе she a pick-me
I don't want you on my mind
Fuck you, bitch, you past your prime
Whеn you were here, you had your time
You wasted it all, shut up, stop lyin'
Sometimes, yeah, I feel like dyin'

Verse1
You died when i was six month's old
And yet your story was untold
You left ma momma so cold
She gat no one else to hold
She cried on me her baby boo
I gat questions in ma soul
Like what happened?
When did it happened?
I don't trust these souls
You might also like
Gat a feeling in ma heart
Better put it on the beat
Swear it's  gon' be lit
On shock , on shock
And i wanna be rich
Still thinkng for the trick
From thе cradle, From the hitch
On boss , On boss
And imma keep it real
All i wanna bе is me
WapBlack king street
On broke , On broke
I'm a man,Ain't a kid
Pop molly,Pop weed
Ain't strong,Ain't weak
On smoke , On smoke
And your family just hate me
For the things that you gave me
I know they dont want me
We are enemies now
They wanna take what's mine
And the house that you gave me
Thanks be to the lord
'Coz your wife is so strong
Only thing they can't take
Is the knowledge ma gave me
Only thing that can save me
Coz i live till now
Your Momma neva loved me
All they think about is money
Fuck them
They don't help me
They were happy that your gone
All they plan is to kill me
The wanna defeat me
Wanna be
Fuck them coz I'm still moving on
I've been through court
Coz of this shit bro
Dissing,Talkng about more
I feel like king kong
I sent one into prison
He a treason , For no reason
Chameleon of the season
He had shit to learn
As your first born
I was raised so strong
I'm broke that you gone
But i keep moving on

Chorus 
It's a long way
A long way home
On the path infront of me
I've been going endlessly for us
It's a long way
A long way home
You run where the shooting stars
It's been no matter where you are
I'm  always there with you
Yeaaaah
I'm  always there with you

Verse 2
WapBlack is the king
Is the king of the street
'Lot of Niggas wanna be
They wanna be me
Fuck them
Fuck haters
You know nothing about me
I'm healthy not rich
But i live like a king
That's good,That's real
Yeah imma keep it lit
And momma i love you
I just keep it real
And i come too hard
Better tell Nasty C
Coz I'm the rap king
An African king
I do this shit for momma and ma bro
I don't care if you like me or not
Probably take a note
Live ma life for show
An African goat
You can look at ma flow
It's not like before
It's never gets old
Thanks to the lord
Im an African boy
I hit it and go
Never seen before
Don't do it for the hoes
Done did it before
Chorus 
It's a long way
A long way home
On the path infront of me
I've been going endlessly for us
It's a long way
A long way home
You run where the shooting stars
It's been no matter where you are
I'm  always there with you
Yeeeaaaah , yeeeaaah
I'm  always there with you

Verse 3 
I wish i could bring you back
I wish you could show me all the love (all the love)
I wish i could feel how it's feels to have a daddy's like(daddy's like)
And i wish you could hold me tight
Guess that we so , we so bright
Like the stars in the night
Love you Dad
See you in paradise

Chorus  
It's a long way
A long way home
On the path infront of me
I've been going endlessly for us
It's a long way
A long way home
You run where the shooting stars
It's been no matter where you are
I'm  always there with you
Yeeeaaaah , yeeeaaah
I'm  always there with you
