It will get better, better
It will get better, better
It will get better
God is in control

Find your praise within your heart
Hold it close
Don't ever depart
It gets cold in the night
But you'll be alright

It will get better, better
It will get better, better
It will get better
God is in control

Whatever state I find myself in
I learned how to be secure
Knowing that God
Will supply all my needs
And He'll work things out for my good
