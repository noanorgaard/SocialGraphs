I-I-I-I got a fast pass to the front of the line
And I'm rolling out with some friends of mine
I got the Midas Touch wherever I go
It's gold, it's gold
Yeah, wherever I go

I'll let it out tonight
Pour another shot of whatever you like
Can't feel better than this
If I play the lottery, I'll probably win

I'm on a roll, I'm hittin' every every green light
I'm on a roll, I couldn't lose a hand if I tried
I'm on a roll, my ex wants sex tonight
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll (I must be doing somethin' right)
I'm gonna live tonight like it's the best night of my life
Like it's the best night of my life
(I'm on a roll) Like it's the best night of my life (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll

L-l-life's good, you know I ain't gonna lie
I'm gonna light it up like the Fourth of July
If I can keep it up, I ain't sleeping tonight
'Cause up 'til now, it's been a hell of a ride

I'll let it out tonight
Pour another shot of whatever you like
Can't feel better than this
If I play the lottery, I'll probably win

I'm on a roll, I'm hittin' every every green light
I'm on a roll, I couldn't lose a hand if I tried
I'm on a roll, my ex wants sex tonight
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll (I must be doing somethin' right)
I'm gonna live tonight like it's the best night of my life (Ohh)
Like it's the best night of my life
(I'm on a roll) Like it's the best night of my life
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll
I'm gonna live tonight like...
Like, like, like

The best
Let's get this party vibin' (Like) (Do it)
I'm gonna roll like dice in Vegas
Say "Hi" to the world, I made it
Couldn't do it without the haters
No counts, it makes
No habla ingles
Ayy, late night
Gotta gotta fake left, gotta fix that Sprite
Ace that final, we both livin' life
Like (It's the best night)
I'll let it out tonight
Pour another shot of whatever you like

Like it's the best night of my life, of my life
Like it's the best night of my life
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll
It's the best night of my life (
