I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure, I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, an' I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one-way road
Oh, and I realise all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
Then I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
The room full of all o' my friends all dancing round and round
And I thought: Hello, new shoes, bye-bye blues

Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn
