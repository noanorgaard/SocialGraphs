Feels like my heart is only halfway beating
I'm barely breathing in, breathing out
If this is just a feeling

I'm nothing but a sinking stone on my own
I'm never gonna let you go, now that I know
Every moment without you is me just surviving

Every moment without you is me just surviving
Treading water
My arms are tired
I need you
I need you to throw me a line
I need reviving
I've been kicking, screaming, and fighting
And I wanna be alive, yeah
Every moment without you is me just
