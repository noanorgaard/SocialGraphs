Oh Mrs. Wurley where’s your son?
Is he finding his way by the stars of his gun?
Quiet and surly he walks with no shoes
He finds not a heart, nor a spade for some food

When will he give his sweet old soul the time?
To lay it down, oh lay it down
Lay it down, oh lay it down
On the mountainside, the mountainside
Where our prayers collide
On the mountainside

Sweet Mrs. Wurley what do you see
Out the old window beneath the arms of the tree?
Can you play his melody through the glass of memory?
Can you hear his whistling’ hummin’ home on the breeze?

When will he yield his wandering wheels to the signs?
When will he give his sweet old soul the time?
To lay it down, oh lay it down
Lay it down, oh lay it down
On the mountainside, on the mountainside
When will he yield his wandering wheels to the signs?
When will he give his sweet old soul the time?
To lay it down, oh lay it down
Lay it down, oh lay it down
On the mountainside, the mountainside
Lay it down, oh lay it down
Lay it down, oh lay it down
On the mountainside, the mountainside
Lay it down, oh lay it down
Lay it down, oh lay it down
On the mountainside, the mountainside
Where our prayers collide
With the mountainsideYou might also
