All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered

Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah (The holes of my sweater)
Woah, woah, woah, woah (The holes of my sweater)

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
