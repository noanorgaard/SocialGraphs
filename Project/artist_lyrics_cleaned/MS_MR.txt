The storm never came
Or it never was
Didn't know getting lost in the blue
It meant I wound up losing you

Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
Hurricane

What's wrong with me
Why not understand and see
I never saw
What you saw in me
Keep my eyes open
My lips sealed
My heart closed
And my ears peeled
You might also like
Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
Hurricane

Make ash and leave the dust behind
Lady diamond in the sky
Wild light
Glowing bright to guide me
When I fall
When I fall on tragedy

Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul, I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this, I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart
