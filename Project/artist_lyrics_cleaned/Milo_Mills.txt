Run of the mill
One of a mil
Whatever say
I can not wait
Rub it in face
Running away
Learn to not change
Been the big man
You I defend
Guard like defence
You my Garden, Eden
Every single evening
Knowing u here
I say fuck all my demons
I wait-
{Verse 1}
1 of a billion
Hundred trillion
Niggas gon say
U r so beautiful, and u have such a good face
Cannot complain
Tell me the way-
So I can stay
All in ur heart, live in its shade
Running away
Shit doesn't change
Fuck a love song
Lemme give it all
Don’t give fucks about the fuckers on the call
I swear I'll pay for it all
Them XD's ain’t how I am feeling
Fuck another motherfuckers DM
Thinking bout u like AM, PM
Laugh bout shit for no reason
You might also like{Chorus}
Feelings
Feelings
Got a nigga catching feelings
Feelings
Oh tell me what the reason
Reason
Got me sitting in like Eden
Eden
I said-   X2
{Verse 2}
Yuh
Don't
Don't wanna be a man of mystery
Wanna be the fucker made history
Taking all my niggas up wid me
Fuck what you say, don't phase me
Tired of being so motherfucking lazy
Vision was hazy
Now I got aims see
U got a fucker singing like Hasley
I swear-
I can tell sometimes I go and change
U the reason I be feeling sane
Loyalty like 6 up on the DAMN
I can wait to tell u how I feel
When u not around I feel so Ill
Tempered like I gotta pay the bills
No more time for all them fucking thrills
I can't wait to tell u how I
