(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)
You might also like
You say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?
Too many empty nights
Could make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's at home alone
Awaiting the day
That you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away
But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)
And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who loves you
(Gotta stop to love)
And no one does you better
Can't you stay forever
(Stop to love)
I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on stay
Cause that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

I love you, stop
(Stop)
Love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Got to stop to love)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
Got to stop to love
I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
(Got to stop to love)
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming 

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

When I look in your eyes, there I see
All that a love should really be
And I need you more, and more each day
Nothing can take your love away
More than-a just a dream
I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee

Starting now, right now
I believe in your love
So I'm glad to take the vow

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there, you were standing
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never, ne-ne-never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too
