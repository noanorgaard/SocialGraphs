I hope that this ain't a fairytale
I wanna lick on your mufuckin' skin
'Cause that shit be tastin' like caramel
Life without you been feeling kinda strange
Well, I see that you doin' very well, ha
You lookin' very well
I miss the way your perfume smell
I miss the way that you blowed up my line
Just to make sure that I'm feeling well
I miss the way you look in my eyes
And I swear I'm gettin' back witchu, girl
Keep on talkin' 'bout my chick on the side
She ain't fuckin' witchu, girl
Tell yo' friends that they can be wuiet
Me and you against the world
Me and you against the world

I don't give a fuck 'bout no side chick
R . Kelly ain't trapped in the closet
Girl you hot me high like a pilot
I make nothing but deposits
Nigga played and he in trouble
I need my money on the double
Gon' pop that pussy like a bubble
She diggin' me just like a shovel
I know you remember them nights
When we used to fall asleep all on the fuckin' phone
I know you remember them times
When I hit it right soon as we got fuckin' home
And although that shit wasn't right
Talking to hoes and doing you fuckin' wrong
Now I'm on my fuckin' own
Shit, I'm o my fuckin' own
Huh, I'm on my fuckin' own you know
It's the God, nah forreal, time to wake the city up
Look, she keep on calling me psycho
Her mama was there, I couldn't hit through the front
So I had to sneak through the side door
I really hate that I broke yo' lil heart
Didn't really think you would cry, though
We break up, then make up, then break up again
Shit, it was a good try, though
But, shit, its goodbye, hoe
It ain't no mufuckin' secret
Breakin' my heart up in pieces
I know the game, I should teach it
'Cause these niggas hate for no mufuckin' reason
Yeah, believe it
Whenever you go, I hate to see you leavin'
Got me regretting and grieving
I like to take my time and beat up the pussy
Don't give a fuck if my phone keep on ringin'
Damn
