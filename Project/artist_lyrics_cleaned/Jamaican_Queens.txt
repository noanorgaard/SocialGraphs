1 ContributorKids Get Away LyricsI follow you home and I borrow your phone
You keep letting all the children on your block
Keep slashing your tires
I was covered in mace
Lover, they cut up your face
Throwing up, I hit the ground ashamed
As the kids drove away
I’m annoyed by the sound that keeps leaving your mouth
And at the hospital I see your eyes staring at mine
And, as that bitch births hell inside my brain
We let the kids get away
I wanna help you to bed
And I wanna do what you said
As all the compliments go to my head
It’s disillusion again
I wanna get in your shower
And I wanna be with you now
Your face heals up and now you look like me
How unfortunately
And as I tear the fucking rubble from your face
We let the kids get away
And I see them almost every fucking day
We let the kids get awayYou might also
