So drown it in gin and lemonade
Be the water to my flame
I need this outta my head
I need it out of my way
Any day. Any day. Any day now. Any day
I simply wanna know where ya go when it rains
Sitting by the river, cursed the weather when it changed
Which ever way the wind blows
I'll be ready to fly
Which ever way the river flows
I'll be ready to swim

So drown it in gin and lemonade
Be the water to my flame
I need this outta my head
I need it out of my way
Any day. Any day. Any day now. Any day
Any day now
I will walk on my own feet
I will fortify the weakest nerves in me, replicate them, build a palace to isolate the beast
Oh how I wish you well…
I will break free… any day now
Any day
