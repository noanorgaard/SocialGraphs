Baby, baby (Ah)
Call me crazy (Ah)
'Cause I know without you, I won't be no good
When the latch on my heart comes unhooked

You should know if I don't have you
Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more
If I don't have you
I know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for
I'll tear down these walls, that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't have you

Woo (You), woo (You)
If I don't have you
Woo, woo

Lookin' at my phone, but you ain't even call
I put it in a drawer, 'cause I wanna be right next to you
If you wanna talk, baby, come on through
Before it's all done, tell me I'm your only one

It's way too late to start things over (Oh)
Can't seem to get it together

But we won't look wrong dead in the eyes (We won't look, we won't look it in the eyes)
Let's try and make it right (Right)
'Cause I don't wanna fight (Fight)
Can't see myself without you in my life (I need you in my life)
Please don't say you're done with me 'cause you're my baby!
Baby!
'Cause you know if I don't have you (Don't have you)
Rocks me to the core (Baby, baby, baby), I can't love no more
