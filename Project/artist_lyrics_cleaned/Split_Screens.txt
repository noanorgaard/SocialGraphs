Yeah, I'm in love with the streets
I spit, but I'm better known when I'm huggin' my heat
I love making dudes that think they thuggin' retreat
I spit it off top the head before you plug in a beat
You in the studio, I'm burnin' drugs in a suite
If somethin' sweet lovin' my meat, I'm buggin' a freak
I'm a star, stay screamin', "Home video"
What? You don't hear me though, huh? You gon' fear me though
I'm runnin' with Tyree, the drop Billy flow
White Widow and Henny though, AKs and semis though
I don't care if you a friend or foе, I can send you far
And believе I got more
I'm in South Oakland, no weed from up No'
Go from New York, go to New Z, back and forth
If you knew me, you'd back off before I clap on
Now cut the rap off and cut the track off

We gon' ride, to all my soldiers at war
All the hitters on my call
Fight 'til you can't fight no more
I'ma stand my ground for sure
I'ma ride 'til I die
Got the best players on my side
Never get low, we stay high
Well, can you hear my fly?
You might also like
'Cause I'm a soldier, bomb explode, blast, blow
We terrorize with a squad of horrifiers that flow
We smash shows soon as Smash show and simply steal shows
Some shows shortly see proof after the beat go
Reload, this motor-mouth rap pump-action
Lieutenant Young, SI, D get it cracking
With Double E on Y-T, that's the captain
Teach the sniper, we come to make this shit happen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, not usin' the same pattern
Abusin' my brain with faggots, loose in a bucket of saggin'
With a dog tag hangin' on my neck
Three times better, forever Smash, V-O-double F

We stomping into this game like champions 'cause we baddest
Been hoping to establish the maddest trio with a cracker
We started from scratch, tried to make a mixtape
Haters, look at us now, we the ones who making your girls' booties shake
We here now, makin' a mark of this sound
We'll show you how to get down
Rerun this track and listen to the real sound
Don't think he could try to reach me
'Cause I'm at the top, pullin' myself higher than anyone who's tryin' to be me
Believe me, I came with a pack of toys
Ready to show you how weak are you, so player, stack your boys
'Cause we gon' ride higher than anyone ever seen
My soldiers forty hands up to the sky if you looking
We gon' ride, to all my soldiers at war
All the hitters on my call
Fight 'til you can't fight no more
I'ma stand my ground for sure
I'ma ride 'til I die
Got the best players on my side
Never get low, we stay high
Well, can you hear my fly?

I'ma ride 'til I die (Yeah), this be a fight 'til the death
And we ain't stoppin' 'til ain't none of y'all left
And if you talk shit, expect something from me
You can't beat me, homie, what you think 'Smashproof' means?
Remember the name we on top of the food chain
We got Kaeson on the mix, changing the whole wave
You can try (Please don't), but it's too late, it's game over
You did what you could, homie, leave it to real soldiers
Move over, get ready, wait for my call
I'ma fight 'til I'm dead on the floor
You make me laugh, all these cats having problems to maintain
Even if the game change, I'ma still stay the same
And I'm gon' ride 'til the last breath that I take
I'ma double up on all the dirty money to make
I stand alone on my own two feet, my boy Deuce on the beat
Forever showing my love for the street,
