Hating life

Look in my eyes (hating life)
You'll see the dark
A sharpened knife (hating life)
Will set me free

No more frustrations
About all the bad shit in my life
I see no future
Don't wanna fight another day
I hate this life
So much you won't understand
I'm sick and tired
Of this downhill ride

Hating life

I hate this life
I have paid my dues
I don't see the light
So I won't stick around
I hate this life
I have paid my dues
I don't see the light
So I won't stick around


I drown in depressions
Countless addictions wear me down
Here's a confession
I'm gonna kill myself tonight
The downward spiral
An endless stream of accidents
I feel so useless
I'm better off dead

Hating life
Look in my eyes (hating life)
You'll see the dark
A sharpened knife (hating life)
Will set me free
