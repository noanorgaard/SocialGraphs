You know wassup, pour another cup
Let that liquor hold your sentence
Why you gotta talk so much?
Not tryna fuss, but I'm in a rush
See you movin' them lips but not on this so you ain't saying much
Tried to be polite, but you ain't acting right
Sit yo pretty ass on this bed, make a v-shape with your legs, that's it, that's it...

I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up

I admit it, I admit it, when I said I came to kick it
Girl I was lyin' (lyin')
I got so damn carried away, there's nothin' left that I can say
I want you now, I need you now
I gotta hit that shit somehow, somehow
I gotta hit that shit somehow, right now

I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), with you
I just wanna get fucked up
With you, with you, (oh yeah), I do
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up
Already, already, already know
I just wanna get fucked up

Girl you single tonight, heard some shit you ain't like
'Bout that nigga that was lovin' on you just the other night
You've been workin' all week, know it's hard on your feet
Let me take some of that stress up off you
Come lay with me
