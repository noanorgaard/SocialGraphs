Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us
With their lies

And I wanna walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come?

Come away with me, and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop lovin' you


And I wanna wake up with the rain
Fallin' on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with meSee Norah Jones LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also 

Like the desert waiting for the rain
Like a schoolkid waiting for the spring
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

And my poor heart, it's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all, you're the one who turns me off
But you're the only one who can turn me back on

My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

And I don't know how to slow it down
My mind's racing from chasing pirates

Now an ambulance screams
While the silliest things
(Are) flopping around in my brain
And I try not to dream
Up impossible schemes
(That) swim around, wanna drown me insane

And I don't know how to slow it down
Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates

And I said, "Hoh, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh"
To you

Surprise, surprise, couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face
Surprise, surprise, never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

And I said, "Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh

To you

Now, the night will throw its cover down
Mm, on me again
Ooh, and if I'm right, it's the only way
To bring me back

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum

I don't know why I didn't come
