Girl, I've been all over the world
Looking for you
I'm known for taking what I think I deserve
And you're overdue

And if you listen, you can hear me through the radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missin' in my life, what I been dreamin' of
You'll be that girl, you'll be that girl
You'll be

Everything you want, so let me get up there
I'm the baddest, baby, in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you'll like

You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You, you make me feel, oh
You might also like
Get a little closer to me, girl
And you'll understand
'Cause if you want a guy that knows what you need
Well, then I'm your man

And if I listen, I can hear you through my radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missin' in my life, what I been dreamin' of
You'll be that girl, you'll be that girl
You'll be

Everything you want, so let me get up there
I'm the baddest, baby, in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you'll like (Oh-oh-oh)
Everything you know, I flip it upside down
Take you around the world, you know I like it loud
Tell me what you want, 'cause we can do just what you'll like

You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel that (Oh-oh-oh)
La-la-la-la-la
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Let the lights drop, let the lights drop
Make my world stop, make my world stop

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

You make me feel that
La-la-la-la-la
You make me feel so
