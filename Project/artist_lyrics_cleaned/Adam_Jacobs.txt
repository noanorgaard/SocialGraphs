Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one man rise in crime
I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em

Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

Stop, thief
Vandal
Outrage
Scandal

Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

One jump ahead of the hoofbeats

Vandal

One hop ahead of the hump

Street rat

One trick ahead of disaster
Scoundrel

They're quick, but I'm much faster

Wish me happy landin' all I gotta do is jump
