Boy, I love it when I open my eyes
And I see you beside me, you know what I want to do
Come closer, I see you smiling
You're reading my mind that I'm ready to get it on
Don't worry, I won't hold back
Don't watch the time, we got plenty of that
Boy, the way you look underneath the sunlight
Is bringing on my appetite

Kisses for breakfast, early in the morning
Love me, touch me, keep me wanting
Kisses for breakfast, early in the morning
Tell me baby how you want 'em

Lips like honey baby, pour, pour
Ooh, that's hot, sweet to the core
You got the sugar that I'm craving for
It's the perfect way to start our day
Please don’t go, baby stay, let's play
Early in the morning I'mma give you something priceless
Come and get this loving, baby
