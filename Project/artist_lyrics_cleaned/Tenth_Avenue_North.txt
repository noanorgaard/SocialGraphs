And He'll break
Open the skies to save
Those who cry out His name
The One the wind and waves obey
Is strong enough to save you

Look, now is not too late
Lift up your head
Let the rain fall on your face
You're not far from grace
You're not too far from grace

And He'll break
Open the skies to save
Those who cry out His name
The One the wind and waves obey
Is strong enough to save you
You might also likeBreak
Open the skies to save
Those who cry out His name
The One the wind and waves obey
Is strong enough to save you

I know the weight of this world
Can take you down like gravity
And I know the current of yourself can take you out
Out to sea but hold on, hold on

And He'll break
Open the skies to save
Those who cry out His name
The One the wind and waves obey
Is strong enough to save you
Break
Open the skies to save
Those who cry out His name
The One the wind and waves obey
Is strong enough to save 

Acoustic Version (feat. Matt Maher):
As I walk this great unknown
Questions come and questions go
Was there purpose for the pain?
Did I cry these tears in vain?

I don't want to live in fear
I want to trust that You are near
Trust Your grace can be seen
In both triumph and tragedy

I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

But sometimes my faith feels thin
Like the night will never end
Will You catch every tear
Or will You just leave me here?

But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
You might also like
So, whatever happens I will not be afraid
Cause You are closer than this breath that I take
You calm the storm when I hear You call my name
I still believe that one day I'll see Your face

And I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let
