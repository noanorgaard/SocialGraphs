Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
Now, my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey, yeah

(Yeah!) Every night and day
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'Cause, girl, there's a better life for me and you
Now, my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true, yeah
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know it

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs

And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's all drunk


Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm
