This is all there is
This is all there is
This is all there is
This is all there is
Looking for a way
(a way)

This is all there is
This is all there is
This is all there is
This is all there is
This is all there is

Rainbows, rainbows, rainbows, rainbows

I feel music in your eyes
Rainbows in your kiss

I have never reached such heights
Could heaven ever be like this?
