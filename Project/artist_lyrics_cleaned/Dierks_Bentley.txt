The one that lets her know for sure
She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
Someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train

I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing

May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame
