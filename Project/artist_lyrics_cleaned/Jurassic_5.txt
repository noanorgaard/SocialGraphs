We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same
No name, use fame, strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or Redd Foxx and ripple
We pass participles, and smash the artist in you
The saga continues, this I won't get into
Cause there ain't enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

Yo...
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but ain't too much changed
We in the game yo, but not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim, I drum at your head to hit the brain
I'm labor ready, Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour

We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'

Hip-Hop music

Yo...
Well, it's the verbal Herman Munster, the word enhancer
Sick of phony mobsters controllin' the dance floor
I'm in them dark places, catch you when you stark naked
Your heart races as we pump you for your chart spaces
The tart tastes be bringing these hot styles through
Some of you bum a few cheers from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel, perform ill...

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship
You might also like
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not an expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, whatchu doin after this?)
Infactuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want just a touch
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the roo-ooo-ooom

This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm tryin to salvage a friendship

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time

Now I'ma say this one time, boy, and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear, you add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone and how the harmony's done
And the sucka emcees die before they've begun
Well, I'd like to know if you've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it, you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference, we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from countryside to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these emcees even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills, that's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the hundred-watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenants of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat, recline and take a seat

Now I walk from Tranzania, earthquake Transylvania
And on the way, I kicked a hole through the Wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause I'm schizophrenic of the pen
Wait a minute, I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats, pull out your cuts
Give us a mic (What up?), and we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sundown like picking cotton
The Nutty Professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood from New York to Compton
Me and my three sons, Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y
Do or die, anti-Illuminati, why
Do the liquid from my vocals make the ghetto start swimmin'?
Forever winning, I'm in it like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
A sucka emcee freestyle, he had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attaché
Briefcase, in this case, the victor is no way
Ah, ah, the tool spinners, cookin' a full dinner
Killin' the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy rattling your anatomy?
Gotta be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day when labels pay our way
2na, what you say when emcees come to play?
Man fi dead, 'cause we take it back like Spinal Tap
Preparing your intellect before your final nap
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees

Just got beef, huh, watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development
I'm eloquent when it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you 'url off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my shit's Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my chop suey style
'Cause I'm a lyrical chef, I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin', from here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman on Good Times
When I rhyme, I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots, 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreadin', beheadin' fools with the punishment
I live in America, but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac, my rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples, I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once, I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict strictly for my benefit
I step on toes when I flow, don't get offended
Come and get with it, comprehended when I kick it
I represent the real from the beginning to the end of
