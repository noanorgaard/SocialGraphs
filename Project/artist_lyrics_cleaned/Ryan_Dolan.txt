Yeah
I trap with my gun in the air
Made a British hoe fuck on the Lear
I might die on the jet like Aaliyah
Elevator, they takin' the stairs
Steps ahead, been that nigga for years
She want a real one, so I re-appear
Need some gel? I'ma cum in your hair
Stop right there
Do you need-need-need-need-need your edges done?
Arrogant Tae, bitch, I'll knock off your wig
You lil bitty niggas get snapped like a twig
Formerly know as the man with the stick
Slinging that wood to FKA twigs
I'm flashing my fangs, smell the blood in the air
Got animal instincts, the Tiger King here
She go Carol Baskin and feed me the-
She drunk tryna wine it low, Actavis - no merlot
Did I st-st-st-st-st-st-st-studder, hoe?
I'm spittin', I'm spittin' that hot fire, D-Dylan
Burn this bitch, down, yeah it's best to do a tuck and roll
They billin' me, billin' me, I'm keeping all the receipts
Breakin they hearts, I got Bellamy tendencies
Perc 15 killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Half-dead, and my opps too pussy to finish it
Oh-so deathless, boy chill out
Bury you in hunduns, pour the bills out
I'm like Bob talking to my tools, I'm a builder
So you know I gotta destroy all these niggas
Say you ran your sack up, but mine a lil bigger
Wait, whoa, pause, gay ass nigga
Downstairs at my momma house, packs got delivered
I was wrappin', rappin' in the basement like tigger

Bought a Lambo, cash, put a hundred K down
Fucking on the prom queen, spillin lean on her gown (Really living like that)

Got a ten-piece, split it up with my rounds
Cock my gun, put it in your bae mouth

I'm Robb Bank$, I came to get down
Yeah, I'm internationally known
And I'm known to put the culture on

Rapping with the Cartiers on, I got the vision
Y'all niggas three blind mice, need Lasik (Rats!)

Catch me out in Bandicam
I'm outside where my feelings be
Don't come in my vicinity
Only got my brothers next to me
The enemys of my enemys
And you know all my brothers keep
Err, err, I'm 'bout to die off this Perc
Resuscitate me with at least 2 more
Kie Money like Korin, Senzu Beans galore
In the tower like Goku, on a cloud with my pole
Give her 6 wishes, 1 more, gotta get the balls (Chyeah)

Make it earthquake up and down, off the RP, got me dumbfounded (Yeah)

Grab my keys, bitch, I'm pulling back round
She rock slow, she dip slow
Only dance to reggae and calypso
Get ya legs and put 'em in a figure four

My bitch on probation, we fucked in the sauna
"Sw-sw-sw-swear that you drop this tomorrow"
