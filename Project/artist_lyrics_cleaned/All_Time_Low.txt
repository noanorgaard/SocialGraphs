Right now, I think that you think that I'm
Half drunk, searching for something of
Substance, casually dropping a line, designed
To keep you next to me
I can't awkwardly craft in advance
I know that you wouldn't fall for that
You say "Shut up and take my hand"
And we carry on

I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever?
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me

Hot damn, look at me now

Mayday, situation overload
I'm restless, obsessed with your future
And all my worries they don't bother you
Collected, you render me useless

Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it, Jasey
(Say you mean it)
You're dressed to kill
I'm calling you out
(Don't waste your time on me)

Now there's an aching in my back
A stabbing pain that says I lack
The common sense and confidence
To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end
(Just say when)

Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it, Jasey

I've never told a lie
And that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet
But we gamble with desire
I've never lit a match
With intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control

Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this town
But I ditched the car and left you to
Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind

Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of crappy
What you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, you ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song, hope that you sing along
And it goes, "Merry Christmas, kiss my ass!"

I thought that for a while (A while)

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers

How you level me out sometimes

Then I would never let another day go by

Strip club in a strip mall, a million ways to die
All the things we lost in the back seat of the sky
Growing up with eyes glued shut

Wishing on a star that's just a satellite
Driving in a car with broken tail lights

We knew that we were destined to explode
And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you go

The Jager's so sweet
But if it keeps you around then I'm down

Meet me on Thames Street
I'll take you out though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce, but I'm warm enough
Because the tension's like a fire

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
