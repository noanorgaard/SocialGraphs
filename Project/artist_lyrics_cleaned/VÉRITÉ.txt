You could convince me to
Tie my hair back
Relive the years I’ve left behind
You could convince me to
Stay up all night with you
While you leave me
Underdressed and out of time

Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof
Made it
Give me just a little truth
Leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view
Change it
All I ever wanna do
Is stay here (stay, stay, stay here.)

Everything means everything
And nothing is numbing
Can’t avoid the consequence
So don’t get upset
Cause all you ever wanna do
Is take all my clothes off
Watch me make you promises
I can regret

All I ever wanna do stay
All I ever wanna do stay
All I ever wanna do
Stay 

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else

Come on, baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
Come on, baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place
Oh I don't believe that you have got it in you
Cause we are just gonna keep doin' it and every time
I start to believe in anything you're sayin'
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it
