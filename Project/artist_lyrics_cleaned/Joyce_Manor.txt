You treat it like a game of skill
But it's more like a work of art
Or money in a Christmas card
You think about it way too hard
I'm gonna stay with you until
You disappear into the crowd
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it still

Looking at your face in the dark
You don't even look that smart
I don't know what you tried to tell me
Disappear into the crowd
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it stillSee Joyce Manor LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also 

But I'm a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it
You tell 'em, "No, not this time."
I'm just a constant headache, a dead pet device
You hang me up unfinished
With the better part of me no longer mine
And then you finally found me, pretending to sleep
You said such nice things about me, I felt guilty and cheap
You took two steps to the kitchen and just stared at the sink
I couldn't hold back a smile, I still wish I could have seen
You having sex in the morning, your love was foreign to me
It made me think maybe human's not such a bad thing to be
But I just laid there in protest, entirely fucked
It's such a stubborn reminder one perfect night's not enough

It's just a constant headache, a tooth out of line
They try to make you regret it
You tell 'em, "No, not this time."
