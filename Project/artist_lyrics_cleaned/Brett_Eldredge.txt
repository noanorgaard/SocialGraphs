Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste

I'd love to run my fingers through your hair
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I needed
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass, the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain, the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
(pourin' out your heart)

When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind

Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
