I wanna be your best friend, yeah
It's so crazy, amazing
And you know it

You know I'm feelin' you, and you like it
You like it 'cause you know I'm yours
You know exactly what to do, and I like it
I like it 'cause I know I'm yours

Everybody's tellin' me I've been changin'
'Cause I ain't ever been in love before (Oh, love)
But we know what it is, yeah (Oh, yeah)
And I believe you're what I've been missing

But now I wanna call you my baby

She like my style, right? But that's to be expected
But is your mind right? Are you self-reflective?
Can you handle the limelight when you under pressure?
Like 50 said, girl, 21 questions

What's up with the head? Ooh, not to get ahead of things
Don't be shy, just back it up on me
Take your time, I like it when you slow me down
