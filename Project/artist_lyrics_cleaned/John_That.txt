My girl!?
I wish I never met her
Ah yeah right!
Know I never could forget her
I was feeling down
But she got me feeling better
So I'll twist her up in another love letter, saying
Dear gorgeous
I really missed ya?
It's been a long time
Since I kissed ya
Don't get me wrong
Cuz I never meant to diss ya
And I don't care if there's others in the polaroid picture
Click, chhh
I'll just roll another J
Thought I was feeling down
Now I'm feeling okay
I'll never love another
No ones getting in the way
Things have been different ever since you let me say that you're:
My girl
My girl, best ever
Before we first met yeah I used to say never
Cold shoulder up was my favorite method
Had me at hello
But I guess that's where she gets ya!
You might also likeSo gone getcha some
I heard she's coming round
And even when I'm broke
She helps me write my sounds
True love
Gimme just what I ask for
We blaze in every country
Got a puff puff passport

And I roll another J
Thought I was feeling down now I'm feeling okay
I'll never love another no ones getting in the way
Things have been different ever since you let me say that you're

My Girl, My Girl, My Girl
Talking 'bout My Girl
My Girl
Ooo

I'm having trouble tryna figure if I'm dreaming
I'm missing you before you leaving
Dunno how to love again
She was the reason
But since you came around boo
The only thing I'm thinking of is you
.. got me feeling like I shouldn't be feeling this feeling so soon
When we toast to da moon
Sleeping til noon
Intoxicating when you come around
I can smell ya perfume from the other room
You put a freeze on my reign of bad days
Cold piece of work
Your love got me paid
And when it's me and you
Fires in the room
We dance in the smoke
From July 'til June
As I ...
Exhale clouds of the best of you
I'm laughing at da fools who disrespected you
Feeling like I'm standing on a mountain when I'm next to you
Tryna keep my distance cuz I'm knowing that it's better to ..
Every time we make love it's like I'm dreaming
We be tea kettle steaming
Bedroom looking like a sauna heavy breathing
High off you every single time I breathe in
You are off the chain can we hang like a necklace
Act a little reckless
Party 'til breakfast
Be a lil restless
Get a lil breathless
Me and you are perfect
Based on my checklist
My girl

My Girl, My Girl, My Girl
Talking 'bout My Girl

I guess you'd say
What could make me feel this way?
You know I'm talking 'bout
Ya I'm talking 'bout my girl

And I'll roll another J
Thought I was feeling down now I'm feeling okay
I'll never love another no ones getting in the way
Things have been different ever since you let me say that you're

My Girl, My Girl, My Girl
Talking 'bout My Girl
My 

Like girls on TV
You wouldn't believe me
Couldn't find a problem
With a life that was so easy
Cocaine lines
Cooler than a kitten cuz she'd hit 'em all the time
With a Instagram filter just to make it seem brighter
Done studying but she's pullin' all nighters
Such a fast life and it's never gonna bite her
Putting back drinks so there's never a reminder
Of the void she can't fill
With double dosed pills
Just to get the feeling that she had
I bet she will
End up with another who'll discover what's the deal
Just to learn a lesson
Cuz there's nothing more real
With a sex appeal
Like oh my god unreal
Like perfect dime curves that she couldn't conceal
Like turning heads nightly could a been a career
Like but she's only a minor with a fake ID like
You might also like
She knows what she needs yeah
She's only seventeen
He's got her on lockdown
Speed dial blacked out
Know what I mean?
Yeah
She likes it in between
He's got her on lockdown
Got her on
He's got her on

Now her tongue out like Miley
Humping is a hobby
No one can control her when she's dancing with her body
Twerk to 2 Chainz
Long hair don't give a damn
Body so tight
She's the type that you'd give a gram
In the love club
Doing club drugs
Poland spring bottle with Bacardi filled up
Cigarette smoking
And ya bet she toke up
Thank the Lord
That we ever broke up
She was so damn fly
A sky with no limits
Things were much better from a view with no ceilings
Such a go-getter how'd she get less appealing
All the hearts broke
From the deck she's been dealing
And I know
That's how it goes
Sometimes you've got the reigns
Sometimes you're on the rope
Sometimes you find it all
Sometimes you lose control
Sometimes you slow down
Sometimes you let it roll, roll, roll

She knows what she needs yeah
She's only seventeen
He's got her on lockdown
Speed dial go blacked out
(*Phone dialing*)
Know what I mean? Yeah
(*Phone ringing*)
She likes it in between
He's got her on lockdown
Got her on (on on on on on on)
She knows what she needs yeah  (He's got her on)
She's only seventeen
He's got her on lockdown
Speed dial blacked out
Know what I mean? Yeah
She likes it in between
I got her on lockdown
Got her on
I'm sorry but the person you called has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet
Got her on
Goodbye
Yeah yeah yeah
I got her on
I got her
