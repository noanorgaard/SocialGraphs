She bad
Li'l momma she bad
And I can see that she lurkin'
And she a yellow bone, get it on her own
Been livin' all alone, li'l momma got a purpose
Stand up
She gotta work though
Watch her body and maneuver, I'ma lurk though
I send her sex texts flicks in the lab
The other was a video, rubbin' on her ass
Told her "It's all yours, you can come through"
The Fashion Nova jeans imma undo
I put her on the team, girl you fuckin' wit' a go-getter
Them other niggas try to holla but she know better
And you deserve it, tease me
I'm lickin' on your body, have you screamin'
And you can get it anywhere you wanna go
And tell the whole world, don’t gotta keep it on the low

It can all be yours, if you want it to be
So how hard is you gonna work for it?
You gotta work for it
All be yours, if you want it to be
So how hard is you gonna work for it?
You gotta work for it

Through your jeans (hrrrah)

Through your clothes, I got you tingling
Now you're thinkin' "This life is but a dream"
Humpin' carpet inside of my three-point-three mil'
Already shakin' and she won't be still
I know exactly what she feel
Take the jeans off of me, but her booty make it not easily peeled, got it
I could supply it better than Sally's
Capital Grille, Fleming's, Eddie V's, Marina Grog and Galleys
Diamond pieces like wowee!
Screamin' loudly, as I'm penetratin' we hella rowdy
Controllin the mind, servin' ya wine that's hella fine
Havin' a wonderful time, that's by design
I want you for mine, you can be my partner in crime
You can shine with your centipede spine on my nine

It can all be yours, if you want it to be
So how hard is you gonna work for it?
You gotta work for it
All be yours if you want it to be
So how hard is you gonna work for it?
