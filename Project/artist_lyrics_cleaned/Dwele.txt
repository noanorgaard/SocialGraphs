(You're so beautiful)
More than a man could ever want, girl
(Got me looking for)
Cameras to see if I'm being punk'd
(Trying to take it slow)
Ain't no sense in lying to you or to myself

I know it's early, I know it's soon
But truth be told, I, I think I love you
It's unexpected, (so) out of the blue
(But I) gotta let you know, (that I) I think I love you

The way you touch me, the way you look at me
Everything about you is so, so sexy
You do your own thing, got your own money
Everything about you is so damn
You're so damn beautiful
