You said you dont know me, fine
We knew that we'd spend the night
You said you don't know me, fine
I was alone
I was alone
You said she lost her mind
Your friends they don't like me, fine
We knew that we'd spend the night
You said you don't know me, right
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes
I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love with you
I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love
I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love with you
I know you wanted to
I think I'm, I think I'm in love
I knew I was right this time
He thought that was no surprise
Said that, that I'm on your mind
You said that you knew me fine
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love
I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love with you
I know you wanted to

I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love with you
I know you wanted to

I know you wanted to
I think I'm in love with you
