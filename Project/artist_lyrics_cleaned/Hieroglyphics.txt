Yo there is no escape
No recourse when I resort to forces of sorts reserved for bloodsports
Swerve up on a curb
Smash the sheriff
Hop out with words
Leave him unnerved
Blast a burner in your general vicinity
Pin it on your proximity I'm sending these to rock endlessly
Check your posture
Posthumously your props had you propped up
Now you're being autopsed and chopped up
You might also like
Knocked off and awestruck
With a touch of destruction
Catch a southpaw punch  when I step in the function
Fluctuating and punctuating you punks with one puncture
Making you unsure what you front for
Pep Love
Fire water wizard with an exquisite, explicit exhibit of my entire arsenal
Artful and thoughtful, awful and treacherous regiment catching 'em
Off guard when I stretch and bend 
Blend with my kin 
Put my work in 
Keep the party perkin', make a new friend
Chill with the children
Family and humanity, can it be an illusion?

 Hieroglyphics yeah
 To the kick
 And the snare like that!
 There!
 Yeah!
 We keep it raw
 Rare!
 That's my nigga!
 That's my nigga there
 Hands in the air!

Yo it's the redefinition of clever, the hot stepper
Mic checker, chin checker, bitch  checker
You beat me? Man, whatever
I'll battle you wherever whenever
Rattle you in every endeavor
I
Just get better and better
A vegan and I never wear leather
But still a cannibal
Flying high like a human cannonball
Up up and away while I'm puffin' a jay
All that gas up in your tank, you're gonna make a fucking mistake
Clutch the snake by the fat of his neck behind his jaws
Find a soft spot
Sink my venom and render it into him
Any and every enemy entering in the interim finna get
Finished to they last flimsy filament
They all feelin' it!
Militant
Resident of Oz, innocent so save
Your soft sentiments for somebody who give a shit
I
Rack your body with concussive attacks
Leaving divots and dents
The methods with which my tone pivot and shift
Are sufficient to those with
Our sedition in small doses
But it's still explosive
Uh
I apply a fly variety of my replies
Getting cooperative on a privatized
Droppin' this hip hop in this modern day metropolis
Optimistic mystic thoughts in the midst of the mouth of madness
Belly of the beast and blasphemous
Acts of massive disastrous
Diverging in masses
Clashing classes emerging and we urging revolution
Vast social change
I bring coastal rains, smoke and flame
Spoken, to invoke my pain
And put it to song
I'm sure-footed and strong
Pep steps in increments to jet set
An exception to the mediocrity
Monotony and hypocrisy, that hip hop is weak
Continuing through the darkness, holding the light
Molding my soldiers right when I'm holding the mic
