1 ContributorOn The Floor LyricsWell, I can't stand you lying here on the floor
But then again, I've asked you to move before
And you haven't
I tried to get out of my apartment door
And you were blocking my way
Passed out from the night before
I had to carry my suitcase over you
As you lay in your manger there
Passed out in a pool of drool and despair
I said, I can't stand you lying here on the floor
But then again, I've asked you to move before
And you haven't
When I came home, you were talking about the sun
How it circles in a dance of its own
And talking to it on the phone
About how the moon is a drop of Earth
Covered in thousands of lakes
And we both swim in them, escaping our darkness and hate
Looking for love, we go searching for it
We go looking for love, we go searching for it
