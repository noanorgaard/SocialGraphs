But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see it through
But all that time is gone, no more fearing control
I'm ready for the both of us now
