How do you fall in love?
Harder than a bullet could hit ya?
How do we fall apart?
Faster than a hairpin trigger

Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, will it make me a sinner?
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Don't say, don't you say it

So shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver
Holy hands, will it make me a sinner?
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
Choke this love 'til the veins start to shiver
One last breath 'til the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river, sh-
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby, stand and deliver (Like a river, like a river)

You caught my truth in the worst way
Through the dirty lens of a broken smile
And I swear I'm not a pretender
Sometimes it's love who's the biggest liar
So I'll keep on damning the Devil
And you'll keep on saying it's all right
Oh glory, I'm a believer
Oh Lord, I'm holding tight, but
