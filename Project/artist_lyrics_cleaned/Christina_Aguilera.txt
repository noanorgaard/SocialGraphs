Noel Gruber, born March 5th, Pisces. Sign of passion. Favorite ride, the Ferris Wheel
Very early on in Noel's life, his mother realized two things. The second, was his pension for all things nihilistic. While other children acted out Harry Potter, Noel acted out French new wave cinema
In grade 7, in the St. Cassian Christmas nativity pageant, Noel was suspended for suddenly breaking into this exert from 'Waiting for Gedo'

Thеre is no room in this in, for it is Christmas!
Shall we hang ourselvеs?

I hear it gives you an erection

Then we must hang ourselves, immediately!

Or we could just go to the manger, Joseph...

Aspiring iconoclast, efant terrible. Noel Gruber, the most romantic boy in town

I've seen the movie, the Blue Angel, about.. a billion and one times. If there's something better on this earth than Marlana Dittrich playing Lola-lola, the heartless booze-hound harlet, I don't even wanna hear about it
I tried to go as her every Halloween, always chickened out. And I'd go as something like... C3PO. But in my heart, I was Lola-lola dressed up as C3PO, and that was always my Halloween costume subtext!
Mom tells me I gotta try to.. blend in. So I try really hard to dial it back.. I had to.. we lived in a town where every year on July 11th when 7/11 gives out free slurpies, it's like the major cultural event of the year. I'm not even making a joke right now, it's like a Slurpee Woodstock
I was born in the wrong town! The wrong country, the-the wrong era! I wanted to **feel** goddamn it. I wanted, bad love! I wanted a man that would drive me to **drink**! I wanted to wake up in an alley way in my own vomit missing teeth! I wanted to drink myself to death on the cup of life!

(PICTURE OF NOEL IN A TACO BELL UNIFORM)

What's that?

I was hoping you could tell me

Well I.. I worked at the Taco Bell on the food court of the Mega Mall just outside Uranium City. I had to work somewhere, we had no money. I was saving up to move to France!
They named a meal after your passing. "The Noel Gruber Hungry Ombre Meal" They catered your funeral for free

Ugh!

They even played Christian Aguilera's "Beautiful"

Ugh!

On the bagpipes

UGH!
I only said I liked that song once! Ironically! Joke was my final song.. All of those wasted hours at a horrible mall dreaming of all-

I feel this is a perfect occasion to sing about "Affordable Mexican Cuisine" cue the Mariachi band

I don't wanna sing about that!
Oh if he doesn't wanna sing, I will, I will!

GODDAMNIT! Can you keep it in your pants for one second, you horrible succubus?
Fine. In my life, I was Noel Gruber who worked at Taco Bell in Uranium's City Saskatchewan. But.. In my dreams.. I played a different role.. I was Monique Chabaeu in post-war, France

A hooker with a heart of black charcoal
I write poems to burn by firelight
Drink champagne and guzzle gin
A good girls call me the 'town bicycle'
Don't knock it til' you've tried it, my life of sin
Oh, Claud, my pimp, knows never mess with me
Last prick did that faded quick to black
I have no idea where to find him officers
But if you do please mention that I'd like to have returned the pretty knife
That I stuck 10 times in his back!
(Exhales)

For I sing songs until the break of dawn
I embrace a new man every night
My life's one never ending carnival

A whirl of boozy floozy flashing light!

I.. want to be that fucked up girl!

UGH!

He said, "I think I am in love with you"
I've heard that lie a million times before
Oh, tonight I give into the fantasy
Take love when you can when you're a whore!

I embrace a new man every night
My life's one never ending carnival

A whirl of boozy floozy flashing light!

I.. want to be that fucked up girl!

So now, I sell my love for opium
In some rat-infested Chinese dive
At night, I burn myself with cigarettes
Just to somehow prove I'm still...
Alive...!

Eight months later, I catch Typhoid flu!

Ahh...

Kicked out, I see the ugly light of day
Dying in an alley, a priest kneels down to
Me...

My child, do you have any final words to the lord you'd like to say?

Oui, tell him that like him I choose to burn out! Rather than fade away...

For I sing songs until the break of dawn
I embrace a new man every night
My life's one never ending carnival

A whirl of boozy floozy flashing light!

I.. want to be that fucked up girl
Wanna be that fucked up...

Broken heart, a flask of gin
Tattooed with a safety pin

Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down"

Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
Now I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)(Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down" (Check it)
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls!

This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder! (Shout louder!)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down" (Whoa)
This is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)
