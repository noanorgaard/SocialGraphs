Is it love, if it was, am I livin' it? (What?)
Do I live in it? (Yeah) So astounding
Love is an ocean, you can drown me
The sweet embrace, the lovely taste I taste, and see I'm under grace, the place to be (Yeah)
It means I don't ever need an umbrella
I'm cool in the cold and the hot weather
Whether or never I ever understand I'm a man in the hands of great plans
I stand with faith in a life I never known or touched, it's still outside my clutch but
I'm like, what's to dream of? What's to hope in? What's to die for? Live to no end?
This is living, the life I've been given's a gift
If I'ma live it, I'ma live it to death

Immerse me in the wonder of Your love

Consuming all my reckless ways
My sins submerged, Your love has saved my soul
Your love is like a storm

Behind the Scenes:


… to the streets:
I lived heart on the wire
Hand in the fire for so long
But You've shown me better
A new kind of love
It's ever the one I want

I'm lifting You higher, higher
There's nothing that I'd rather do
A sweet elevation of praises
There's no one I love more than You

I never knew a love like this before
The kind of life I can not find on my own
I've seen the world now I have never been so sure
That I want Your heart
God, I just want to be where You are
Where You are
I just want to be where You are

Your love, like nothing I've seen
My wildest of dreams don't come close
I've never known better than living like this
I cannot resist You, Lord
