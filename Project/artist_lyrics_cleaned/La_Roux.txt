Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand

And not let go of my hand, my hand
My hand, my hand, my hand, my hand
My hand, my hand, my hand, my hand
My hand, my hand, my hand, my hand
And not let go—

And not let go of my—

I hang my hopes out on the line, ooh
Well they'd be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long, ooh
They'll be withered by the sun

Let's go to war to make peace
Let's be cold to create heat
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand

And not let go of my hand, my hand
My hand, my hand, my hand, my hand

I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

Set me up slowly
That's what you do to me
Oh you set me up slowly
Now I can't come down, down
Let you down gently
That's what I think you need
But when I let you down you're empty
And you try to hide your frowns, frowns

I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it
And I hope it's sinking in
That behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me

Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
So we're not so far apart, apart

(Let me down, let me down)
(Let me down, let me down)
(oh won't you please let me down)
(oh won't you please let me down)
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it
And I hope it's sinking in
That behind your perfect skin
There's a part of you that's free
And I know that there's a place for me

How do you feel in the night
Now the feeling's left behind
As you know there was a time
When your silence left me blind
Now you're callin' from the aisle
I can see, it's denial
A denial left to slide
Now there's nothing left to

Are you're just not good enough?

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

He wants to go
Where the red lights shine so bright, shine so bright
He wants to know
Why he feels so cold inside, cold inside
He turns and looks around, he doesn't hear a sound
No one's around, no one's around

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
