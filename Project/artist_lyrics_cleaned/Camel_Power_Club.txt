Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby

Stop trying to look like mothers in the TV show
Why would you want to be someone you do not know?
Girl you're not so pretty even in the winter snow
You deserve much better, I think it's time to grow

Swinging on that heartbeat, hippie yay-hey

Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
Shake it off baby, shake it off baby
