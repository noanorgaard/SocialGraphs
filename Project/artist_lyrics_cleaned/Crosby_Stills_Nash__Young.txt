One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way
And new eyes to see the dawn
Go your way, I'll go mine
And carry on

The sky is clearing and the night
Has gone out
The sun, he come, the world
Is all full of love
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice
But to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able
To sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which
We get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues
And carry on

Carry on
Love is coming
Love is coming to us all



Where are you going now, my love?
Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness?
Will you bring me sorrow?

Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do with what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?

Girl, when I was on my own
Chasing you down
What was it made you run?
Trying your best just to get around
The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to 

Staring at the fire
For hours and hours while I listen to you
Play your love songs all night long
For me, only for me

Come to me now
And rest your head for just five minutes
Everything is done

Such a cozy room
The windows are illuminated by the evening
Sunshine through them, fiery gems
For you, only for you

Our house is a very, very, very fine house
With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy cause of you
And our

While you place the flowers in the vase
