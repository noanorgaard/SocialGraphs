What the hell did I do last night?
That's the story of my life
Like tryin' to remember words
To a song nobody wrote

And it's sad and it's long and can't nobody sing along
It's a southbound train, it's a whistle in the wind
Ain't no one there to care where I've been
I'm hummin' on that lonesome song again

I took a trip across the country from Montgomery
Discovered I'd been wrong for so long
I thought it was the fame and the glory and the money
But all I've got to show is a damn song

And it's sad and it's long, can't nobody sing along
It's a southbound train, it's a whistle in the wind
There's no one there to sing to in the end
I'm hummin' on that lonesome song again

And it's sad and it's long, can't nobody sing along
It's a southbound train, it's a whistle in the wind
There's no one there to care where I've been
I'm hummin' on that lonesome song again

The mornin' sun made it's way
Through the windshield of my Chevrolet
Whiskey eyes and ashtray breath
On a chert rock gravel
