You know, the bartenders, they all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pullin' up lame
And I'm a pool shootin' shimmy shyster shakin' my head
When I should be living clean instead

You know, the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well, they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel, yeah
Take your love and then they leave on out of town, you know they do


Well now, fallin' in love is such a breeze

These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
