The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
About the town (Aah)
To lift a glass
Ah, don't look down

The party's on (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The spirit's up (Aah)
We're here tonight
And that's enough

And they could float above the grass
In circles if they tried
A latent power I know they hide
To keep some hope alive
That a girl like I
Could ever try
Could ever try

So we just skirt the hallway sides
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines
And wonder why
There's no connection

A week of rolling eyes
And cheap shots from the tribe
And we're off to Nemarca's porch again
Another afternoon
Of the goat-head tunes
And pilfered booze

We wander through her mama's house
The milk from a window lights
Family portrait, circa '95
This is that foreign land
With the sprayed-on tans
And it all feels fine
Be it silk or slime

So, when they tap our Monday heads
Two zombies walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our climb
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection

Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh

Until this turn in my head
I let you stay and you paid no rent
I spent twelve long months
On the lam
That's enough sitting on the fence
For the fear of breaking dams

I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head
You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there

It took me all of a year
To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground
You want to fight for this love
But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby it's clear

You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance
Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around
I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head
You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number 

I took a pledge to grow up
Then drank enough to make me throw up
On all my dearly disappointed friends
I'm just too lazy to make amends with you anyway
That's why the pattern still remains

There's half a million things that I'm supposed to be
Shelter in the nighttime, a punk running free
And if it gets too deep, I reach for my guitar
And if I try hard

I find something I could really drop into
And everything that was is just a thing that I can sing
Everything is something next to nothing
As crazy as it seems, you give it up and you are free

Another candle to blow out, new set of dark thoughts to shut out
And everybody's got their remedies
But nothing works like chemistry, so raise a toast
No more sipping from the fire hose

When I was just nine years old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest

I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and play like a stone
Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

My life in an up-turned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift
And you tell me with your tongue
And your breath goes in my lungs
And we float over the rift

Well this will be your simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never

Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Turn me back into the pet
I was when we met
I was happier then with no mindset

And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well, I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

New slang when you notice the stripes
The dirt in your fries
Hope it's right when you die
Old and bony
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
Never should have called
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely

May they all cut their thumbs

Without a trust, a flaming field
Am I too dumb to refine?

And I just can't get her out of my bed
Wish I'd gone with her sister instead
Love life imploded, my dice were all loaded
Can't get her out of my bed

I know
If she gave a fuck then it would show
And she wouldn't have me stabbing other boys
Like it's just a bit of sweetness she enjoys

Devil's daughter
So much for Simon's "50 Ways..."
What can a lonely boy do when all else seems inferior
No come-along will pull me away

And I just can't get her out of my bed
Should've mainlined saltpeter instead
My vices have voted, her ass duly noted
Can't kick her out of my bed

Hold on, maybe this girl is alright
Just wants the benefit of a modern love life
And I don't know the difference anymore

Don't mention boundaries on the phone
They slide and glide on out the door

Can't get her out of my bed
Can't get her out of my bed
My vices have voted, her ass duly noted
Can't get her out of my bed

I don't know what I'm hoping for
So silently I'm opening the latch
I swear she'll be the last one I 

You entertaining any doubt
Cause you had to know that I was fond of you
Fond of Y-O-U
Though I knew you masked your disdain
I can see the change was just too hard for us
Hard for us
You always had to hold the reins
But where I'm headed, you just don't know the way

So, affections fade away
And do adults just learn to play the most ridiculous, repulsive games?
All our favorite ruddy sons and their double-barreled guns
You'd better hurry rabbit, run, run, run
'Cause mincing you is fun
And there's a lot of hungry hatters in this world, set on takin' it over
Like brittle, thorny stems, they break before they bend
And neither one of us is one of them

And the tears will never mend

Boy, I still don't know
I don't know why and I don't care

Hatin' me
When I'd been so much more than fair
But then you'd have to lay those feelings bare

One thing I know has still got you scared
You're all that cold ire and never once aired on a dare


You had to know that I was fond of you
Fond of Y-O-U
So I took your licks at the time (Da da da da dum)
And a change like that is just so hard to do
Hard to do
Don't let it whip-crack your life
And I'll bow out from the fight
Those old pious sisters were right
The worst part is over, now get back on that horse and
