Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window

Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

Bowlin' alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Starin' at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby, two weeks ain't really all that long

Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry (I cry) for him out the window

Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
In a love triangle, yeah


Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle, oh
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love 

Somebody's gotta make him get dressed up
Give him a reason to wash that truck
Somebody's gotta teach him how to dance
So God made girls

He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful and breakable that lights up in the dark

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world"
And God made girls (For singing in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world"
And God made girls

Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive
Give him a reason to hold that door so God made girls

Somebody's gotta put up a fight
Make him wait on a Saturday night
To walk downstairs and blow his mind
So God made girls

Something that can wake him up and call his bluff and drag his butt to church
Something that is hard to handle
Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, I'm 'bout to rock your world
And God made girls (For singing in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world"
And God made girls

Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

So God made girls, God made girls
He stood back and told the boys, I'm 'bout to rock your world
And God made girls (For singing in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys, "I'm 'bout to rock your world"
And God made girls
Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt
Somebody's gotta wanna hold his hand

So God made
