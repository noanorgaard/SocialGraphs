Maybe he's in Florida, somewhere in the pines
Maybe on the delta throwin' out a line
Maybe he's in Georgia, starin' at the stars
Maybe Tennessee pickin' on a guitar
Right now, there's somethin'
'bout a boy from the south

Yeah, the first time I felt it I was only 16
And he kissed me underneath the china berry tree
Said "Goodnight darlin'," with a sweet southern drawl
Man, I think I might just have to love them all
The boys from the South
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe in Kentucky, workin' in the mines
Maybe down in Little Rock, just to pass the time
Maybe he's somewhere in New Orleans
Livin' it up in the Big Easy
Right now, there's somethin' 'bout a boy from the South

This diamond ring on my hand's
The only good thing that came from that man
Got a GTO from one named Joe
And a big piece of land down in Mexico
I'm hell on heels
Baby, I'm comin' for you

I got a pink guitar, a Lincoln town car
From ol' what's-his-name I met at a bar
Got a high-rise flat in Hollywood
From a married man wasn't up to no good
I'm hell on heels
Baby, I'm comin' for you

Then there's Jim, I almost forgot
I ran him off, but I took the yacht
Poor ol' Billy, bless his heart
I'm still usin' his credit card
I'm hell on heels
Sugar daddy, I'm comin' for you

Raised up right in the hills of Kentucky
Although she ain't gonna smile 'til she lights up her Lucky
No filter on her mouth or her cigarettes
Oh, baby, what you're lookin' at is what you get

We owe four hundred dollars to the boys in the band
Gas light's blinkin' on our broke-down van
Livin' off truck stop burgers and fries
Crossin' our fingers for a vacancy sign
Well, who in the hell's gonna pay these bills
When one's drinkin', one's smokin', one's takin' pills

She's a rootin' tootin' pistol from the Lone Star State
She mixes up a double at the break of every day
She might get crazy, but she don't get mean
Until some drunk cowboy asks her to sing

We like fast men and cheap guitars
Ain't tryna get rich, just tryna get by
By playin' for tips on Saturday night
