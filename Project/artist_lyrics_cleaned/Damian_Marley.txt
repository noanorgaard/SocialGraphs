(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage

So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh

Me do a thousand video shooting, ten thousand chariot
Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop
Mi deejay til' me hoarse a welcome people to the rock
You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks
I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact
Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract
Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot
Big Gong to the Zilla and the return of the 

Such a short way up and such a long way down
Chalice it a bubble like we deh a Ray Town
Di way yuh sup’n nuff it haffi weigh by pound
Inna fields of marijuana that is my playground
I love you Mary Jane!
You're the prettiest of flowers, girl me can't complain
When I'm with you I feel so high I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

Your leaves of green, your purples and blue

And I say to myself, what a wonderful herb

Look how Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
Fi your love whole heap a man serve years
Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
And now the whole a dem a buy shares
You should be a celebrity, amongst any tree
Across the seven seas, for your energy
But you're an enemy, catching felonies
For the remedies in your recipes, whoa

Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation - Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation - your medication makes me high, hey

Ask me how you feel, splendid indeed
With a likkle bit a black splendid weed
A purest grow indoors, not a stick nor seed
And she never force ripe, it was a real slow speed
No fertilizer, natural baby feed
No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need
Medication - your medication makes me high
Just be patient - I'm like a patient trying to find

Elevation - your medication makes me high, 

Welcome to Jamrock
Camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pound a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack
It inna yuh back pack
The smell a give yah girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
'Cause Sandals ah no "Back-To"
Di thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bear tuff thing come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Den dem wheel and pop-off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep an' dem can't stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, a playboy rabbit
Get drop like a bad habit
So nuh bother pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

Welcome to Jamdown
Poor people a dead at random
Political violence, can't done
Bare ghost and Phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the king of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unno hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit nuh fit me
To win election dem trick we
Den dem don't do noting at all
Come on, let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most of the youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem tek the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Gloc, say dem a lock rocket
Dem wi full you up a current like ah shock socket
Dem wi run a road block which part the cops block it
And from now till a morning nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck-back ratchet
