She just wanna ride with us
Yeah yeah yeah
She just wanna ride with us
Aha aha aha
She just wanna ride with us
Yeah yeah yeah

She just wanna ride with us
She just tryna cool with us
She just wanna vibe with us
She know she can’t lose with us

She just wanna vibe out, when there’s no light out
Yeah she’s a night owl, out all night 'til it’s light out
Can’t blame her, she wanna roll with a winner
Used to roll in with the opposites, and she fell in love with it, go figure
Black on black when we mob out, girls out when we around town
Deuces up ‘cause we out here, and I’m starting to feel alive now
And I’m faded, she’s looking at me like I’m famous
Bad chicks, black whips, closed off, no ventilation
Riding through the city, your girl probably with me
They will never get me, never gon’ forget me
I made sure they remember, signed her up now she a member
Got these females front and center, if she down with it then we get her

She just wanna ride with us
She just tryna cool with us
She just wanna vibe with us
She know can’t lose with us

She just tryna ride out
She just tryna ride, yeah
Vibe out, all night, all night
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
We just tryna ride, she just tryna vibe

Addicted to this lifestyle, party girl, nice smile
It all gets familiar now, all these girls the same
Yeah they like the nice scene, be around up-comming fame
She know how we get down, that’s the reason that she came
Told your girl don’t fall in love, never catch me slippin’
Don’t think that you’re number one, might just call you Pippen
Asshole, yeah I told you so, don’t tell me things I already know
Love the flow, if you down then grab your things, girl it’s time to go
I can be your boyfriend for the night
You know that I wanna do you right
Take you places where we’re outta sight
So baby tell me are you down to ride?
She just wanna ride with us
She just tryna cool with us
She just wanna vibe with us
She know she can’t lose with us

She just tryna ride out
She just tryna ride, yeah
Vibe out, all night, all night (Ride wit’ us, come vibe, vibe)
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
Ride with us, come vibe with us all night, all night
We just tryna ride, she just tryna vibe out

Ride with us, come vibe with us
