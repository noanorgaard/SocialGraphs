I'm fresh off the block, the hustler just returned
I DeBo'd these niggas, now they call me big worm
I'm the shit according to the streets
The town without Gyft would make Memphis bleak
But I don't toss up rocks, signs, and diamonds
But I might toss a nappy-headed ho like Imus said
Let's do it, I'm ready
We right back at them, I'm Memphis best
I know you feel hesitant, but I'm so positive
They couldn't see me in the negative
Negative, not today, no sir
They say life is a bitch, yeah I know her
When you see her, tell the bitch to holler
Cause I'm too fucking white t-shirt to live blue collar
Let's go

People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People, people, people, people
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
Come on baby let the good times roll

I love you haters, they make my focus strong
They keep me motivated, to get my hustle on
Get my guap up, no Scott Storchin'
Put 30s on the truck, now that's a wheel of fortune
I got a lotta women but no baby mamas
They all material girls, I call em primadonnas
Dog I promise, real talk, let's get back into it
I'm outta East Haven
Morningview and Rosefield
And we don't fuck with rats
We treat them like road kill
Fuck them, sucker you ain't cool nowhere
I'd rather Jordin Spark theem and leave them with no air
I'm Mariah Carey, the Nick Cannon
So much heat on the boy you feel like he tanning
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People, people, people, people
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
Come on baby let the good times roll

And when I step through it bow down gracefully
Swagged out, speechless so there's nothing they can say to me
Just wave to me cause they can't compete
I dream of this shit, which means I'm better than dudes in my sleep
But they hard-headed, sleep blinded
Gotta put a bullet through homie brain to make him open-minded
Shawty had to rewind it, had to do it my dude
Come on back baby
The ladies love me, they say my aura shines
Got so many tens, niggas thought it was the march of dimes
They jocking GY when I walk past
I ain't gotta sag my jeans it to show my motherfucking ass
You can't be me, my ink pen's bleeding
My shit so full of life it leave the paper breathing
And on that note I'm leaving
I'm leaving, you dig?
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
People, people, people, people
People see me but they just don't know
People see me but they just don't know
Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on
Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on baby, come on
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come on
