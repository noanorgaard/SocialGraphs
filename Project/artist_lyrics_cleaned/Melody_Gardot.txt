If I gave a thought to fascination I would know it wasn't right to care
Logic doesn't seem to mind that I am fascinated by your love affair
Still my heart would benefit from a little tenderness from time to time but never mind
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

Baby, I should hold on just a moment and be sure it's not for vanity
Look me in the eye and tell me love is never based upon insanity, yeah
Even when my heart is beating, hurry up the moment's fleeting
Kiss me now, don't ask me how
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in loveYou might also 

If the stars were mine I tell you what I'd do
I'd put those stars right in a jar and give 'em all to you

If the birds were mine I'd tell them when to sing
I'd make them sing a sonnet when your telephone would ring
I would put them there inside the square whenever you went out
So there'd always be sweet music whenever you'd walk about

If the birds were mine I tell you what I'd do
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you


If the world was mine I'd paint it gold and green
I'd make the oceans orange for a brilliant color scheme
I would color all the mountains, make the sky forever blue
So the world would be a painting and I'd live inside with you

I'd wrap the world in ribbons and then give it all to you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you

Is a pretty good start for us two
And if in the world, there were only tristesse
I would find happiness in the blues
Mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to be
In all that I've seen, all the love that I need
Is the love that reminds me of you
In every smile is a trace of the joy
That I feel like a sweet morning too
Mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to be
Mira, mira, mira
Oh, mira, look at what you do to me
Mira, look at all the fantasy
Mira, this is such a lovely way to beYou might also 

Your eyes may be whole
But the story I'm told
Is your heart is as black as night
Your lips may be sweet
Such that I can't compete
But your heart is as black as night

I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind

'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black as night


I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind

'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black
Your heart is as black
Oh, your heart is as black as night
