Brave men didn't die face down
In the Vietnam muck so I could not style on you
I didn't walk uphill both ways to the booth and back to not wile on you
You think baby Jesus killed Hitler just so I'd whisper?
And you're safe and sound and these crooks tapped your phone to not have a file on you?
Huh
What, me worry? Nah, buddy, I've lost before, so what?
You don't get it, I'm dirt, motherfucker, I can't be crushed
Fuckers, open the books up and stop bullshitting the kid
My dick got a Michelin star, I'm on par with the best ever took the gig
I'm a super cat, from don dada to dusk, don't bother to touch
I got firm clutch on the grip and the bucks
I might ghost ride a tank, take a ride to the bank
I'm the son of Rick Rubin rushing full-thrust
Don't flash weak shit to the Shark Tank judge
Talk real good 'cause I'm smart and stuff
We a good crew to fuck with, better to love

I told y'all suckers, I told y'all suckers. I told y'all on RTJ1, then I told ya again on RTJ2, and you still ain't believe me. So here we go, RTJ3
Talk to me
(RTJ)
Talk to 

Doctors of death
Curing our patients of breath
We are the pain you can trust
Crooked at work
Cookin' up curses and slurs
Smokin' my brain into mush
I became famous for flamin' you fucks
Maimin' my way through the brush
There is no training or taming of me and my bruh
Look like a man, but I'm animal raw

We are the murderous pair
That went to jail and we murdered the murderers there
Then went to Hell and discovered the devil
Delivered some hurt and despair
Used to have powder to push
Now I smoke pounds of the kush
Holy, I'm burnin' a bush
Now I give a fuck about none of this shit
Jewel runner over and out of this bitch

Woo!

Woo!

Copping of uppers and downers get done
I'm in a rush to be numb
Droppin' a thousand ain't much
Come from the clouds
On a missile to turn this whole town into dust
Don't make a sound, baby, hush
I am the living swipe right, on the mic I'm a slut
I don't know how to not spit like a lout
I'll spill a pound of my kids on your couch

Half of a mongrel and mythical team
Villainous treacherous things
Legend says El is a spawn out of Hell
The myth is my mama's a murderous queen
Your life can end like in Godfather 1
You get the gun as I christen my son
If I die today and it's Hell I should pay
Tell the Lord "Mikey said, "Fuck, it was fun""
Every new record's my dick in a box
We get a doozy, the moola's a lock
You're getting used to me doing no wrong
I don't play chicken, you prick, I'm a fox
You wanna kick it, I'll give you the rocks
You kiss the wood chipper blade if you bark
I'm fuckin' magic, in fact I'm a warlock of talk
I got a unicorn horn for a (Stop)

Woo!
Woo!
Step into the spot like, woo!
Woo!

And the crowd goes RTJ!

Mike Pentangeli won't snitch
I'll rent a room at the Ritz
I'll sip a fifth of the whisk
I'll smoke a dub in the tub
Then I will split both my wrists

I'll pull a sword on you simps
Just with a flick of the wrist
Get your neck giving up mist
Me and Mike skip away whistlin' and grin
Every day's golden when you only win

Bullyin' bastards and beatin' on beats
Sounds like a day at the beach, preach
I keep it middle school, step on your feet
Before you can speak, blaow! to the teeth

We move among the ones you think are meek
You think I'm lion, you right, see my teeth
Don't be a bore when I'm roaring vamoose
Hunting's no fun when your prey doesn't move
I'll put a gun to a bunny like choose
Say somethin' funny or bunny go boom
You got a bevy of shit you could groove
We'd like to thank you for choosing our crew

And that's from the crew you can trust
Warranty plus for fuckin' shit up
We are the no-gooders, do-gooders
Known to the dancers and dealers and doers of 

Ayy
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? Ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, motherfuckers?
Or take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn, I love the smell
Blanket to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom 'cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

We, we out of order, your honor, you're out of order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a flip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
And we the type to greet the preacher with a grin and a gun
Come on

A wise man once said, "We all dead, fuck it"
Just spit it disgustin', youngin', and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'
Waitin' for their christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in, uh
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers, enslavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
So strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God'll forgive 'em
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
R-run them, run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast

It's De La on the cut, lifting six on your snitching crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burning mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now the trey spray and victim you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dickin' you
With clips in the bottom, we dipping through Gotham
Yes, eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Rip like Rakim Allah, feds is checkin' my melody
Yes, aggressively testin' with bunk stretches and penalties
Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still piling fast bucks, Afghani toe-taggin'
Now they trackin' me and we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
R-run them, run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them

Run the Jewels live at the Garden
Licking off shots and we aim for the darkness
Make it get hot for a target
Kids cook S'mores off the crotch of our targets, Kumbaya bitch
Buckle up lil' trooper
Can't get past me, I'm stuck in the future
Shit ain't all it's cracked up to be
The hovercraft's cool but the air's so putrid

You can tell by the stench in the air
Blood's on the ground, opportunity is here
I'm lookin' into space like "Is anybody there?
And if aliens are here, please tell me how near
Do you come in peace or should everybody fear?
I'll await your reply with a blunt and a beer."

I smoke farm to face by the field full, partner
Life's a shitnado, the smoke my umbrella
The boy's back turnin' the slacks to Old Yeller (Prick)
It's a daily lick, I slit throats with a grin that reek of pure shit
Travel by backflip, eat from the river, the panther heart taught to talk by smart chicks
Sip pure venom and skipped away grinnin'

Jesse James gang, we'll walk you through the process
You don't wanna be a hero, do not let that thought process
We will put a bullet where your thoughts get processed
Get that fuck shit straight like a perm or a process
'Cause for real the money money ain't the motherfuckin' object
We just like excitement, gun fights, indictments
High speed chase through Manhattan in the night winds
Ooh, it's the thrill of the kill

Got head, watch Vice at her home in Decatur

Full clip, I'm a little bit sick, come equipped
Look at what I did for the grit, got it lit, what a cinch
Brought 'em just a little pinch of the truth, and they flip
Now they hanging from my shit, lil’ bit

You're gonna need a bigger boat, boys, you're in trouble
Aye, gonna need a little hope, boys, on the double
Aye, you muckin' with a G here, see? Talk to me
Or maybe listen to the man that barely dodged his own lobotomy
Pop the tape in, baby, we got shit we wrote for you, for you
Came from feeling what a pure absence of hope can do
Only to leap through flaming rings and break the nose of crews
Still in their wings'll be them darlings, hope they've broken you
Yeah, they better hope that
I'm a full force and a cold fact
See the cold floor where I licked dirt
When the dough dried and the pride died
Had a dumb max, had to shop right
Gimme two meals and the lights on
I'ma do right, get a new crew
Make a new life, never boo-hoo
Never lose sight, I'm a voodoo
With a burst heart from an old soul
Better stop, drop when the squad's hot, we don't stop a lot
We don't talk a lot about it, we just pop it off a lot
I'm high, man, I'm a cosmonaut
Scream, "Fuck 'em!" 'til they lop our bloody noggins off
I promise y'all
My, my, y'all, I coulda died, y'all
A couple times I took my eyes off the prize, y'all
I know a few people pray for my demise, y'all
But like cream, I had to rise, I had to rise, y'all
Who am I, y'all? I coulda died, y'all

Lift up our glasses and watch your palaces burn to ashes
Fucking fascists, who the fuck are you to give fifty lashes?
All 'cause I'm motivated, stimulated, never smoking simulated happy and burning hashes
Killer, killer, dealing with him like he's a squealer
Get 'em, hit 'em, got 'em, shot 'em, and flipped the mattress
Woo! I'm the man, bitch, got big ideas, got plans to rob
Any Rothschild living, Bill Gates, and the ghost of Jobs
Yeah, I said it, I meant it, I ain't flinch'n, Marshawn Lynch'n it
Run through a motherfucker's face like ig'nant, isn't it
Domain eminent, we the pre-eminant
Villainous willingness, spitting this ready raw rap shit rhyme ridiculous

In the Berenstain riff, I'm a Biff, so sick when the clock is lit, the whip swerve

Get pearl tongue like every day, so I Run them Jewels in every state

New bitch all on my ding-a-ling and when she ride on it, she wet like a jet-ski

How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that "Revolution's right here, right now"
And they ain't callin' off

Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
Love will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let 'em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, try to laugh hard and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on, like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

And I don't know how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't even really seein' it right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light
(Beam of the light, beam of the light)
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me 

I'm up at midnight, I'm dippin' off in my Nizzikes
A gun and a metal pizzipe, a knizzife is to my rizzight
I'm lurkin' servin' on pussies who lack a purpose
I've got 'em filled up with frizzight like, "Mizzike is you all rizzight?"
I'm lookin' lurkin' on bitches twerkin' for service
The bitches bag is a Birkin, I'm yellin' screamin' and cursin'
I'm puttin' pistols in faces at random places like
Bitch give it up or stand adjacent to Satan
Bad man chillin', the villains is here
No Jesuses here, I hear the demons in my ear
And I want it, I need it, see it, I take it
Never fake it, wrap you motherfuckers up, leave you naked
The jewel runners, top tag team for two summers
Live and let live, fuck you cuz cause that's a fool's honor
I'm walkin' totin' on two llamas
You niggas ass and trash and trash, fuck it, I'm too honest
So fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely
And that's about the psyche of Jaime and Mikey
You meet another pair better - highly unlikely
And if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me
I live for the thrill of the kill, yes it excites me
You know your favorite rapper ain't shit and me, I might be
The closest representation of God you might see
Pay honors like your momma young sonna and take a right knee
The passion of Pac, the depth of Nas, circa nine three
Mix the mind of Brad Jordan and Chuck D and find me
I spit with the diction of Malcolm or say a Bun B

Maybe you should be careful when flippin' a stranger's switch
Like assumin' the war is won ain't a symptom of arrogance
When nothin' to lose a step up then everything's for the win
So we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dicks
I live to spit on your grave, my existence is to disgrace you
The kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food
That's why we got the people behind us
While other rappers are vaginas for the fame, the jewel runners will always stay rude
Motherfuck your permission, was never yours to begin with
And every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fuckin' prison
I been here makin' raw shit and never asked to be lauded
Run the Jewels is the answer, your question is "What's
