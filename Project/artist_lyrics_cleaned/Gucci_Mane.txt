Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Diamond chains, tennis chains, assault rifles, gambling
Sellin' dope and trickin' folks that run in my family
My daddy was an alcoholic, momma she's a junkie daughter
Cousin smokin' crack, I guess she forgot all my aunt done taught her
Plus I got two brothers that I don't know from a addicted father
And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sellin' sets out my momma window, tryna' get a new starter
Treat Sun Valley like Decatur, mountain park like port Arthur
I know my family dysfunctional
So God please help these country folks
Tired and broke, in need of hope
Sheetrock, heroin, crack, and coke

The third week out of rehab, man, he forget the shit they teachin' him
Like why you smokin' blunts and sippin' lean and you a millionaire
Wrecked my yellow lamb, high on drugs I didn't give a care
Smashed my black Ferrari two weeks later, now it need repair
Demons in my ear, got me seein' things wasn't even there
People in my circle say they care, but they don't really care
But I can't blame nobody but myself, it starts with myself
Cause rap can bring you wealth, but that wealth can destroy your health
Lookin' in the mirror at myself, had to catch my breath
And tell myself that "Gucci, you an addict!" That's the first step

Nós temos London na faixa
Drop top, wop
Se o Jovem Metro não confiar em você, eu vou atirar em você

Armação da Cartier, me chame de quatro olhos
Ainda posso cozinhar um bagulho com meus dois olhos fechados
Um monte de gente ainda tem um monte de merda pra falar sobre as roupas e as fotos que eu posto
Mas está um dia lindo lá fora hoje
Não sei que carro eu vou dirigir hoje
Promotor me trouxe 200 mil e eu vou contar na mão todas as notas de 100 com meus dois olhos fechados

Eu tenho uma gata tão boa que faz um homem cego enxerga-la
Ela está na minha cabeça, essa é uma ótima ideia
E eu não sou Blake Griffin, eu não dirijo um Kia
Se não for por 10 milhões, eu não posso assinar nenhum acordo
Eu só tô pela grana, Nikes novos, vamos fazer isso
E eu espiono uma vadia que quer fuxicar, se intrometer
Tutorial da função, dirigindo pela Memorial
Do barraco para o Waldorf Astoria
Se você não gosta de ver os manos brilharem, então feche seus olhos
Eu vou estar numa ilha privada, curtindo os violinos
Autobiografia, Gucci Mane o autor
E eu sou o patrocinador da função, Gucci Mane o pai
Mano de 8 dígitos acabou de entrar no Walter’s
Se você não tá ganhando dinheiro então saia da Georgia
100 mixtapes e contando, cheque minha discografia
O mano mais estiloso vivo, cheque sua fotografia

Vendi um Adderall para o meu primo porque ele está no final do semestre

Mantenho algumas garotas bonitas ao meu redor em qualquer lugar que eu vou
Nós saímos da rua, abra uma garrafa, vamos brindar
Eu ando de olhos vendados com manos que sabem lutar
E ela disse "Vamos fazer amor", quer que eu foda com meus olhos fechados
Mas ela é tão boa que quando ela tirou a roupa
Eu fui direto com os dois olhos fechados
(Você é doido, mano)
Ha, espera um minuto, eu sou estilo pra caralho, deixa eu fazer uma pose
Desista, brilhando, branco e rosa dourado
Ela tá andando pela minha cobertura no meu roupão Versace
Desde jovem eu sigo o G-Code
Servindo da cozinha mas eu nunca toquei no fogão
Eu disse pra minha vadia: "Você é minha agora, você não precisa trabalhar
Só seja verdadeira e vamos gastar os milhões"
