And the source was your laughter, threw me off the wall
Used your face as a mascot, ay-ay-ay
And the medicine came after, left me in a storm
Many miles from the Cessna
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

One of many in the mess hall, family there and all
Making money on the desktop, ay-ay-ay
Was at war with the fast cars, many chemicals
In the eyes of the master (Burst!)
(Master in every way)
Sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, sa
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

For the love of the soft game, ay-ay-ay
Made of models set in plaster, ay-ay-ay
When in doubt of the last year, gather all your fear
Dip your hand in the blender (Burst!)

In your wallet was your gender, stolen when in Rome
In the shadow of your blender, ay-ay-ay
Was a secret of the bedroom, blemish in the chrome
In the eye of the bender (Burst!)

(Chiku!)
Sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa, sa ka ni sa
Kesa ka ni sasareta, kesa ka ni sasareta

It all began with a burst now, every several months
And the chemicals came after, ay-ay-ay
It was a race to be faster, quicker than the worst
In the style of the master

Who knew, my ingenue
That we could never be together
Unless we do a deed we can't undo?
And even if I sing that song
We could be right but we could be so wrong
Feed the dream, does it seem
That we're pushing at the sun?

And if you loved her, would you fake it?
And every letter, would you burn it?
'Cause every time I hear the way she said it
I can't let go, can't let go

I say
If I could make you fade away
I could play the game I know so well
It's a fair trade
Many of the things I've said
Were made from the beautiful things I regret
Though the words we made, I feel the pain
Cannot know if it's worth it, never

I knew this avenue
Where everybody has a piece of their heart on the street
For us all to view
And even if I feel alone
You know I'm just a man of flesh and bone
Feed the dream, does it seem
Like we're staring at the sun?

And if you loved her, would you fake it?
And every letter, would you burn it?

Lucid lovers me and you
A deal of matchless value
I was always quick to admit defeat
Empty statements of bones and meat
And my heart it shook with fear
I'm a coward behind a shield and spear
Take this sword and throw it far
Let it shine under the morning star

Who are you? Who am I to you?
I am the antichrist to you
Fallen from the sky with grace
Into your arms race

One for my heart and two for show
Three tears for all the souls below
One day we made them into figurines
Burned them all with all my favorite things
