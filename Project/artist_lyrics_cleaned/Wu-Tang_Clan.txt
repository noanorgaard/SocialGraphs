I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had second hands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now

It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I 'scape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: What's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and stray shots
All on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money

Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta fuck wit!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta fuck wit!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta fuck wit!

Yo, there's no place to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom!
Bam! Aw, man! I slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossin', enforcin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more Family Feud than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, "You're dead!"
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin' head!
MZA "Who is that?!" A-yo, the Wu is back!
Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no one — oh, no! Here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum

Put the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T. 
Now, why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake and eat it, too
With my crew while we head state-to-state

The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, get busy, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more Afro than Rollo
Comin' to a fork in the road — which way to go? Just follow!
Meth is the legend, niggas is Sleepy Hollow
In fact, I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin' on through
Niggas is like, "Oh, my God, not you!"
Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor
Comin' from the RZA, which is short for The Razor
Who make me reminisce true like déjà vu
I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me, sticks to you
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta fuck wit!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta fuck wit!

Yo, niggas from The Source

True, true, my nigga Crown, what's goin' down, boy?

Niggas from D.C., down in Maryland
All the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
All over the whole fuckin' globe, comin' through, boy
Peace to the fuckin' Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin' heads, boy
It ain't safe no more, 

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World, the Order slaughter men, women and children
Ten feet gates surround the building, keep us sealed in
The projects — lifeless like a Vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performin' a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Tryna reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
The life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute the scientist mind

A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads to skin irritations
Babies bein' born with disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain
Screams of terror are hidden by the passin' trains
This can't be little Hussein
His uncle cries as he drops to his nephew's side, holdin' his cane
Just give me a name of who has inflicted this bitter sickness
And left us to witness

Yo, curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothin' godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
While we die, hard-livin' people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin and sin and killin' what's revealin'
Is a never endin' battle with no endin' or beginnin', listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's Most Wanted, good life — flaunt it, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some wanna be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be? The ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breathe and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best
You can't party your life away, drink your life away
Smoke your life away, fuck your life away
Dream your life away, scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Y'all bitches love dances and pullin' down your pants
While your man's on tour, you're spendin' up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
15 years old, shorty ass and top out
99 cent beer drinkin', pussy stinkin'
Fuckin' so much, your ass and titties start shrinkin'
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays?
Inside my lab, I'm goin' mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breakin' down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn early light
Why is sons fightin' for the stripe?
As we dwell through this concrete hell, callin' it home
Mama say, "Take your time, young man, and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searchin' for them glory days he never had"
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The Cash Rule Everythin' now, we goin' down
These babies lookin' up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust and hate separate
Build the devil mind state, blood kin cannot relate
No longer brothers, we unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel, killin' each other

You can't party your life away, drink your life away
Smoke your life away, fuck your life away
Dream your life away, scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same 

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes split the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fateful step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra graceful music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperone, rotating ring kings
March of the Wooden Soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand and glow like flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebrum cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle, clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation
War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the axe
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that! Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You're two-faced, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cord by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz
Ayo, that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man-child walk
Swift notarizer, blue tank all up in the high-riser
New York Yank' visor, word tranquilizer
Just a dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat, God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed, God, substantiala
Max mostly, undivided, then slide in, sickening
Guaranteed, made 'em jump like Rod 

Put them cracks down you just started slanging two months ago
What up with Larry Francisco, tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standing there? Posing you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be running with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon' live what he did, what this nigga said?
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me, some niggas in Medina asking me
"You know some niggas in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up, they seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, treating shorty like Qur'an
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a carwash now, her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us, yo
She fainted at her baby wake now, watch the breakdown (face responsibility)
She fainted at her baby wake now, yo, watch the breakdown
Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street

Yo all of y'all niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not an act, this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your cliché
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
It's my turn, live niggas could pass
Two-faced rappers push their shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style, fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my thoughts get published
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?
Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up...
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?
Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up...
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?
Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?

One is invulnerable, in fact
It involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
36 of these can be fatal
