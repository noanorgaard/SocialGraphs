I just want to hold you
Keep you in my world

But you wanted to go higher
Take a chance and explode
Thought I was more than the afterlife
Thought I was more than the

Thought I was more than the, more than the
More than, baby
Ohh ohh ohh ohhh

Love's never clear in a haze
But you feel good in a sway
Calling me up for a ride
I pick you up, we fight
I say "the future is yours if you choose
And mine won't exist without you"
Nothing I say hits your heart
You keep me in the dark

I just want to hold you
Keep you in my world

But you wanted to go higher
Take a chance and explode
Thought I was more than the afterlife
Thought I was more than the
You're at the edge of your desire, left the story untold
Thought I was more than the afterlife
Thought I was more than the, more than the
More than, baby
Ohh ohh ohh ohhh
Don't tell me in my sleep
Don't tell me in my dreams
Don't tell me what you see
Show me with your touch
Show me with some love
Show me you'll stay with me
Don't tell me in my sleep
Don't tell me in my dreams
Don't tell me what you see
Show me with your touch
Show me with some love
Show me you'll stay with me

But you wanted to go higher
Take a chance and explode
Thought I was more than the afterlife
Thought I was more than the
You're at the edge of your desire, left the story untold
Thought I was more than the afterlife
Thought I was more than the, more than the
More than, baby
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
