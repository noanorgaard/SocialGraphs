But I know you arе alone again
When I see you therе
I'm in my bed

1 ContributorSailor Bull LyricsShotgun at you
Turnin' out too slow
I got my pride
Just leave it alone, run into your hole
I'll let you go
Run into your hole
I'll let you go
Your dragon skin
It makes me sick
Burnin' up your time
I'll do it for you
Run into your hole
I'll let you go
Run into your hole
I'll let you go
You're Sailor Bull
I'd never swallow, I'd rather that
This trap he has set on you
We'll hide
Say he's below, way down low
Full of lies he's come at you
Say ohhh, ohhh
I'll settle you

1 ContributorLove song LyricsThe clouds are hangin' low
I was hungry but now I know
Don't expect too much if you're moving slow
Don't expect too much if you're moving slow
The sky is broken where it was light
And your eyes shine dark as night
'Cause they only see the ground
Yes they only see the ground
I stumble along to the sound of drums
Always beating 'till it makes you numb
Always beating to escape death
Always beating to escape death
Make one tune that'll beat the rest
Just one tune that'll let you rest
Oh always singing to the tune of your breath
Oh always singing to the tune of your breath
All the plains across the coast
Running in circles like a wavy ghost
Looks like your plans are in the ground
Always keepin' your gaze down to the ground
And when you hear your friends callin'
And they wonder why you're stallin'
Just give in
Just give in
Give into the love that you can give

Into the love that you can give
Breath into the fire that you can breath
Into the fire that you breath
Commit to the crimes that you commit
To the crimes that you commit
Give into the hugs that you can give
Into the hugs that you can give
Give into the love that you can give
Into the love that you can

Somethin' other than the memories
