But maybe, maybe in another life
I could be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But, not tonight, no not tonight

What if he walks towards me
While all the blood is rushing right to my brain
What am I gonna say, what am I gonna say
I may stop breathing and freeze cuz
That's the story of my life
Wouldn't it be crazy
If he felt, how I felt, overwhelmed and terrified
But he took my hand
And he took his chance, can I have this dance
If only we were in a Cinderella story

Who would I be
To make my feelings known
I need a little audacity but it's not in my bones
I'm standing here, terrified
Broken hearted, I could die, ooooohh
I'm staring at him
But I forget to pick my face up off the floor
I feel like a fool
And even though I do
I only wanna tell him that I love him more, more

Maybe, maybe in another life
I would be the girl who walks up to the guy
And say hey my name is Elle
And I think you're kinda fly
But not tonight, not tonight, tonight

Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you’re so classic, I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweetest
I need you, with no gun to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don’t want to stop it

Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

You’re the weakness that I can’t control

Baby you all I need to get by
You’re fly, so you’re all I need to get high
You got it? Uh, so put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera’s on, no script though
These boys claiming they ball, got no grip though
My flow switch mode, it’s so schizo
So I’m the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've gotta love me, Cole World, no Snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You’re hoping I’m the one
But I already knew though
It ain’t no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed, make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
Cause the rumors that you heard about is true

Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I 

Clearly I'm gone and I'm going
Into the deep end
Far over my head
It's so unfair
I'm gone and its showing
All over my skin
Everyone knows gone and it shows
But I don't care
How do you make me smile
Simply by telling the time
You got the zealous eyes, eyes
I, I could just stare all day, lay there and melt away
I'm such a helpless case, case, case
I've done away with my pride
They say I'm out of my mind
Can't even say it's a lie

I long for you
It kills me to pretend
I'm not in love when I just am
But you don't understand
That we're such damn good friends...
We could be a whole lot more (2x)
But we're such damn good friends...

Two puzzles
Identical with the same piece
Missing from both never complete
Never achieving our true perfection
So why go scour the Earth for missed piece
Maybe the piece is in our kiss
Maybe the answers in my direction

Fumbling, giggling, silly as ever I get like this after one too many

Which turned into five, then turned into ten
And right now I don’t know how to say when

So can I get a refill?

Yeah, of your time
Cause you’re intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don’t know how much is too much, yeah

Can’t stand up!

Wishin' and hopin' that I don't blow it I'm nervous as hell

And right now I don’t even know what I’m saying

But until you say goodnight
All I know is that I’m staying!
