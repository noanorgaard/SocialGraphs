Felt those lips tell me 21 lies (yeah)
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Lov-Lovin' you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you sayin', "Darlin'
Your kiss is like an antidote"
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me...

Couldn't hear the thunder
But I heard your heart race
Couldn't see the rain
We're too busy makin' hurricanes (yeah)
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way
But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy

I've been a wild dog in this here part of town
No gun-slinging, no fool can bring me down
Now I've finally met my match and he's the baddest boy around
And I'll say it loud and proud

I'm stuck, I'm stuck
That boy he messed me up
I'm a fighter, I'm a champion, but I'm hanging up the gloves
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
'Cause your love has tamed the devil out of me
Stole my heart and pulled the rug under my feet
I was a careless Casanova, but you made my heart go weak
And I'm stuck, I'm stuck

Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no no
I'm stuck, I'm stuck

Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no no

Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Whoa, oh oh
