Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
You might also like
There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long, hmm
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Oh


There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah)
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long, ooh
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
