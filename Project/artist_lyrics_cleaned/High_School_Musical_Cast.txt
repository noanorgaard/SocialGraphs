Voices in my head tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin', they're pushin'
I know they've got a plan, but the ball's in my hands
This time, it's man to man
I'm drivin', fightin' inside a world that's upside down
And spinnin' faster
What do I do now, without you?

I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

I'm kickin' down the walls, I gotta make 'em fall
Just break through 'em all
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna
Fight to find myself, me and no one else
Which way? I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin'
Can't find the way that I should turn
I should turn, right or left?
It's, it's like nothin' works without you

I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

Yeah, the clock's runnin' down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her? Is it love?
Can the music ever be enough?
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
You can do it, you can do it

I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

Oh


I believe in dreamin', shootin' for the stars
Baby, to be number one, you've got to raise the bar
Kickin' and a-scratchin', grindin' out my best
Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success
Work our tails off every day
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away

¡Caliente!
¡Suave!

Yeah, we're gonna
Bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop, hop 'til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop, pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove 'til the music stops
Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top

Stump, stump, stump, do the rump

Well, if Troy can tell his secret, then I can tell mine
I bake
What?
I love to bake
Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy
Not another sound
Someday, I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée

Intelligence beyond compare
But, inside, I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep

Really wrong
And we gotta get things back where they belong

We can do it
Gotta play
Stick with what you know
We can do it
Hip hop, hooray
She has got to go
We can do it
Crême brûlée
Keep your voice down low
Not another peep, no
Not another word, no
Not another sound, no
Everybody, quiet
Why is everybody staring at you?
Not me, you
Because of the callbacks?
I can't have people staring at me, I really can't

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts

But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe we're breaking free

I don't recall you mentioning
The boss is such a creep

We still have the ingredients
To make this summer sweet

Well, I got rags instead of riches

And all these dirty dishes

Just wish I had three wishes

Okay, guys, break it up

We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out

I'd rather face a seven-footer
Straight up in the post (Yeah)

That sure beats hangin' here
And burnin' someone's toast (Uh-huh)

I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress

Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess

We're a champion team, a well-oiled machine
And we've faced tougher problems than this
I know it's a grind, but I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun while we get this job done
We've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
Got to work, work, there'll be no doubt
If we all come together, we can work this out

Let's work it

Tell me what you want

Tell me what you need

A little bit of sugar

A little bit of butter

It's the perfect recipe

Pay day
It'll taste so sweet

Pay day

Good enough to eat

Gonna make some motion pictures

Hit the mall with all my sisters

Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers

Kick it with the music mixers

Buy a ride that suits my style

Lounge around the pool awhile

Make a date with my favorite girl

We've got it made
Woah, we've got to work, work, to work this out
We'll make things right, the sun will shine
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Work this
Gotta work this
We can work this
