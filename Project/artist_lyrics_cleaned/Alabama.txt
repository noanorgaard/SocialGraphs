Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch
We all picked the cotton, but we never got rich
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat
They oughta get rich man to vote like that

Singin'
Song, Song of the South
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone, Gone with the Wind
There ain't nobody lookin' back again

Well, somebody told us Wall Street fell
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell
Cotton was short, and the weeds were tall
But Mr. Roosevelt a-gonna save us all
Well, momma got sick, and daddy got down
The county got the farm, and they moved to town
Poppa got a job with the TVA
We bought a washin' machine and then a Chevrolet

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle-dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh, so right
My Dixieland Delight

White-tail buck deer, munching on clover
Red-tail hawk, sitting on a limb
Chubby old groundhog, croaking bullfrog
Free as the feeling in the wind
Home-grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven
With my Dixieland Delight

Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee byway
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
She's a sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week, got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my Dixieland 

Don't know why
I have to drive so fast, my car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2, oh

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Can't be late
I leave in plenty of time, shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock, oh

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

I hear a voice
It says I'm running behind, I better pick up my pace
It's a race
And there ain't no room for someone in second place

All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
