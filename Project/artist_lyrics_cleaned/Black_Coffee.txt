Can you be my superman?
Can you be my superman?
Can you be my superman?
Can you be my superman?

You know, we don’t have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things
The little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you working late
When you’re out of town
Tell me how much you need it
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together

When I think of you
You make me smile
And I couldn't help it
Hope that this would work
I feel like you've been made for me
You're just too perfect
And the funny thing is
I just can't control myself
I never thought that I could be anyone else
Until you came in to my life
And you showed me there is love
And I think I love you
That's too soon

Superman
