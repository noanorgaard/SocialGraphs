My time ain't long, and it sure ain't free (Waste my time)
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me (Come on, what's the word)
Scared money don't make none, baby, talk is cheap (Waste my time)
If you gonna move it on, do it now, put that loving on me (What's the word)

Is it real or is it phony
There's no need, no time to even be here if I don't have to (Come on, what's the word)
Nigga, don't you play with my money

Hey, baby, hey, baby, to you
It's not right for me to 

Don't want your heart, don't want your love, uh
I want the head, I want the tongue
Who put the pussy in the coffin
Then make it rise to God above?
You would be down on all occasions, uh
I fuck the sense up out your bank
Don't call me Common, call me Crazy
No need to thank me, yours for the taking

And yeah, would you know, would you know it?
Good love in the morning
Only one way to show it
Turn around, let me go in

Let your hair down (Just like this)
Poke your back out (Just like this)
Talk dirty to me (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh, when you do it (Just like this)
Say my name, love (Just like this)
Now pick your legs up (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh, when you do it

And I'm the favourite
Keep on your heels, take off your leggings
Who turned you on, and crawling, begging?
Who told your mum you'd have my babies?
I won't be long, I won't be brief
You at your peak is all I need
Something to hold you for the long run
Come get this awesome, won't you take it off for me?

And yeah, would you know, would you know it?
Good love in the morning
Only one way to show it
Turn around, let me go in

Say, eye contact (Just like this)
Bring your arms back (Just like this)
Take the whole thing (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh, when you do it (Just like this)
Say my name, love (Just like this)
Now pick your legs up (Just like this)
Everything you do, oh, when you do it, yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah, everything you do, oh, when you do it
(Yeah, yeah) Hey!
(Good love)
(Wrong way) Say
(Turn around)
