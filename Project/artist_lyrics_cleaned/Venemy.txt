You'll never see me fall
Watch me reign

And I'll slay them all
I slay them all, I slay 'em all, slay them all
You'll never, you'll never, you'll never
Steal the throne
Reign
And I'll slay them all
I slay them all, I slay 'em all, slay them all
You'll never, you'll never, you'll never
Steal the throne
Throne
King on my own throne, my own throne
Throne, Throne
King on my own throne, throne, throne, throne, throne
