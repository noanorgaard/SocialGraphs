Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No, it's never on the day you leave

Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses

The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from
Being just a number?
How will I hold my head
To keep from going under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through

When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?

1 ContributorDistilled Spirits Lyrics
Nobody can help themselves they’ve got to talk human beings are a bunch of chatterboxes and when we’ve got something in our minds that we want to talk about we talk. Now poetry, though, is the great language, because poetry is the art of saying what can’t be said. Every poet knows this. You’re trying to describe the indescribable, and every poet also knows that nothing is describable. Whether you take a some sort of ineffable mystical experience at one extreme or whether you take an ordinary rusty nail at the other. Nothing is really describable. Those who know do not say, those who say do not know and yet he said that
My house a hermit kingdom, not like North Korea
Got the sweetest, something like Ikea
I'm the king of the court, you needa come to the house, Subpoena
Locked in my vault, something like Aida
Impenetrable answering machine, like I was built by Nokia
Living portable playstation, PSVITA
They stressed out alopecia
My peers seem concerned with the future
They don't live in the present
It'll be here soon enough it's no need for the stressin'
You can't be afraid of time, that's it's greatest weapon
I must admit I've been afraid of hours and seconds
I'm learning to accept it, to join with its presence
Graduated early but life never stopped testin'
Forever dissatisfied, so I just keep on pressin'
Life's a blessing, I work too hard gotta get more rest in
Thought if I'm not going forward, then I must be regressin'
When the world values money over everything
It don’t give a fuck about nothing
Unproductive production, it’s like selective progression
If it ain’t profitable, it ain’t worth discussin'
You might also likeTryna tell me I don’t work enough
Like some natural deodorant
Were tryna skip sleep, like it ain’t a vital component
In order to live in the moment
You gotta rest for a moment
My art exhibits modern issues
Like a display at the MoMA
Used to walk around in a sleep deprived coma
Floating right through my day, wingardium leviosa
Now the vessel of my body filled up with life like I’m Noah
Astute and sagacious
Mentally outrageous
My minds a garden
Protected from hatred
Very encrypted and sacred
Clandestine spaces
For me, life's a never-ending interrogation
Every time I make a discovery they try and barrade and take it
They want mercilessly categorize until they've dissolved the sacred
Leave no leaf unscrutinized leave mystery exposed and naked
Thirst for understanding causes esophagus burning
So much time studying leaves no time for learning
And we wonder why depression lurking?
Always searching, but never certain
Pull back the curtain, find another curtain
For such a blessed world there's a lot of hurtin'
An immense inner world I'm so internal
Makes it hard to overcome my outer-worldly hurdles
I been reconciling with my journal
I'm not really concerned with the realm of the material
Might as well be a vegetable
In another dimension like Tetsuo
Providing magical assistance like Kiki and Totoro
Life’s subjective
I got a real weird perspective
My mind goes on tangents
They tried, they can’t really direct it
I’m eccentric
They never seem to expect it
The human life can be plain
It's hard not to embellish it
Most jobs really suck, they gotta read you all the benefits
I was terribly bad at things
That now they'd call me gifted
Leads me to believe that talent is fictitious
Got a lust for fulfillment
I entrust none with my feelings
I stay up late beyond my expiration date trying to find fulfillment
The best moments in life be the ones where you ain't filmed it
The taste of the food oftentimes better than the nourishment
I just get stuff done never relied on encouragement
When treacheries arise it gets hard to hide my disappointment
Hard to be souple and smooth when I got so many flies in my ointment
Bike rides three in the morning, unpredictable I don’t give a warning
(Ummenumenum Umenah)
Strange sounds grab hold of my ears let go of me
Might have to cut one off out of fear
Might be a lil Van Gogh in me
They take what I do so serious
Man I just write poetry
I ain't got the secret to the mystery
The keys to end all my misery
Don't say it directly just leave hints in my tapestries
Sometimes can't decipher the superficial illusions of fineries
Sometimes don't use proper judgment to solve discrepancies
Let trespassers get the best of me
If the world's my prison cell
I couldn't tell you what I'm in here for
Run-on sentences
Don't know where it ends always lookin' for more
Keep a screen on me like a Teletubby
Trying to rhyme myself back to health
Restoreth my sanity
Trying to reverse the course of time
Trying to push back on reality
The elephant in the rooms wearing a suit, call it Babar
Separation makes people wine call that a decanter
Don't do the talk I'm not into all the chatter
I’m tired of the pressure
Man I needa sequester
Tired of putting myself out there
Feeling like I’m a beggar
Looking for something I can’t find
I don’t feel any better
Inspect your gadget is that thing building bad habits
Do it got your best interests?
Do them companies got the best intent?
Spent all day on my lil entertainment box
Connected to the whole world
Still feel like my communication blocked
Looking at the natural world, feeling like my connection lost
Social media doesn't care that you work minimum wage
And spend most of your time doing stuff you hate
Its sole goal is to keep you entertained
People so busy looking for attention
That they forgot to pay attention
I remember back in school man I miss it
When everyone couldn’t just check out if they didn’t wanna listen
I was stuck in the web like a spider's victim
Broke free of the system
Infinite feed endless consumption
Freedom’s more like free doom these days
Cause all we seem to do with free time is waste it away
You see it was designed this way
The longer you stay the more money is made
I feel things that can't be put into words
I have thoughts that are just images
It’s like patterns
I think about the atmosphere of things
I can feel the themes
I don’t even know how to explain it
Maybe this is what people mean when they talk about vibes
My mind recognizes things that I don’t yet understand
But it still makes sense
Clairvoyance
Get up off your soapboxes
Y'all preaching so much
You need to stop it
Get off your high horse
Throats be getting hoarse
Dudes need a lozenge
Some things can’t get done on yo lil boxes
Keeping up with bullshit that shit is exhaustin'
Every little things a hot topic
So many opinions
I don’t have time for me to process
Sadness on the rise and so is suicide
I ain't no expert so I'm left to theorize
Back when we didn't have happiness at the touch of a button
When you couldn't watch people have sex
To give you a false sense of pride
Phones ain't bad they just addictive
They so convenient it's deceptive
They say social media ain't social at all
Kinda makes sense when I cut that shit out
I started to evolve
Looking back it seems like the means to an end
The less I cared about that shit
The more I cared about my friends
Relationships had time to deepen
I was drowning in surface-level bullshit like the deep end
Weight of the world sits on me like Atlas
The worlds not what I expected its feeling like a catfish
GSE they be unloading all their baggage
Even the weight of the world couldn't make me serious
I don't vocalize all my thoughts so they think I'm mysterious
Feeling like George man I'm so damn curious
Out in the desert of life, scaling the pyramids
So hard to not find self-worth in the approval of others
Ever since a kid, I been a different motherfucker
Announced my album and they thought I was doing covers
Nobody knew I could rap not even my mother
One of those motherfucker rapping under the covers
A closeted rapper yet to be discovered
You ain't gotta worry momma I got it covered
What's the point in living a life without care for others
Become a cash cow they wanna milk you udders
Can't push you to the curb if you came from the gutters
If there was two of me it would over for you suckers
There would be no limit to what I could motherfucker
John, I like your songs but you be saying some weird shit
I said I said what I said and I ain’t fuckin stutter
Writing dope shit just my bread and butter

Schroeder: But you knew you had talent
Bukowski: They all think they have. How do you know that you’re the one? You don’t know. It’s a shot in the dark. You take it, or you become a normal civilized person from eight to five. Get married, have children; Christmas together, here comes Grandma, “Oh, hi, Grandma! Come on in. Hi, you.” You know
Shit, I couldn’t take that, I’d rather murder myself
My taste is getting more obscure
I probably need to talk to people more
I like watching films without narrative or score
Music that's devoid of all musical form
I'm not really good at keeping up a rapport
You could say I'm getting wilder
But I just want my lil house on the prairie
I use words tersely
The girls and their be jukeboxes
Feels like they skip over and play me
I'm an observer of the sexual world
Of the sensual scantily clad acts of soul
My music taste is  impeccable
Leaving the house causing a spectacle
Had to look a few times she too damn beautiful
Yo moms be like, "Oh John he’s very respectable."
Spend most of my time engrossed in thought
That's why when we get together, I don't see much of a need to talk
Life's quite the commitment, it's a full-time job
Mood fluctuating like the stock market
Just yesterday I was at an all-time high
Next, I'm not going to work and we in a depression
Not really tryna talk if you ain't my family or my best friend
This like when you go thru hard stuff but you still be smiling
Life too good it would be a waste to not get a smile in
Tryna rush my artworks
Man that's not how art works
I can write all-day
But I'm trying to make that stuff that make your heart burst
Were attached to what once was
There's a nostalgic influx
Everything these days a redux
All the girls wearing Reeboks
I might just write my stuff in third person
Get someone else to spit the verses
I stay overnight at churches
Wake up make breakfast for the priests
Plant a garden and cook feasts
The world works despite you
The truth is inside you
Thoughts strewn across my head like bookmarks
I may be intelligent but I'm very not book smart
Got knowledge of things you wouldn't expect like Nardwuar
My brain imbued with visions of grandeur
They try to conversate with me end up with one-sided banter
My brain be deleting shit
Me tryna recall the story be like talking to dory
Sometimes in a conversation
The other person will just do the talking for me
Play my cards so close they not sure if I even have any
They don't know how to deal with me
Life's a long compromise
It's measly compared to the world of the mind
Getting lost in the grand scheme of time
I ain't got peace of mind
But I'll give you a piece of my mind
Just a lil piece of mine

Mother earth is grieving

We gon' be the ones leaving
Mother earth gon' be here longer than us
We all die and she remains
Will it take climate change to make the climate change?
We ain’t got time to wait
Now is the time for change
The system is broke
It don’t make any sense
It’s in need of change

Mother earth is grieving

The children know what’s good
They've seen the signs
They've felt the pain
It’s time for change
The revolution was already televised
We’ve seen the destruction
We’ve seen the signs
At this rate, it'll be our demise
We don’t care about your bottom lines
We’ve seen the signs
It’s time for change

Mother earth is grieving

This is large scale corruption
That’s why they don’t do nothing
They gonna act like they ain’t seen it coming
You can’t ignore impending destruction
2020 we shoulda seen it coming
We can get anything shipped at the push of a button
But we can’t stop polluting the ocean?
Feels like everyday I make a lifestyle change
They claim to be something new all they did was a light style change
I can get really happy but eventually, my smile fades
I look at people but they don’t really reciprocate my gaze
Plate full and they still starving
Y'all life hardened
You wasn't this cynical when your life started
I would probably consider myself a lyrical genius
They tryna take the piss out like the end of a penis
Unignorable talent
Artistical prowess
No work-life balance
Don’t fight the flow like a Taoist
The worlds far too callous
But I got thick skin, callus
Sleep on the ground
Don’t need a mattress
I was stuck in the motions
There was too much commotion
I was controlled by emotion
Turbulent like the ocean
I needed devotion
Same old basic notions
My ideas had me floating
But I couldn’t evoke 'em
The same everyday motions
Scared to take action I was frozen
Didn’t know how to approach em
This girl made me open
I get sick roller coastin’
I love it but my head can’t take the motion
I was ramped up I was boastin'
My egos one powerful potion
I was the greatest they was all toastin’
I felt like I was chosen
I felt contrition
My ideas never come to fruition
I'm too cheap to pay for tuition
Said I’m next up they didn't listen
Cooking up like the kitchen
This not premonition or intuition
This just my mission
I got that ambition
I feel like they ain’t wanna pitch in
I'm a point guard the way I be dishin'
This the shit that y'all be missing
It's all part of the system
Y'all don't needa ask for permission
Always looking more stimulation
Wish it was just simulation
Feel like I'm living in an emulation
Bootleg of a more polished version
Scottish warrior rushing into battle
Knew they were dead even before I kilt em
Even before I dipped my pen into the well of thoughts in my brain
Brought 'em to the paper and spilt 'em
My lyrics some real shit that’s why they feel 'em
You gotta find people you can be real with
He doesn’t even know why he writes poems
Mysterious character
Nobody truly knows him
Put pieces of my soul in my poems
My pain versus the worlds like teardrops in the ocean
You ever had a dream where?
Where you could you...
You’d do anything to fulfill it?
That’s that real shit
You don’t know if it’s a good idea
But you'd regret it if you ain’t realize it
Becoming disinterested in the things you so want to love
Realizing you have the perfect life yet that's not enough
Visualizing scenarios that have yet to come
While dwelling in a present that just doesn’t stack up
Life-giving me mixed signals
You gotta keep your head up
But just put your head down
I work long nights I’m in the zone
But no touchdown
Flying high feeling good
Can’t come down
It’s gon be a rough touch down
I don’t pay attention to the news
But I’m more in touch now
It took me so long to accept the now
I remember times when I never thought my life would be this exceptional
Don't ever expect life
Just respect it, wow
My creative process
Made up of eclectic collages
Hectic montages
Word barrages
Impeccable hodgepodges
Manifold collections of concepts
Infused with perfection composites
Fantasy induced erection mirages
In the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge
We resort to professional boxes
And semesters of college
Give up what's left of your vision to impress the all-father
I feel so destined to conquer
I live my life in self-crafted stanzas
Philosophical professions of passion
When I go outside my thoughts expansive
The worlds my canvas
Wanna live to see a new world like a fetus
Say fuck capitalism not gon feed it
Spend my whole looking for meaning
And I'll always keep on dreaming
But it'll never be perfect
So I'll always be scheming
And the kids' gon need feeding
Then they grow up and start forgetting
Get juvenoia and they start reminiscing
Then they return again to being
The ones who need feeding
So we keep on devoting
And we keep on emoting
I see the suffering it's a lot that needs solving
I am at peace with the world
And unite with its evolving
I had no ritual had to make my own
Had no principal had to build a home
They want me to define and package my work
I don't pander to those
Raw emotion, the only thing left when everything else goes
I want people to tell me if my shits wack like Anthony Fantano
They want me to lend them a hand, now I’m feeling like the mano
Going ham getting thin prosciutto
Don’t let 'em strip you of your identity end up like Pluto
Your head lacking growth chemo
My capabilities threefold
Don't you think graffiti makes the city pretty?
Especially if your neighborhood is kinda shitty
Speaking infrastructurally
'Cause we're not lacking in diversity
It’s really just monetarily
Riding through the city like I used to live on this street this street
On a street near me, the police killed a kid named Andy
Since that day I’ve looked at cops differently
I played with toy guns as a kid
But 'cause of my ethnicity
I’m less likely to be a casualty
Of unchecked police brutality
Brutality to put it lightly
I seen the police move like the military
These are humans in your own country
Not the foreign enemy
Is the killing necessary?
I support the troops
But I don’t support the military
Just like I’d support cops if they weren’t killing
Unnecessarily
I don’t condone any killing actually
I have love for every human
I just hate some of them deeply
Every time I think I've figured it out this world brings me to my knees
Begging for just one more day in this reality
But other days I feel like I'm an absentee
Like I'm not even present but they still count on me
Serene on the outside, insides verging on insanity
Confection cavities
Lead to resurrection strategies
Unnecessary casualties
Make you wish you could reset reality
Perplexing fallacies, permeating societies
Waves of melancholy
I'll be better later prolly
Wish this shit would stop happening to me
I may be sitting in my in that room I'm not in that body
Aimlessly wandering carcass lookin' like a zombie
Soul doing somersaults while I'm stuck in place
I'm floating through space
Simultaneously I'm lying flat on my face
Teary eyes induce chromatic abbreviations
Unmanned space station
Satellite disconnected
No point in communication
Sometimes my oddities make it hard to fit in
I don't see the contemporaries as competition
But they ain't got as many bars like free-range chickens
Or when your cellular plans got a satellite missing
I dream up schemes, wrote that last one while sleepin'
Visually impaired doctor
Can't find the cure
Wish I could find my patience
But I see all the way to the end
There's no anticipation
Depression leaves no impression
I Don't know where it's been
It leaves without tellin'
I didn’t expect the person to throw a wrench in my plans would be me
In the fetal position wishing, I could cease to be
Sometimes my searching can get the best of me
Lost soul no rescuing
Wanna forget that I'm me
I just wanna be free
I was having a good time earlier this week
Now everything frosted over and bleak
Fulfillment doesn't exist life will never be complete
So much food I got nothing to eat
So much good, it's means nothing to me
Constant blissful nothingness
Estranged human consciousness
Entangled in a mess of somethingness
Triumphant sadness
Reluctant gladness
Just gotta wallow in the madness
Can’t see my vision clouded with big fears
Dripping big tears
Little cog amongst big gears
I’d go anywhere as long as it ain’t here
As I grow up the people in my life seem to become more and more human
Tryna help each other through a life where we got no idea what we're doing
Flys stuck in the web of life waiting on a death that we all knows coming
Acknowledging your wrongs still don’t make 'em right
That’s why it’s hard to sleep at night
Cheap temporary highs
It's that hollow stuff that'll leave you feeling empty inside
The world so beautiful why we huddled inside?
A constant fog across the eyes
Distracted from our lives
We are never healed just occupied for some time
Looking for the organic in a world obsessed with pesticides
Staring at a blue cloud bank on a orange peachy sky
My blue mind blank stormclouds brewing inside
The beauty of this world brings a tear to the eyes
Explosive chain reactions going off in the field of my mind
Feel like a corrupt memory drive
I need a hard reset
But don't want to lose all the memory inside
Sometimes I don’t even like the things that I write
What’s the point of talking if you ain’t got no insight?
So I keep walking forward with no end in sight
I don’t know where I am
I must be under the skin, right?
I've reached the depths of confusion where the sun don't shine
I've reached the heights of delusion I done lost my mind
Sometimes I came back in shame, sometimes returned with pride
But I've always found something on the other side
Don't believe in talent don't believe in time
'Cause no matter how hard I try
When I wake up in the morning it's like I walk in blind
Seen that even happiness grows sour like limes
It's like we were all bit by the same fatal bug at the start of our lives
And since then the clocks been ticking on our certain demise
Feel like the world ain't got a place for me
Feel like life passing right on by
Try to focus on the little things
Maybe just then I'll be alright
Could care less about the finer things
But I seen every glimmer in your eyes
Tryna tone down the braggadocio 'cause the real world really ain't about that
I live in a shack
If I needed to move it'd take a few minutes to pack
Mind caught in a neverending existential trap
Arm out the window
Hair catching the wind like a dead cat
I’m a conscious cat
Check the discography it's always been about conscious rap
I'm on that peer-reviewed sci-fi philosophical rap
Lying in my bed searching my subconscious for raps
Browsing through my head
Skimming through my library of facts
Searching for bits of data to which my mind can attach
In the pursuit of meaning, I only got more detached
Animal instincts kicking in eyes raining out dogs and cats
My sturdy foundation irrelevant had a roof of thatch
Got everything I wanted but it didn’t last
Feels like everything just a sacrificial offering to the past
Needle in a haystack
Fetal position in my egg sack
Scrambled eggs where your brains at
Education filled the plate of my brain fast
Fuck lent what I need is a brain fast
Removing the brain just might cure the pain fast
They listen to my music expecting a nice melody
And some drums that sound like the sound when a train pass
Little did they know they'd bought a ticket, a train pass
On my train of thought which is now hurtling down the train tracks
The end of this tracks a trainwreck, a train crash

A Modus Vivendi is a way of living it is in your control
A Modus Operandi is a way of operating it is not yours at all
You can decide the way you want to live
But you can’t decide the collective
Influencing the collectives way of operating
That’s the goal, that's 

Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in

So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said, "Help me understand"
He said, "Turn 68, you'll renegotiate"

"Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train"

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing, "Stop this train

               Ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse
           Corporis, et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis;
                "As when the body's health they do it call,
          When of a sound man, that's no part at all."
Epicurus in the stomach;
               Hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus;
          Hc loca circum Ltiti mulcent.
               "For this the seat of horror is and fear,
          And joys in turn do likewise triumph here."
The Stoics, about and within the heart; Erasistratus, adjoining the membrane of the epicranium; Empedocles, in the blood; as also Moses, which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts, because the soul is there seated; Galen thought that every part of the body had its soul; Strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; Qu facie quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est: "What figure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired into," says Cicero. I very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should I alter eloquence itself? Besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. But the reason why Chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; "It is," says he, "because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies I, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach." This place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the Greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. No human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. Why do we fear to say? The Stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. Some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. But the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change.
The extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. The beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch Plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be "a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of Plato."
And what did the Epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? "If the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? Why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of Greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the Iliad?"—"Whatever is capable of reason," says Zeno, "is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason." Cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of Zeno: "The whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise." There are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions.
Whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. I willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. Let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found.
For my part, I am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. This same Plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after Socrates, "That he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand." By this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. They profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. They will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science.
I advised a person in Italy, who had a great mind to speak Italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether Latin, French, Spanish, or Gascon, and that, by adding the Italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either Tuscan, Roman, Venetian, Piedmontese, or Neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. I say the same of Philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. Human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: Nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. "Nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers." And I am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, I know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, "See whence he took it!" My manners are natural, I have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb I went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. I never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher.
But to return to the soul. Inasmuch as Plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. And the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body
                Medium non deserit unquam
          Coeli Phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt.
                "Phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way;
          Yet all things doth illustrate with his ray."
As the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:—
               Ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,
           Paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.
               "The other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er
          The body, does obey the reason's lore."
Some have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:—
               Deum namque ire per omnes
          Terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;
          Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,
          Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:
          Scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri
          Omnia; nec morti esse locum:
               "For God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole
          Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;
          Each at its birth, from him all beings share,
          Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;
          To him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain,
          Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again,
           Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,
           Dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way."
Others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers;
               Instillata patris virtus tibi;
          Fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;
               "Thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood:
          For still the brave spring from the brave and good;"
and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:—
                Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum
          Seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis
          A patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitt artus?
          Si non certa suo quia semine seminioque
          Vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto.
               "For why should rage from the fierce lion's seed,
          Or from the subtle fox's craft, proceed;
          Or why the tim'rous and flying hart
          His fear and trembling to his race impart;
          But that a certain force of mind does grow,
           And still increases as the bodies do?"
That thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children the faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the ill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had been some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory of their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:—
               Si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,
          Cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus,
          Nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?
               "For at our birth if it infused be,
          Why do we then retain no memory
          Of our foregoing life, and why no more
          Remember any thing we did before?"
for, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and purity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of the body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember, being got in the body, as Plato said, "That what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;" a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. Forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. Secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. To say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:—
               Nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,
          Omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,
          Non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.
               "For if the mind be changed to that degree
          As of past things to lose all memory,
          So great a change as that, I must confess,
          Appears to me than death but little less."
Furthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account It had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. Plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. By this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of Epicurus and Democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:—
               Gigni pariter cum corpore, et una
          Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.
               "Souls with the bodies to be born we may
          Discern, with them t' increase, with them decay."
They perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness; capable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and languor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the foot;
               Mentem sanari, corpus ut grum,
            Ceraimus, et flecti medicin posse videmus;
                "Sick minds, as well as bodies, we do see
           By Med'cine's virtue oft restored to be;"
dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some medicaments, and roused by others,—
               Corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est,
           Corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat;
               "There must be of necessity, we find,
          A nature that's corporeal of the mind,
          Because we evidently see it smarts
            And wounded is with shafts the body darts;"
they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability of reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents; the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of Socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge,—
               Vis.... animal Conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum
          Disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno;
               "The power of the soul's disturbed; and when
          That once is but sequestered from her, then
           By the same poison 'tis dispersed abroad;"
and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that Cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:—
              Vis morbi distracta per artus
          Turbat agens animam, spumantes quore salso
         Ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und.
              "Throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease
         Disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas,
         The foaming waves to swell and boil we see,
          Stirred by the wind's impetuosity."
Now, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in a philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled, overturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain.
                Morbis in corporis avius errat
          Spe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur;
          Interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum
         ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti:
         "For when the body's sick, and ill at ease,
         The mind doth often share in the disease;
          Wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by
         A heavy and a stupid lethargy,
         Is overcome and cast into a deep,
         A most profound and everlasting sleep."
The philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more than another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: "The soul is either mortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it will change for the better."—They never touch the other branch, "What if she change for the worse?" and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments. But thereby they make themselves a good game. These are two omissions that I often meet with in their discourses. I return to the first.
This soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and so firm. Our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. As to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal, was unimaginable:—
              Quippe etenim mortale terao jungere, et una
         Consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse,
         Desipere est. Quid enim diversius esse putandum est,
         Aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque,
         Quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni
          Junctum, in concilio, svas tolerare procellas?
               "The mortal and th' eternal, then, to blend,
         And think they can pursue one common end,
         Is madness: for what things more diff'rent are.
         Distinct in nature, and disposed to jar?
         How can it then be thought that these should bear,
         When thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?"
Moreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body:—
         Simul ovo fessa fatiscit:
         "Fatigued together with the weight of years:"
which, according to Zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it "as a fainting and fall of the soul, as well as of the body:" Contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere: and, what they perceived in some, that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire:—
              Non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet gri,
         In nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.
              "So, often of the gout a man complains,
         Whose head is, at the same time, free from pains."
The sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl's eyes are to the splendour of the sun, says Aristotle. By what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? For the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, Cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by Pherecydes
Syrius, in the time of King Tullus (though some attribute it to Thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and
reservation. The most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the Academy. No one doubts what Aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: Rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: "A thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers." He conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself.
Two things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful
repute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as Plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. Man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. He has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. The soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. But 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: Somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: "They are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher," says one of the ancients. By which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. All things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'Twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that God wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of Babel. Whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. We corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. What course soever man takes of himself, God still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed Nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; Perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent." The diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? This saint has very much obliged me: Ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio "The very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption." To what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly!
But to return to my subject. It was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to God only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. Let us ingenuously confess that God alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. And whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. The more we give and confess to owe and render to God, we do it with the greater Christianity. That which this Stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from God? Cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. Utor hc public persuasione. "When we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. I make use of this public persuasion." Now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. Let us omit the Stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. "They give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. The most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make Pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: "That souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that Euphorbus, afterwards Hermotimus, and, finally, from Pyrrhus was passed into Pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. And some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:—
              O pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est
         Sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti
          Corpora? Qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido?
                "O, father, is it then to be conceiv'd
         That any of these spirits, so sublime,
         Should hence to the celestial regions climb,
          And thence return to earth to reassume
          Their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb?
          For wretched life whence does such fondness come?"
Origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate. The opinion that Varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; Chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. Plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from Pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. Observe her progress elsewhere: "The soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with." But I will not omit the objection the Epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. For the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? Or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive.
              Denique comrabia ad Veneris, partusque ferarum
         Esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur;
         Et spectare immortales mortalia membra
         Innumero numro, certareque prproperanter
          Inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter.
              "Absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget,
         Or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait,
         Expect the falling body, fight and strive
         Which first shall enter in and make it live."
Others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. Some make it immortal, without
sense or knowledge. There are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. "We are told," says he, "and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end." But who desires to see him—him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, I refer him to his treatise of the Moon, and of the Demon of Socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. See here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul.
Neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. Let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. Let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. Archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite Socrates was, according to Aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; Pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; Plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; Alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; Democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; Epicurus, an extract from soul and body; Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. Now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? Aristotle and Democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. Galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. Here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, "For what term women carry their fruit?" and I, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. The world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree.
Here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part We have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? Quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. "As if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own." In earnest, Protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. When Thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible.
You,* for whom I have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your Sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'Tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as Gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of Persia, Darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill Gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,
         * The author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing
          Margaret de Valois.
though he should run them both through at once. I have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. The Portuguese, in the Indian Sea, took certain Turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. We here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. Keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. Remember the Tuscan proverb:—
          Chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza.
         "Who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool."
I advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; I am an enemy to all extravagant ways. You, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. But here is as much as you will stand in need of.
Epicurus said of the laws, "That the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another." And Plato affirms, "That without laws we should live like beasts." Our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'Tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. It is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. And yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. In earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. Wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. And therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. But if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company.
The liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. But now that men go all one way, Qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, "Who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve," and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. In like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. We need to know no more but that Mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of Venus in the thumb, and that of Mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. I leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies.
Theophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'Tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, I do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, I lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him,
               Ut hymettia sole
         Cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas
          Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;
              "As wax doth softer in the sun become,
          And, tempered 'twixt the finger and the thumb,
         Will varions forms, and several shapes admit,
         Till for the present use 'tis rendered fit;"
as much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that the difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as little; for 'tis nothing but my own.
Man is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as Theophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once surrender all the rest of his knowledge; if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. Non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:
"One thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same." Now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. If we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy,
         Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troj stabat Apollo;
         "Vulcan against, for Troy Apollo stood;"
when are we to expect that they will be agreed? We are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. If man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? It is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood.
The Academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. And to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. The Pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect This appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? How should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? Either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot If our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: Inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: "Amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind." That things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. Now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that I seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men.
Let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, I mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number.
Besides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. How variously do we judge of things?—How often do we alter our opinions? What I hold and believe to-day I hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; I could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than I do this; I am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which I have since judged to be false? A man must at least become wise at his own expense; if I have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can I now have more than at other times? Is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? Nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all.
    Posterior.... res ilia reperta
         Perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne.
         "The last things we find out are always best,
          And make us to disrelish all the rest."
Whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it The things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if God for this end did not prepare it, if God did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. At least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived.
Now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. It is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. Are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? Do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? Do you believe that Catullus's verses, or those of Sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? Cleomenes, the son of Anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; "I believe it," said he; "neither am I the same man now as when I am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before." In our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, Gaudeat de bon fortun ; "Let him rejoice in his good fortune;" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. That venerable senate of the Areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. The very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in Cicero:—
              Tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse
         Jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras.
              "Men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air,
         Dark or serene, as days are foul or fair."
'Tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,—the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that I believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.
As to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. I always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. How uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.
I, that watch myself as narrowly as I can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere,
              Quis sub Arcto Rex gelid metuatur or,
         Quid Tyridatem terreat, unice Securus,
              "I care not whom the northern clime reveres,
         Or what's the king that Tyridates fears,"
dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness I find in myself My foot is so unstable and unsteady, I find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, I am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, I am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, I am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. The same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: I am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. I have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either I am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, I am as merry as a cricket. When I take a book in hand I have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, I may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. Even in my own writings I do not always find the air of my first fancy; I know not what I would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because I have lost the first that was better. I do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams:—
              Velut minuta magno
         Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.
             "Like a small bark that's tost upon the main.
         When winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain."
Very often, as I am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that I no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it I am, as it were, misled by the side to which I incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. Every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as I do. Preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. You only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. Have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. Nay, I do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. The shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. And whoever should maintain this, siding with the Peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. Valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; Semper Ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; "Ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice.
Irregular desires moved Themistocles, and Demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. And this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of God, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! In short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. May not this be one of the reasons that moved the Epicureans to discharge God from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? Ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: Sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. "As it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it."
What varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! What assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? If our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it?
Is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? We better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. The two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep.
This is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. I was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'Tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. But does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed?
I, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. But the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. I have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for I am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; I perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was, wholly to seize and possess me. So that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; I evidently saw the advantages of the object I desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, I was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? Pyrrho knows nothing about it. We are never without sickness. Agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as I had advanced, so much I retired:—
              Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,
         Nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam
         Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;
         Nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens
         Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.
              "So swelling surges, with a thundering roar,
         Driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore,
         Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land,
         And far upon the beach heave up the sand;
         Then backward rapidly they take their way,
         Repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea."
Now, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, I have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as I am not capable of choosing, I take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein God has placed me; I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. Thus have I, by the grace of God, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. The writings of the ancients, the best authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that I am reading seems always to have the most force; and I find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. The facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. The heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till Cleanthes the Samian, or, according to Theophrastus, Nicetas of Syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. And Copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? And who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former.
              Sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum:
         Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;
         Porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,
         Inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum
         Laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.
               "Thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time,
          What now is valued passes soon its prime;
         To which some other thing, despised before,
          Succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;
         And once received, too faint all praises seem,
         So highly it is rais'd in men's esteem."
So that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. Before the principles that Aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. What patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? They are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. When any one presses me with a new argument, I ought to believe that what I cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. He that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. How long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'Tis said that a new comer, called Paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. I believe he will easily make this good, but I do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. We are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. A man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if I would give him the hearing. After I had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: "What, then," said I, "did those that sailed according to Theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?" "That's fortune," answered he, "but so it is that they were mistaken." I replied that I had rather follow effects than reason. Now these are things that often interfere with one another, and I have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as Jacques Pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. Ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been Pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. The geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:—
         Nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;
         "What's present pleases, and appears the best;"
but it remains to be seen whether, as Ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? And whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine.
Plato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west The Egyptian priests told Herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; Aristotle and Cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling Solomon and Isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that God has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. In the most famous of the Greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. Heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. And Apuleius says of men: Sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. "That they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general." Alexander writ to his mother the narration of an Egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. Cicero and Diodorus say that in their time the Chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, Aristotle, Pliny, and others, that Zoroaster flourished six thousand years before Plato's time. Plato says that they of the city of Sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of Athens was built a thousand years before the said city of Sais; Epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the West Indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples.
In earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, I have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. The human mind is a great worker of miracles! But this relation has, moreover, I know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and Lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of St Andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. In one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the Spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one God, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:
"From dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;" as also the art of augury. The vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. It is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. And this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. But to proceed:—
If nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? If we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: Et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: "The climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also," says Vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of Athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the Egyptian priests told Solon: Athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur Attici; crassum Thebis; itaque pingues Thebani, et valentes: "The air of Athens is subtle and thin; whence also the Athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at Thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the Thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong." In such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why Cyrus would not grant the Persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. If we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? Seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so?
Methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. Let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:—
              Quid enim ratione timemus,
          Aut cupimus? Quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te
         Conatus non poniteat, votique peracti?
              "For what, with reason, do we speak or shun,
         What plan, how happily soe'r begun,
         That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?"
And therefore it was that Socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private and public prayer of the Lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the Supreme Power:—
              Conjugium petimus, partumqu uxoris; at illis
         Notum, qui pueri, qualisque futura sit uxor:
              "We ask for Wives and children; they above
         Know only, when we have them, what they'll prove;"
and Christians pray to God, "Thy will be done," that they may not fall into the inconvenience the poet feigns of King Midas. He prayed to the gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; his prayer was heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers.
              Attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque,
         Effugere optt opes, et, qu modo voverat, odit.
              "Astonished at the strangeness of the ill,
         To be so rich, yet miserable still;
         He wishes now he could his wealth evade,
         And hates the thing for which before he prayed."
To instance in myself: being young, I desired of fortune, above all things, the order of St. Michael, which was then the utmost distinction of honour amongst the French nobles, and very rare. She pleasantly gratified my longing; instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and lower. Cleobis and Bito, Trophonius and Agamedes, having requested, the first of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of their piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us. God might grant us riches, honours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us. If he sends us death, or an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, Vvrga tua et baculus, tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. "Thy rod and thy staff have comforted me," he does it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it in good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand
              Si consilium vis:
         Permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid
         Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris...
         Carior est illis homo quam sibi;
              "If thou'lt be rul'd, to th' gods thy fortunes trust,
         Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just.
         What best may profit or delight they know,
         And real good, for fancied bliss, bestow;
         With eyes of pity, they our frailties scan,
         More dear to them, than to himself, is man;"
for to require of him honours and commands, is to require 'that he may throw you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of the like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit doubtful.
There is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers, as about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the calculation of Varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. Qui autem de summo bono dissentit, de tot philosophies ratione disputt. "For whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme good, disputes upon the whole matter of philosophy."
              Trs mihi conviv prope dissentire videntur,
         Poscentes vario mul turn divers a palato;
         Quid dem? Quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet alter;
         Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus;
              "I have three guests invited to a feast,
         And all appear to have a different taste;
         What shall I give them? What shall I refuse?
         What one dislikes the other two shall choose;
         And e'en the very dish you like the best
         Is acid or insipid to the rest:"
nature should say the same to their contests and debates. Some say that our well-being lies in virtue, others in pleasure, others in submitting to nature; one in knowledge, another in being exempt from pain, another in not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances; and this fancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient Pythagoras,
              Nil admirari, prope res est una, Numici,
         Solaque, qu possit facere et servare beatum:
              "Not to admire's the only art I know
         Can make us happy, and can keep us so;"
which is the drift of the Pyrrhonian sect; Aristotle attributes the admiring nothing to magnanimity; and Arcesilaus said, that constancy and a right inflexible state of judgment were the true good, and consent and application the sin and evil; and there, it is true, in being thus positive, and establishing a certain axiom, he quitted Pyrrhonism; for the' Pyrrhonians, when they say that ataraxy, which is the immobility of judgment, is the sovereign good, do not design to speak it affirmatively; but that the same motion of soul which makes them avoid precipices, and take shelter from the cold, presents them such a fancy, and makes them refuse another.
How much do I wish that, whilst I live, either some other or Justus Lipsius, the most learned man now living, of a most polite and judicious understanding, truly resembling my Turnebus, had both the will and health, and leisure sufficient, carefully and conscientiously to collect into a register, according to their divisions and classes, as many as are to be found, of the opinions of the ancient philosophers, about the subject of our being and manners, their controversies, the succession and reputation of sects; with the application of the lives of the authors and their disciples to their own precepts, in memorable accidents, and upon exemplary occasions. What a beautiful and useful work that would be!
As to what remains, if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the rules of our manners, upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves! For that which our reason advises us to, as the most likely, is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of Socrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel; and by that, what would it say, but that our duty has no other rule but what is accidental? Truth ought to have a like and universal visage; if man could know equity and justice that had a body and a true being, he would not fetter it to the conditions of this country or that; it would not be from the whimsies of the Persians or Indians that virtue would receive its form. There is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the laws; since I was born, I have known those of the English, our neighbours, three or four times changed, not only in matters of civil regimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed with, but in the most important subject that can be, namely, religion, at which I am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with whom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and acquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our ancient kindred; and here with us at home, I have known a thing that was capital to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise, according to the chance of war, in a possibility of being one day found guilty of high-treason, both divine and human, should the justice of our arms fall into the power of injustice, and, after a few years' possession, take a quite contrary being. How could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine Being, and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of their own contrivance, useful as a bond to their society, than declaring as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every one's true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he chanced to be? O God, what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign Creator, for having disabused our belief from these wandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the eternal foundation of his holy word? But what then will philosophers say to us in this necessity? "That we follow the laws of our country;" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; I cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. What kind of virtue is that which I see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? What sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them?
But they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest Now they are so unfortunate, (for what can I call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, I say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. Now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. But let them produce me one of this condition. Proctagoras and Aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; Thrasymachus, in Plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. There is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in Lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:—
              Gentes esse ferantur,
         In quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti
         Jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;
              "There are some nations in the world, 'tis said,
         Where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed;
         And their affections thereby higher rise,
         More firm and constant by these double ties;"
the murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other.
It is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: "Therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art." Subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view.
There is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. It is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms.
Lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods.
Dionysius, the tyrant, offered Plato a robe of the Persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; Plato refused it, saying, "That being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;" but Aristippus accepted it with this answer, "That no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage." His friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that Dionysius had spit in his face, "Fishermen," said he, "suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon." Diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, "If thou couldst live on cabbage," said he, "thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;" to whom Aristippus replied, "And if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages." Thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:—
              Bellum, o terra hospita, portas:
         Bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur.
         Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti
         Quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;
         Spes est pacis.
         "War, war is threatened from this foreign ground
               (My father cried), where warlike steeds are found.
         Yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,
         And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
         Peace may succeed to war."
Solon, being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and unprofitable tears for the death of his son, "It is for that reason that I the more justly shed them," said he, "because they are powerless and unprofitable." Socrates's wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance: "Oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death!" "Why," replied he, "hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?" We have our ears bored; the Greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. We retire in private to enjoy our wives; the Indians do it in public. The Scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere temples were a refuge:—
               Inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum
         Odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos
         Esse deos, quos ipse colit.
              "Thus 'tis the popular fury that creates
         That all their neighbours' gods each nation hates;
         Each thinks its own the genuine; in a word,
         The only deities to be adored."
I have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt Bartolus and Aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties, writ in the margin of his book, "a question for a friend;" that is to say, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit 'Twas only for want of wit that he did not write "a question for a friend" throughout. The advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. In so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. Of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause.
As to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. Arcesilaus said, "That in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:" Et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas Epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... Queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. "And obscene pleasures, if nature requires them," Epicurus thinks, "are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... Neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved." These last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that Dicarchus threw into the teeth of Plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom.
Laws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'Tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,
that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. Do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. It is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. Chrysippus said, "That a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives."
That philosopher would hardly have advised Clisthenes to have refused Hippoclides the fair Agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. Metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till Crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the Peripatetics, of which he had been till then. That which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the Stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of Venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. Modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. Pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. Hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:—
              Mochus es Aufidi, qui vir,
         Scvine, fuisti:
         Rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.
          Cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor?
         Numquid securus non potes arrigere?
This experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:—
              Nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet
         Uxorem gratis, Cciliane, tuam,
         Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens
         Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.
A philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, "I am planting man;" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic.
It is, I suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the Cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. But he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for Diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. To those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, "Because I am hungry in the open street." The women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and Hipparchia was not received into Crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. These philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others.
Heraclitus and Protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.
This opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! What heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'Tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. A person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the Bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science.
By this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. There is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the Sibyls, say what he will. There are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. Let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;—a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. This it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.
Is it possible that Homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? Whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'Tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was Homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. And what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. Do but observe how Plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. From the same foundation that Heraclitus and this sentence of his had, "that all things had in them those forms that we discern," Democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,—"that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The Pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. The Cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat Protagoras believed that "what seems true to every one, is true to every one." The Epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. Plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation.
This discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and Prof of our ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:—
                Via qua munita fidei
          Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;
              "It is the surest path that faith can find
         By which to enter human heart and mind."
Science begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:—
               Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam
          Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....
           Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?
              "Of truth, whate'er discoveries are made,
          Are by the senses to us first conveyed;
         Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what
         Can we rely more safely than on that?"
Let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: "O miserable! thy force has destroyed thee." There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty.
The first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'Tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:—
                 An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures
            Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?
          An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?
                "Can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?
           Or is that touch by tasting to be check'd?
          Or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes
           Confute in their peculiar faculties?"
They all make the extremest limits of our ability:—
               Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,
              "Each has its power distinctly and alone,
         And every sense's power is its own."
It is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.
I have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. They brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, "Good God," said he, "what a fine child! How beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!" He will say, like one of us, "This room has a very fine prospect;—it is clear weather;—the sun shines bright." And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. One cries out to him, "Here's a hare!" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, "The hare is killed," he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide.
Who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'Tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. If we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. We have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.
The sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: "That every subject has in itself all we there find. That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;" and that of the Epicureans, "That the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:—"
                Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,
         Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:
              "But be it what it will in our esteems,
         It is no bigger than to us it seems:"
that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:—
              Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....
         Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:
              "Yet that the eye's deluded we deny;
         Charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:"
"and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses." Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. The most absurd of all absurdities, with the Epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:—
                  Proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est
            Et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,
            Cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint
            Visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem
            Beddere mendose causas utriusque figur,
           Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam,
            Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota
            Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:
            Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa
           Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,
            Procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint
           In genere hoc fugienda.
                "That what we see exists I will maintain,
          And if our feeble reason can't explain
            Why things seem square when they are very near,
            And at a greater distance round appear;
           'Tis better yet, for him that's at a pause,
          'T' assign to either figure a false cause,
          Than shock his faith, and the foundations rend
         On which our safety and our life depend:
         For reason not alone, but life and all,
         Together will with sudden ruin fall;
         Unless we trust our senses, nor despise
         To shun the various dangers that arise."
This so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him. He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say be true, viz: "that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;" and if that also be true which the Stoics say, "that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge," we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.
As to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. In the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:—
              Exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,
         Classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem
         Apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens
         Insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...
         Et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,
         Qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....
         Ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit
         Flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur
         Vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.
               "And rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head,
         Though far disjoined, though royal navies spread,
         Their sails between; yet if from distance shown,
         They seem an island all combin'd in one.
         Thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,
         Seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail
         That ride at anchor safe; and all admire,
         As they row by, to see the rocks retire.
         Thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,
         And I look'd downward on the rolling flood;
         Though he stood still, I thought he did divide
         The headlong streams, and strive against the tide,
         And all things seem'd to move on every side."
Take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—"That the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue." There is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say "that the voice was the flower of beauty." One would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, "I break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine." To what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? And that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'Tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from Spain, and this pearl-powder from the Ocean Sea. Our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:—
               Auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur
         Crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.
         Spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:
         Decipit hac oculos gide dives Amor.
               "By dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades
          Make up the pageant that your heart invades;
          In all that glittering figure which you see,
         The far least part of her own self is she;
         In vain for her you love amidst such cost
         You search, the mistress in such dress is lost."
What a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make Narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow,
              Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;
         Se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;
         Dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:
              "Admireth all; for which to be admired;
         And inconsiderately himself desir'd.
         The praises which he gives his beauty claim'd,
         Who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:"
and Pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman!
              Oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,
         Et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;
         Et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.
              "He kisses, and believes he's kissed again;
         Seizes, and 'twixt his arms his love doth strain,
         And thinks the polish'd ivory thus held
         Doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,
         And has a timorous fear, lest black and blue
          Should in the parts with ardour press'd ensue."
Put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him on the top of the high tower of Notre Dame at Paris; he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; Ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: "'To that one cannot look without dizziness;" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: Fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, "For it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear." Physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at Rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind.
The same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:—
               Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.
              "Thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns."
The object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is;
              Multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus
         Esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;
              "Hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress
         Seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;"
and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. Our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts?
               In rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,
         Si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni
         Tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot:
               "Nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind
         Take heed, unless she sets herself to find,
         The thing no more is seen, no more belov'd,
         Than if the most obscure and most remov'd:"
it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood.
They who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and Cimmerian darkness. We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?
If the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. Our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:—
              Tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,
          Ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.
         Spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv,
         Disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:
               "And in those things the difference is so great
         That what's one's poison is another's meat;
         For serpents often have been seen, 'tis said,
         When touch'd with human spittle, to go mad,
         And bite themselves to death:"
what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? By which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for?
Pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the Indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them. Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? To them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:—
              Lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur Arquati.
               "Besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view
         Looks pale as well as those, and yellow too."
They who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody. What do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. If we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:—
               Bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...
         Et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina.
              "One lamp seems double, and the men appear
         Each on two bodies double heads to bear."
If our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. We see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:—
              Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,
         Et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,
         Per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;
         Namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem
         Scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque
         Inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:
              "Thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,
         O'er all the spacious theatre are spread,
         Which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,
         And the loose curtains wanton in the air;
         Whole streams of colours from the summit flow,
         The rays divide them in their passage through,
         And stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:"
'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes.
We should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. A child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do our senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. Shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,—whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:—
                Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,
        Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;
                "As meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose
        Their former state, and different things compose;"
the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? He whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:—
                 Denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima,
         Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,
         Et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum;
        Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,
        Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;
        Jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque
        Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;
        Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,
        Falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est.
                "But lastly, as in building, if the line
        Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,
        Or level false, how vain is the design!
        Uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall
        Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,
        Because the rules were false that fashion'd all;
        Thus reason's rules are false if all commence
        And rise from failing and from erring sense."
As to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was.
To judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they who never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.
We have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. So, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. Plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that Homer had made the Ocean and Thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, Parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. Pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the Stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; Heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; Epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:—
             Mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas,
        Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;
        Nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,
        Omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit.
            "For time the nature of the world translates,
        And from preceding gives all things new states;
        Nought like itself remains, but all do range,
        And nature forces every thing to change."
"And yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as Heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? How comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? For it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. For time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. And as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. So that it were sinful to say of God, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that God alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end." To this so religious conclusion of a pagan I shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: "What a vile and abject thing," says he, "is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!" 'Tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. He shall be exalted, if God will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. It belongs to our Christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous

5.	INTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR
The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.

6.	INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR
From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.
The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.
7.	INTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR
From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.
NORM
Yeah, you want to watch it.
SHAKE
(unhappily)
It's not my fault.
NORM
Well, you stick to that story, son.
SHAKE
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
GRANDFATHER
(To NORM slyly)
They always say that.
NORM
Yeah, well I got me eye on you.
SHAKE
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller
than you.
NORM
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
(he is about to thump SHAKE.)
JOHN
(enjoying himself)
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
NORM
He started it.
SHAKE
No, I didn't you did ...
GEORGE
Well, what happened?
SHAKE
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
PAUL
And?
NORM
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
PAUL
I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
NORM
Y'what?
PAUL
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.
PAUL
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
GEORGE
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
NORM
You're right. Here you are, old devil.
SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.
GRANDFATHER
Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?
PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.
JOHN
Come on let's get this coffee.
GRANDFATHER
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.
GEORGE
(coyly)
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
JOHN
(invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice)
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
PAUL
(choked)
I'll murder you, Grandfather!
JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.
GEORGE
Eh, look at that talent.
They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.
JOHN
Give 'em a pull.
PAUL
Shall I?
GEORGE
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
PAUL
Now what's that supposed to mean?
GEORGE
(grinning)
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
JOHN
George Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.
We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.
PAUL
(in posh accent)
Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.
The two girls giggle together.
JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.
GRANDFATHER
(sternly)
I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.
JEAN
Prisoners!!
GRANDFATHER
Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.
THE BOYS
Y'what!!!
GRANDFATHER
Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.
(He points at Ringo)
That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.
RINGO
(protesting)
Now look here!!
GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.
GRANDFATHER
Get out while you can, ladies, his time's
coming round for one of his turns.
The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.

8.	INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.
NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.
NORM
He's been gone a long time.
SHAKE
(without looking up)
Who?
NORM
Paul's grandfather.
SHAKE
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
NORM
Down the ... er ...
SHAKE
Oh, down the ... er ...?
NORM
Yeah, down the ... er ...
SHAKE
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.
9.	INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT
Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.
GRANDFATHER
(proudly)
Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.
LADY AUDREY
Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?
GRANDFATHER
Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.
AUDREY
Of course, John.
GRANDFATHER
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
AUDREY
The usual ten per cent?
GRANDFATHER
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
AUDREY
(her eyes lighting up)
How fascinating. Do go on ...
(pause)
... John.
GRANDFATHER
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
10.	INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.
NORM
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
JOHN
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
NORM
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
PAUL
(accusingly)
Have you lost him?
NORM
Don't exaggerate.
PAUL
You've lost him.
SHAKE
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
PAUL
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
SHAKE
He can't be far.
JOHN
I hope he fell off.
PAUL
(mildly)
Don't be callous.
RINGO
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
GEORGE
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
RINGO
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.
11.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.
She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.
RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.
He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: "Who, me?"
TANIA smiles enthusiastically.
GEORGE has been watching all this.
GEORGE
Are you going in?
RINGO
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
GEORGE
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
RINGO
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.
12.	INTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.
PAUL
Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?
The girls jump up, surprised.
JOHN
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!
(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)
Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
PAUL
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
He starts to drag JOHN after him.
JOHN
I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.
JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.
JOHN
I bet you can guess what I was in for.
He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.
A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.
PAUL
How about that one?
He moves towards the compartment.
PAUL
(to Ringo and George)
Did you look in here?
GEORGE
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
PAUL
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
PAUL opens the door of the compartment.
13.	INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.
GRANDFATHER
(looking up)
Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.
PAUL enters and crosses over to him.
PAUL
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
GRANDFATHER
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
PAUL
Oh, well that's all right.
(realising)
What?
AUDREY
Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.
PAUL
I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.
(He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.)
I'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!
AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.
AUDREY
Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?
A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.
PAUL
(pulling)
Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.
AUDREY
(pulling)
You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!
JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.
JOHN
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
GEORGE
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
RINGO attempts to interfere.
RINGO
Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ...
AUDREY
Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.
RINGO
Y'what?
She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.
RINGO
He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.
RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.
A voice shouts off from outside.
VOICE OFF
That's one of them ... stop thief!
14.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR
From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by  three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.
Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.
RINGO
(looking down at the handbag in his hand)
Oh Mother!!
15.	INTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN
Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.
In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.
GRANDFATHER
(bitterly)
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
PAUL
Don't dramatise.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.
PAUL
Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.
GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.
PAUL
Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.
GRANDFATHER turns away again.
PAUL
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
GRANDFATHER
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
PAUL
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
GRANDFATHER
(cutting in)
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
PAUL
Yeah ... so what?
GRANDFATHER
Why do you always use your left hand?
PAUL
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
GRANDFATHER
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of
the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.
PAUL
Shove up!
GRANDFATHER produces a penny.
GRANDFATHER
Odds or evens?
PAUL sighs.
PAUL
Odds.
GRANDFATHER flips the coin.
The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.
JOHN
(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
PAUL
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.
(to Ringo)
Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
RINGO
Me? Why?
GEORGE
Bag-snatcher.
GRANDFATHER
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
JOHN
(casually)
Every morning.
JOHN has been looking around the guards' van.
JOHN
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...
(he pats the dog)
'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.
(he shudders)
Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
PAUL
Like what?
JOHN
Well, I've got me gob stopper.
(he produces his mouth organ.)
Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.
16.	EXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)
While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.
17.	EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)
SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.
18.	INTERIOR  GUARDS VAN
By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.
NORM enters the guards' van.
NORM
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
JOHN
Please, can I have one to surge with?
NORM
No.
JOHN
Ah, go on, you swine.
NORM
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
He points and we see a big car parked across the road.
The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.
19.	EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS
Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.
NORM
Oh no!
GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.
GRANDFATHER
All right, lads, follow me.
And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.
JOHN
Vive l'amour!
NORM drags him away.
20.	EXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION
The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.
The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.
21.	INTERIOR  BIG CAR
NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.
NORM
(to the driver)
Go like the clappers, son!
FRANK
(smoothly)
That was my entire intention, sir.
22.	EXTERIOR  STATION
The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.
It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.
23.	INTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT
There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.
RINGO
I don't snore.
GEORGE
You do - repeatedly.
RINGO
(to John)
Do I snore?
JOHN
(eating a banana)
You're a window rattler, son.
RINGO
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
PAUL
(stopping playing)
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
GRANDFATHER
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
PAUL
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
GRANDFATHER
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.
NORM
Paul, John, George - get at it.
JOHN
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.
RINGO
None for me, then?
NORM
Sorry.
John hands RINGO a single envelope.
JOHN
That'll keep you busy.
GRANDFATHER
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
RINGO
You go and pick on your own.
SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.
JOHN
Is that yours?
SHAKE
For Ringo.
He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.
JOHN
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
GEORGE
He comes from a large family.
RINGO
(dumping the letters)
Well.
RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.
RINGO
Eh, what's Boyd's Club?
The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.
PAUL
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey"--that's you--"in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
RINGO
(surprised)
And they want me?
JOHN
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
NORM
(snatching the card)
Well you're not going.
RINGO
Ah.
GRANDFATHER
(taking card from Norm)
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
He pockets the card himself.
RINGO
That's mine.
NORM
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
BOYS
Why?
NORM
It's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot
(he indicates the fan letters)
all answered tonight.
The BOYS all protest.
NORM
I'll brook no denial!
JOHN
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
NORM
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their
penmanship.
He goes followed by SHAKE.
There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.
JOHN
While the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?
With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.
GRANDFATHER
What about all these letters?
BOYS
Read 'em!
They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.
C.U. GRANDFATHER
GRANDFATHER
And a free champagne buffet.
He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit.

24.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT
The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement
by all the other customers. During this scene we
CUT AWAY
25.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT
The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur "suivez" and "banco" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.
DEALER
Alors, M'sieur?
GRANDFATHER
(nonchalant)
Souflée.
He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.
GRANDFATHER
I bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!
CROUPIER
Pas "Bingo," M'sieur... Banco.
GRANDFATHER
(taking)
I'll take the little darlings anyway.
He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.
GRANDFATHER
Two and one is three, carry one is four.
The buxom BLONDE leans over him.
BLONDE
Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER
(disturbed by his eyeline)
Eh?
BLONDE
Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER
We'd be thrown out.
BLONDE
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
He does so.
CROUPIER
Huit à la pointe... et sept.
(He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)
BLONDE
You had a lovely little pair, y'see.
GRANDFATHER
I did?
CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).
BLONDE
They're yours.
GRANDFATHER
They are?
BLONDE
The cards... you're bank.
26.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB
The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.
27.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB
GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.
GRANDFATHER
Bingo!
CROUPIER
(wearily)
M'lord dit "Bingo."
WAITER
(to Grandfather)
A little light refreshment.
GRANDFATHER
(lordly)
A glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.
(He resumes his game.)
Souflée, chop chop.
The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.
28.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB
The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.
From their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.
29.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S
GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.
30.	INTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM
Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says "The manager!" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:
NORM
Now get on with it.
JOHN
We were going to do it.
NORM
Aye, well, now!
(He goes through bedroom.)
RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.
RINGO
Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard?
ALL
A man? No.
RINGO
Well somebody did.
GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.
GEORGE
He's right, y'know.
BOYS
(disinterested)
Ah well, there you go.
SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.
SHAKE
Eh, what's all this?
PAUL
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
JOHN
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
SHAKE
(to WAITER)
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
WAITER
The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.
PAUL
No!
RINGO
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
PAUL
(turning on Ringo)
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
JOHN
Well, what are we waiting for?
SHAKE
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours
is worse than any of you lot.
31.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S
GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.
WAITER
Encore de champagne, Monsieur?
GRANDFATHER
Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.
He takes another swig of his glass.
MANAGER
(beaming)
Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.
CUSTOMER
Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.
The MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.
MANAGER
Play is about to resume, m'lord.
GRANDFATHER
(handing him a chip)
Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.
He takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.
32.	INTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.
ATTENDANT
I'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN
I've got to get in.
It's urgent and important.
I've had an invite.
Take me to your leader.
NORM
Shurrup.
The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.
NORM
All we want to know is have you got a little
old man in there?
MANAGER
(pleasantly)
Do you mean Lord McCartney?
CLOSE-UP PAUL
PAUL
He's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...
BLONDE
(standing next to Grandfather)
Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.
JOHN
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
GRANDFATHER
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.)
They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the
entrance desk. They then go to settle up.
MANAGER
(with false charm)
Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.
He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.
NORM
(taking it)
I'll settle that.
He glances at it.
NORM
A hundred and eighty pounds!
MANAGER
(icily)
I beg your pardon, guineas.
At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.
WAITER
Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety
pounds.
The MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.
GRANDFATHER
How about me change?
MANAGER
Cloak room charge.
He hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.
RINGO
(brightly)
Ah well, easy come, easy go.
The others glower at him.
RINGO
Well.
33.	INTERIOR  BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS)
The BOYS have settled down.
JOHN
Should I say it?
GEORGE
Follow your impulse.
RINGO
It'll only get you into trouble.
JOHN
(to RINGO)
Aah, shurrup, misery!
JOHN slouches forward.
JOHN
(urgently)
O.K. Driver, follow that car!!
The driver  is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.
FRANK
(indicating the traffic)
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
JOHN
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
FRANK
Sorry?
(meaning: "I beg your pardon.")
GEORGE
Oh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.
FRANK
I see.
JOHN
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
FRANK
Oh, yes, now I'm with you.
But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
The car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.
JOHN
Ever seen one of these before?
FRANK
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
JOHN
I see you go to the night court.
FRANK
I've made the scene.
JOHN
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
GEORGE
I don't think that bit's right.
JOHN
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?

34.	EXTERIOR  STREET
As the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.
RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. "Ole" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which
has just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.
35.	INTERIOR  CAR
NORM
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
JOHN
(as Ringo and Paul climb in)
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
FRANK
(to Norm)
We're nearly there, sir.
JOHN
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
CLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.
NORM
And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know
why I left.
36.	EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE
Which has been converted to the T.V. studios.
There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.
The car approaches.
37.	INTERIOR OF THE CAR
NORM
Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.
JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.
At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.
38.	INTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars
and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.
FIRST P.R.O. MAN
(menacingly)
Press conference, they're waiting for you.
NORM
(jovially)
Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath.
FIRST P.R.O. MAN
(more menacingly)
They're waiting now!
And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.
PAUL
Eh this lot means it. They're even taking
hostages.
The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.
39.	INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM
It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..
Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.
Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:
SOUND REPORTER
What's your philosophy of life?
JOHN
I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.
REPORTER
Has success changed your life?
RINGO
Yes.
REPORTER
Do you like playing the guitar?
GEORGE
Next to kissing girls it's favourites.
PAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.
PAUL
No, actually, we're just good friends.
HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.
40.	INTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE
The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.
PAUL
(ironically)
Anything to spare?
GRANDFATHER
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
GEORGE
Sure.
(He does so).
PAUL
Ah well. Eh, look!
He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.
PAUL
Let's go and muck in.
JOHN
Aye, before anyone stops us.
They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.
41.	INTERIOR  STAGE
Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:
VOICE
Here, what about these electric guitars?
SHAKE
Where are they?
VOICE
Back here, mate.
SHAKE
(going towards the voice)
I'm coming.
RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.
RINGO
Leave them drums alone.
FLOOR MANAGER
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
RINGO
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm
out on strike.
FLOOR MANAGER
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
RINGO
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
FLOOR MANAGER
Spoil sport!
RINGO
Well!
RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.
GEORGE
He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.
RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.
PAUL
What's up?
GEORGE
(pointing)
He's sulking again.
JOHN
I'll show him.
He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.
42.	INTERIOR  RAMP
As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.
DIRECTOR
(with over-exaggerated calm)
All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.
By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.
JOHN
Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?
DIRECTOR
Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting "a musical arranger" who would question my ability ... picture-wise.
JOHN
(to the others)
I could listen to him for hours.
PAUL
Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?
DIRECTOR
Mr. McCartney Senior!
The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.
GRANDFATHER
Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.
DIRECTOR
(bravely)
I'm quite happy to be replaced.
GRANDFATHER
(indicating the director)
He's a typical buck-passer.
DIRECTOR
I won an award.
JOHN
A likely story.
DIRECTOR
It's on the wall in my office.
At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.
NORM
Hello our lot, everyone happy?
The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.
NORM
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
DIRECTOR
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.
DIRECTOR
Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's
all a plot.
They go left towards the back-stage.
NORM
(producing key)
Now, come on, I've got the key.
He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.
NORM and the BOYS turn on him.
NORM
Let's have you.
JOHN
Come on speedy!
PAUL
Ringo!
GEORGE
Wake up!
RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading "Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves." The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.
GRANDFATHER
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.
He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out "10" on his sign, and writes "9" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.
43.	INTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR
The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.
JOHN
(to actor)
Gear costume!
ACTOR
(eyeing him)
Swap?
NORM
Right, first floor and no messing about.
NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, "after you," "No, after you." NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.
NORM
Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.
The BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.
44.	INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR
RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.
45.	EXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.
The BOYS scamper down the fire escape.
When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.
From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.
It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.
They look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.
The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.
MAN'S VOICE
(off)
I suppose you know this is private property.
The boys freeze.
From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.
JOHN
Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.
46.	INTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE
GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.
47.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE
Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.
The menacing shadows appear on the stairway.
NORM (voice off)
There's no one here.
SHAKE (voice off)
This is the only way they could have gone.
We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.
48.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE
A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.
Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.

48A.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM
JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.
MILLIE
(as all pass)
Hello.
JOHN
(stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her)
Hello.
MILLIE
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
JOHN
No, not me.
MILLIE
(insistently)
Oh you are, I know you are.
JOHN
No, I'm not.
MILLIE
You are.
JOHN
I'm not, no.
MILLIE
Well, you look like him.
JOHN
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
MILLIE
Oh you do, look.
JOHN looks at himself in the mirror.
JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.
JOHN
My eyes are lighter.
MILLIE
(agreeing)
Oh yes.
JOHN
And my nose...
MILLIE
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
JOHN
Is it?
MILLIE
I would have said so.
JOHN
Aye, but you know him well.
MILLIE
(indignantly)
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
JOHN
(knowingly)
That's what you tell me.
MILLIE
(suspiciously)
What have you heard?
JOHN
(blandly)
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
MILLIE
Is it? Is it really?
JOHN
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
MILLIE
I knew I could rely on you.
JOHN
(modestly)
Thanks.
MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.
MILLIE
You don't look like him at all.
JOHN winks at her and she winks back.
49.	INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM
NORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.
SHAKE
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
NORM
That's too easy for Lennon.
He crosses to door leading to fire escape.
NORM
(dramatically)
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
SHAKE
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
NORM
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
SHAKE
But John hasn't got any.
NORM
What?
SHAKE
Nerves.
NORM
I know, that's the trouble.
He puffs nervously at his cigarette.
NORM
Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.
He hears something.
NORM
Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!
The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.
JOHN
What are you doing there?
SHAKE
Hiding.
JOHN
I think you're soft or something.
NORM
We weren't hiding.
TAILOR
Now?
NORM
Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?
RINGO
Well ...
NORM
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
JOHN
(down on his knees)
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
NORM
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting
for you in the studio.
RINGO
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
NORM
Good lad, Ringo.
PAUL
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
GEORGE
You crawler.
JOHN
He's betrayed the class.
RINGO
Oh, leave off!!!
JOHN
Temper! Temper!
RINGO
Well ...
CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.
NORM
Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for
you!
By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.
JOHN
I now declare this bridge open.
The BOYS run out the door.
50.	INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA
Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.
From the door off stage, above which is a sign "To Canteen and Production Offices", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and
three. He goes to be measured with the sweater.
From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.
We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.
We hear the DIRECTOR's voice.
DIRECTOR (V.O.)
All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.
We
CUT TO
centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.
The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.
We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.
51.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.
DIRECTOR
Where are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?
FLOOR MANAGER
(placating)
They're coming, I promise you.
DIRECTOR
(fiercely)
Now look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!
Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.
1st STAGE HAND
What's he on about, Taff?
WELSH STAGE HAND
Well ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.
At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.
JOHN
(to the director)
Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?
The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.
DIRECTOR
(to himself)
Of course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.
RINGO
Are you as young as that, then?
BOYS
Shurrup!
GRANDFATHER
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
PAUL
(to Shake)
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
SHAKE
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
PAUL
(threateningly)
I'll set John on you!
SHAKE
(hastily)
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
He leads GRANDFATHER away.
The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it.
DIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy)
Run through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.
The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare.
52.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.
DIRECTOR
That was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...
(to make-up woman)
Oh how about make-up?
MAKE-UP WOMAN
Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.
DIRECTOR
Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?
NORM
(rising)
Sure.
DIRECTOR
(looking into the monitor)
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
From the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.
53.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
PAUL
(to Ringo)
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
RINGO
(briefly)
You were twanging too loud.
JOHN
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
GEORGE
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
RINGO
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
JOHN
Since you ask, yes.
(he laughs)
Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.
RINGO
Well!
JOHN
He'll get over it.
NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.
NORM
All right, our lot, make-up.
54.	INTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM
A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.
SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.
SHAKE
You blinked!
GRANDFATHER
I never did, you did.
The BOYS enter.
SHAKE
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
GEORGE
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the
champ here.
He indicates RINGO who ignores him.
NORM
Stop picking on him.
RINGO
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
JOHN
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
NORM
Sit down, the lot of you.
At this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.
Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of "aye aye's" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.
HEAD MAKE UP GIRL
Oh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time.
ACTOR
Well, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.
(sees John with beard)
And who's me, then?
JOHN
(charmingly)
My name's Betty...
(pointing to the name on the mirror)
Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic?
NORM fights his way to JOHN.
NORM
Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.
SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of "Queen" Magazine.
NORM
(to Ringo)
What do you think are you're up to?
RINGO
Someone put it on me.
JOHN
Excuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.
The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.
JOHN
You won't interfere with the basic rugged
concept of my personality, will you, girl?
PAUL
Eh, don't take out me lines.
GEORGE
Yeah, they give him that "Je ne sais quoi"
rakish air.
The lads laugh with pleasure.
RINGO decides to try a little joke.
RINGO
(indicating the busby he is still
wearing)
Short back and sides, please.
The other look at him with mock disgust.
PAUL
Behave...
JOHN
Foreign devil ...
GEORGE
Control yourself...
GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.
GRANDFATHER
In my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.
JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.
JOHN
You know you're only jealous!
And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance.
NORM
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
JOHN
You wouldn't!
NORM
I would though.
NORM goes out.
PAUL
What's he know?
JOHN
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
GRANDFATHER
(impatiently)
Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.
GIRL
(admiringly)
What a clean old man.
GRANDFATHER
(touchingly)
You're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.
JOHN
He's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.
NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.
NORM
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
JOHN
(jumping from his seat)
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
JOHN'S GIRL
I don't think its allowed.
JOHN
Well ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!
The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.
The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.
As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the "Strauss" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.
JOHN
(passing him)
Never.
During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.
55.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS  they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.
56.	INTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM
The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.
We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.
So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.
When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.
57.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR
DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY
Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.
The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.
NORM is on them at once.
NORM
That was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.
JOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.
JOHN
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
PAUL
(grabs a showgirl)
So's mine.
NORM
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.
JOHN
(like a pig)
Oink! Oink!
They dash off with the two beauties.
GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.
GRANDFATHER
I want me cup of tea.
NORM
Shake.
SHAKE
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
NORM
Clever.
(he turns)
George.
But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.
NORM turns to RINGO.
NORM
Look after him.
RINGO
But...
NORM
Do I have to raise me voice?
RINGO
(choked)
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.
57A.	INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE
A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.
GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.
We
CUT TO
THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.
58.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN
The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.
GRANDFATHER
(disgustedly to no one in particular)
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
RINGO
Well ... what's the matter with that?
GRANDFATHER
(taking the book from him)
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
RINGO
(snatching back his book)
You can learn from books.
GRANDFATHER
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
RINGO
Out where?
GRANDFATHER
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
RINGO
(defiantly)
Books are good!
GRANDFATHER
(countering)
Parading's better!
RINGO
Parading?
GRANDFATHER
(marching up and down the canteen)
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
RINGO
Well, I am living, aren't I?
GRANDFATHER
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
RINGO
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
GRANDFATHER
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
RINGO
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
GRANDFATHER
So you are a man after all.
RINGO
What's that mean?
GRANDFATHER
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
RINGO
(not too sure)
Oh ... I dunno.
GRANDFATHER
(confidingly)
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
RINGO
Yeah ... that's right.
GRANDFATHER
And what's it all come to in the end?
RINGO
(defensively)
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
GRANDFATHER
A book!
RINGO
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
He throws the book down.
GRANDFATHER
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
RINGO
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
GRANDFATHER
(nodding)
You're only right.
RINGO
(nodding back)
I'm not wrong.
There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.
GRANDFATHER
Where are you off to?
RINGO
I'm going parading before it's too late!
RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.
59.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY
RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.
GEORGE
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
RINGO
(passing him)
No. I don't.
As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.
RINGO
You want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.
60.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE
JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.
JOHN
Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.
RINGO looks at JOHN hard.
PAUL
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
RINGO
(with simple dignity)
Get knotted!
PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.
PAUL
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
JOHN
Can't he? He's done it, son!
GEORGE runs towards them.
GEORGE
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
PAUL
We do.
GEORGE
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
PAUL
He hasn't.
GEORGE
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
PAUL
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
The three of them go into the street.
61.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.
PAUL
We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.
They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.
JOHN
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
GEORGE
I'll look in here again.
PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.
62.	EXTERIOR  STREET
RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying "We Buy Anything" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.
RINGO
Hello.
GIRL
Get out of it, short house!
CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.
63.	EXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL
RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.
POLICEMAN
Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.
Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.
RINGO
(shouting after him)
Southerner!
He looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.
BOY
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
RINGO
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
BOY
Oh don't be so stroppy!
RINGO
(getting up)
Well! A boy of your age bowling "hoop" at people. How old are you anyway?
BOY
(aggressively)
Nine.
RINGO
Bet you're only eight and a half.
BOY
(countering swiftly)
Eight and two thirds.
RINGO
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
BOY
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
RINGO
Shurrup!
BOY
I bet you're
(searching for an age)
-- sixteen!
RINGO
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
BOY
Well --
RINGO
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
He moves off and the BOY follows.
BOY
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
RINGO
Y'what?
BOY
You heard, it gets on my wick.
RINGO
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
BOY
I'm a deserter.
RINGO
(smiling in spite of himself)
Are you now?
BOY
Yeah, I've blown school out.
RINGO
Just you?
BOY
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
RINGO
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
BOY
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come
with us but they chickened.
RINGO
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
BOY
(sighing)
Yeah.
RINGO
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
BOY
(defensively)
Oh, it's all right.
RINGO
(disbelievingly)
Yeah?
BOY
Yeah.
RINGO
What they like?
BOY is glad to have something to talk about.
BOY
(enthusiastically)
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
RINGO
How about Ding Dong?
BOY
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.
BOY
Why aren't you at work?
RINGO
I'm a deserter, too.
BOY
Oh.
At this moment a child's voice shouts out "Charley" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.
BOY
(to Ringo)
See you.
The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.
64.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE
GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying "Canteen and Production Office Opposite." He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters  building.
65.	INTERIOR  OFFICE
It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.
SECRETARY
Oh, there you are!
GEORGE
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
SECRETARY
(tartly)
You haven't, you're just late.
(She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.)
Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
GEORGE
Is he?
SECRETARY
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.
(She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.)
Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.
(she smiles)
Of course, right away.
She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.
SECRETARY
Well ... come on.
GEORGE
Sorry.
He follows her quickly in.
66.	INTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE
A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.
Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, "Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."
SECRETARY
(proudly)
Will this do, Simon?
SIMON
(looking at George)
Not bad, dolly, not really bad.
(he motions to George)
Turn around, chicky baby.
GEORGE does so.
SIMON
Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.
(he indicates the girl on the poster)
All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.
GEORGE
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
SIMON
(sharply)
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
GEORGE
I'm afraid I don't understand.
SIMON
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
SECRETARY (anxiously)
Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.
SIMON
They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.
He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.
SIMON
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
GEORGE
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
SIMON
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.
(to secretary)
Can he read?
GEORGE
Of course I can.
SIMON
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
GEORGE
I'll have a bash.
SIMON
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
GEORGE
Ta.
SIMON
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.
SIMON
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
GEORGE
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
SIMON
Grotty?
GEORGE
Yeah, grotesque.
SIMON
(to secretary)
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
GEORGE
But I won't.
SIMON
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
GEORGE
I don't care.
SIMON
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
GEORGE
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
SIMON
(playing his ace)
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
GEORGE
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
SIMON
I beg your pardon?
GEORGE
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
SIMON
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
GEORGE
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
SIMON
Get him out of here!!
GEORGE
(genuinely surprised)
Have I said something amiss?
SIMON
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.
GEORGE
(smiling)
Sorry about the shirts.
He is ejected through the door.
SIMON
Get him out.
(he stops in mid-shout)
You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
SECRETARY
You mean an early clue to the new direction?
SIMON
(rummaging in his desk)
Where's the calendar?
(he finds it)
No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!
67.	EXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER
The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.
68.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.
GRANDFATHER
I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.
DIRECTOR
If he says that again, I'll strike him.
SHAKE
(unconvincingly)
They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.
DIRECTOR
(disgusted)
Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.
GRANDFATHER
I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.
NORM
(grimly, C.U.)
God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.
69.	INT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR
CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.
BARMAID
(accusingly)
That was fresh this morning.
We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.
Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.
BARMAID
(to Ringo)
That'll be two and nine...
RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs
away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.
BARMAID
Right ... On your way!
RINGO
Y'what?
BARMAID
You heard, on your way, troublemaker!
Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...
70.	EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB
RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.
71.	EXTERIOR  STREET
PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, "TV Rehearsal Room." As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.
72.	INTERIOR  HALL
PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.
73.	INTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM
PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.
GIRL
If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.
She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.
GIRL
(surprised)
Oh!
PAUL
(enthusiastically)
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
GIRL
Go away! You've spoilt it.
PAUL
Oh, sorry I spoke.
He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.
GIRL
Are you supposed to be here?
PAUL
I've got you worried, haven't I?
GIRL
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
PAUL
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
GIRL
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
PAUL
(ironically)
How'd you guess?
GIRL
(seriously)
Oh, it's the way you talk.
PAUL
(innocently)
Is it ... is it, really?
GIRL
(suspiciously)
Are you pulling my leg?
PAUL
(looking her straight in the eye)
Something like that.
GIRL
(unsure)
I see.
(airily)
Do you like the play?
PAUL
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.
(smiles to himself)
Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
GIRL
Gear?
PAUL
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
GIRL
Thank you.
PAUL
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
GIRL pouts.
PAUL
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
GIRL
(cutting in)
I'm not ...
PAUL
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
GIRL
No.
(aggressively)
I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
PAUL
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
GIRL
Yes.
PAUL
Aye, I knew you were.
GIRL
What's that mean?
PAUL
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....
(he imitates her)
"I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
GIRL
(dryly)
The big hammer?
PAUL
(smiling)
Oh aye, a sledge.
GIRL
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
PAUL
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
He moves and stands about like an actress.
GIRL
But that's not like a real person at all.
PAUL
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
GIRL
They ought to be.
PAUL
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
GIRL
(teasingly)
What are you?
PAUL
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
GIRL
I bet you don't sound like real people.
PAUL
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
GIRL
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
PAUL
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio
PAUL
... all this and a jam butty too!!
GIRL
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
PAUL
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
GIRL
Why selfish?
PAUL
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
She looks at him in surprise.
PAUL
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
GIRL
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
PAUL
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
GIRL
Is she?
PAUL
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...
(Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg)
Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
GIRL
(shattered)
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
PAUL
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
He laughs.
GIRL
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
PAUL
(grinning)
And cunning.
GIRL
And what do you do about it?
PAUL
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
GIRL
Pity.
PAUL
(not noticing the invitation)
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
GIRL
Yes.
PAUL
(going)
See you.
GIRL
Of course.
PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.
74.	EXTERIOR  STREET
In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.

77.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR
The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.
NORM
Worry, will you!
SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.
DIRECTOR
(bitterly)
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
NORM
I'll murder that Lennon.
DIRECTOR
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
SHAKE
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
NORM
Shurrup, cheerful.
The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.
DIRECTOR
You don't think...
NORM
(reassuring him)
They'll be here.
DIRECTOR
Oh now, they can't do that to me.
(turning on Norm)
It's all your fault.
(overriding Norm)
Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
SHAKE
(helping out)
... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.
He steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.
NORM
Traitor!
SHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.
SHAKE
Of course.
At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.
JOHN
(as he passes by)
Hi Norm!
NORM
(preoccupied)
Hi, our lot!
The BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.
NORM
Our lot!
GEORGE
(mildly)
Did you want something.
NORM
(beaming with delight)
I could eat the lot of you.
JOHN
You'd look gear with an apple in your gob.
DIRECTOR
(accusingly)
Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through?
GEORGE
Sorry.
SHAKE
Eh, there's only three of them.
PAUL
Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.
DIRECTOR
Do you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.
JOHN
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
NORM
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Everyone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.
PAUL
Eh, where's my grandfather?
NORM
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
PAUL
Aye, I suppose so.
They run after the others.
78.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP
GRANDFATHER
Here they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!
The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: "Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs." On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.
79.	INTERIOR  POLICE STATION
It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.
RINGO
Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...
POLICEMAN
Sure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.
SERGEANT
What is he?
POLICEMAN
(reeling off the list)
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
SERGEANT
Oh, a little savage, is he?
POLICEMAN
A proper Aborigine.
RINGO
(on his dignity)
I demand to see me solicitor.
SERGEANT
What's his name?
RINGO
Oh, well if you're going to get technical --
At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.
SERGEANT
Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?
(to policeman)
Sit Charley Peace down over there.
The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.
GRANDFATHER
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.
(kicks the nearest policeman)
Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
SERGEANT
Is there a fire, then?
GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.
GRANDFATHER
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
SERGEANT
Eh?
GRANDFATHER
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
SERGEANT
What's he on about?
GRANDFATHER
(squaring up)
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
SERGEANT
(to policemen)
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.
GRANDFATHER
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
RINGO
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
GRANDFATHER
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
RINGO
What?
GRANDFATHER
(whispering)
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
RINGO
(disturbed)
Have they?
GRANDFATHER
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
RINGO
(horrified)
Me!
GRANDFATHER
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
RINGO
(hopefully)
Oh, they seem all right to me.
GRANDFATHER
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
SERGEANT
(calling)
Would you two like a cup of tea?
GRANDFATHER
You see, sly villains.
RINGO
(miserable)
No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.
We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.
SERGEANT
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
POLICEMAN
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
SERGEANT
Well, he can't stop here.
Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.
RINGO
What are you doing?
GRANDFATHER
Lip reading.
RINGO
What are they saying?
GRANDFATHER
Nothing good.
The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.
GRANDFATHER
Well son, it's now or never.
He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.
GRANDFATHER
All right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.
He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.
SERGEANT
Now, what's he up to?
RINGO
He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.
The POLICEMAN with the photos returns.
POLICEMAN
(Irish accent)
Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.
RINGO
Turncoat!
The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.
CLOSE-UP  RINGO
RINGO
Mother!
80.	EXTERIOR  STREET
GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.
CLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face.
GRANDFATHER
Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!
He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.
They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.
81.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CONTROL ROOM
DIRECTOR
(watching the clock)
Only half an hour and you're on!
GEORGE
Can I say something?
The director clutches at any straw.
DIRECTOR
(hopefully)
Yes, anything.
GEORGE
(earnestly)
It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....
But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.
82.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR
The four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the
security guard.
GUARD
(going back into theatre)
I'll have the hides off of you lot.
The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.
GUARD
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!
GRANDFATHER
I must see Pauly.
GUARD
Go home then and see him on the telly.
The GUARD re-enters the stage door.
GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.
GRANDFATHER
Can you fix him for me?
BOYS
Yeah.
GRANDFATHER
Sixpence.
BOY
Each?
GRANDFATHER is about to argue.
GRANDFATHER
Oh, all right.
BOY
And in advance.
GRANDFATHER
(disgusted)
Mercenary!
But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.
83.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE
GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.
84.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM
The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.
DIRECTOR
(shouting)
It's all right, leave him alone.
PAUL
Grandad, where's Ringo?
GRANDFATHER
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
BOYS
The police station.
GRANDFATHER
He'll be pulp by now.
JOHN
What are we waiting for?
GEORGE
Come here.
PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.
CLOSE-UP DIRECTOR
DIRECTOR
We've only got twenty minutes.
85.	EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION
PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.
86.	INTERIOR  POLICE STATION
The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.
SERGEANT
What is all this?
JOHN
(heaving and panting)
Hold on until we get our breath.
The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.
SERGEANT
All right now?
JOHN
Sure.
(to boys)
Ready?
The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.
87.	EXTERIOR  STREET
THE CHASE CARRIES ON.
Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.
JOHN
Ah well, it was worth a try.
INSPECTOR
(calling to Sergeant)
What do you think you're up to?
SERGEANT
Arrest those boys, sir.
INSPECTOR
That's all we need to start a real riot!
(to Boys)
Come on lads, they're waiting for you.
###	INTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE
The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.
DIRECTOR
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
NORM
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.
PAUL
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
GRANDFATHER
Here, Pauly.
And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.
PAUL
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
JOHN
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
PAUL
(hotly)
What's old got to do with it?
JOHN
You needn't bother.
PAUL
Y'what?
JOHN
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
PAUL
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
JOHN
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.
JOHN
You see.
(to Grandad)
You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
GRANDFATHER
(fighting back)
But I'm clean.
The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.
88.	INTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM
We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.
89.	INTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR
NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.
NORM
I've got the stuff. Come here.
PAUL
Aren't we ...
NORM
No, we're not!
He hurries them along.
NORM
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
JOHN
Tonight? We can't make it ...
NORM
You've got a midnight matinee.
JOHN
Now, look here, Norm ...
NORM
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
JOHN
What?
NORM
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.
90.	EXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE
The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.
PAUL
(looking behind him)
Where's my grandfather?
NORM
(arriving at helicopter door)
Don't start. Look.
The boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.
GRANDFATHER
(beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos)
Come on, you're hanging up the parade.
The boys shout "Get rid of those things, etc."
91.	EXTERIOR  FIELD
The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.
We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over 

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar

Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

What is there more to learn
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return
