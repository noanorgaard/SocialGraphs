Louiee baby 'bout to lay that pipe down (Are you ready?)
And that pussy wet, a nigga might drown
Fendi man, I'ma splash, I go fast, I won't crash
Feel like The Incredibles, all this ice, watch me dash
And this flow on your ass, and your flow, that shit trash
Call me Steph, my shit gold, your shit green, no splash
Change the flow, they like, "Louiee how you do that?"
I lost control 'cause you know that ass too fat
Ayy, but I'ma fuck you every day, every day
You got a nigga in the way (what the fuck?)
I'ma find out where he stay
Click, bow, Lysol, we gon' spray with that K
They don't...

I can see us in Atlanta right now (Right now)
Actin' brazy, tell that nigga pipe down (Pipe down)
You was bad so I had to bite down (Bite)
Bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down
Yeah you know they waitin' on us right now (Right now)
Everybody hatin' on us like, how? (How you do that?)
So you better tell that nigga pipe down (Pipe)
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
You might also like
Pull up on you niggas, lights out
Gettin' to the money right now
Think you fly, we gon' shoot your flight down
You can... bite down, bite down, bite down
Diamonds in my Rollie, iced out
When I hit the mall, don't look at the price now
Monty, I'm a boss, lil' nigga, pipe down
I be with some niggas and them niggas type wild
I can see me in a Phantom right now (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
OT with the hammer right now
Throwin' Gs on some dancers right now
They be hatin' on a nigga like how? Monty!

I can see us in Atlanta right now (Right now)
