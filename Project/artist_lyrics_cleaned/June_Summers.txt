All my smokers, get high with me
Just Marley and me
If you smoking on your kush or your Sour D (Light it)
Just some ride with me
Now salute (Yeah, yeah)
You can puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute (Ooh, ooh, riiight)
To all my potheads across the globe

I roll up something; nah, I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink; like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink—let's go
I smoke a zone, playing P3
My nigga Sheist got that E.T., got a nigga sleepy
Yeah, I used to coast down posts
Looking real nonchalant, then sail off the autobahn
You go to copping, don't get more than one
I go to copping and they throw me some—it's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shout-out to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones, come on

To all my potheads across the globe

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed—I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, but no
I'm smoking weed that tastes like...
... Kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said, "Fuck it," bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season, and it's
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push?
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit so no one can see
Then, I make it safely, grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it
All my smokers get high with me

Now salute (Ooh, ooh)
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights: black, aqua, and grape
These niggas tryna duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog coming and run away
Bitches fall through the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '80 AZ-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high, I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive—do it all with grace
For the kush, I got a jones, like Grace
I call my house "First" 'cause "First" is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me
Just Marley and me

Now salute (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
To all my potheads across the globe
Smoke fills the room, as soon as I put my two boat shoes in
Then I'm floating in... slow motion
Know my M.O
Always roll with homegrown, same color as Leno
It's widow-white, yeah, my eyes lower than pebbles
I get in the zone, you know I flowing in forever
There's never no effort, forget it, the memory's been severed
Why take the shaky shit when I can give it to you fresher?
Yes, sir, that's Asher, chilling in a sweatshirt
Smoking on some shit that they be giving to the lepers
Nonetheless, I'm an open-mind accepter
Respecter of the cess, yes, collector of the best herb
I smoke weed, no need to give a lecture
Still can't believe it's illegal, for the record
The way I see it, it makes me think better
Sink in deep and make me think that I'll
Release the feet beneath of me and let the weed just speak to me
Hear it in the beat: I see it leaking from the frequency
And frequently, a freak like me figures out the secrecy
Feels the need to plant the seed in each and every human being
Cocaine and E will only take away your decency
Caffeine and nicotine, secretly, can weaken me
Can't you see the key ingredient? It be the THC
 That sativa's all you need

All my smokers get high with me
Just Marley and me
If you smoking on your kush or your Sour D (Light it)
Just come ride with me
Now salute (Yeah, yeah)
You can puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute (Ooh, ooh)
