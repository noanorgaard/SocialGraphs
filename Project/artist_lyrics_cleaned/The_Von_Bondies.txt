When my teeth bite down I can see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve, 'cause 'now' is gone
Things were good when we were young

Is it safe to say? (C'mon, c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (C'mon, c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (C'mon, c'mon)
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)

As I make my way, c'mon, c'mon
Through these battered nights that seem too long
Now we grieve, 'cause 'now' is gone
Things were good when we were young

When my teeth bite down I can see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve, 'cause 'now' is gone
Things were good when we were young

Is it safe to say? (C'mon c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (C'mon c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (C'mon c'mon)
(C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)

Is it safe to say? (C'mon c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (C'mon c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (C'mon c'mon)
(C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)

And on this day, these deepened wounds
Don't heal so fast, can't hear me croon
Of a million lies that speak no truth
Of a time gone by, the 'now' is
