I told God we ain't tryna get shot, but roll cops
In them co-ops fillin' the pores like Botox
$kinny the boss of robots
It's somethin' you cosign, it's somethin' you can't cop
And I'm, I'm just cruisin' down the block
When the summer's hot, in the drop top let the wheels pop
6-4s filled with mascots
See that's couple of bad hoes, that's hoes with ass shots
And I'm sittin' on 2's

We smokin' weed up under the moon
Floatin', we just under influence
With hoes and I don't know what you're doin'
And I'm just tryna win from the knots of my top locked
Duckin' from the shots of a Glock for my have-not
So many we burn slow, tryna talk down on me
But my watch so Rollie and my croc grow holy

And I'm smokin'
Smokin'
Just me and my niggas
That's the gunshots
That's the gunshots
You better duck, nigga!

Mama said stop chasin' the guap
Go to college, chase some knowledge
But my classroom full of alcoholics
So I stay high, 'bouncin' like 4s on 'drolics
But I try, yeah I try, I try
But the weed kept callin' like get high, get high
Overseas kept callin' like oh God, oh God
And Visine keep us in, nigga, eyes so bright
And I'm sittin' on 2s

We smokin' weed up under the moon
Floatin', we just under influence
With hoes and I don't know what you're doin'
And I'm just tryna win from the knots of my top locked
Duckin' from the shots of a Glock for my have-not
So many we burn slow, tryna talk down on me
But my watch so Rollie and my croc grow holy

And I'm smokin'
Smokin'
Just me and my niggas
That's the gunshots
That's the gunshots
You better duck, nigga!
Oh, oh shit, you hear these gunshots, nigga? Fuckin' crazy! Mothafucker get downstairs, look at this shit!
Look at this shit!
Oh my God, you done smoked too much
Oh shit!
Yo, that $kinny nigga's
