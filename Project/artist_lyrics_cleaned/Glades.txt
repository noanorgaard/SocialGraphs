And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

Freeze time when we align
Our love won't be confined
No way that the eye can hide
Till my blood runs dry
You might also like
And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart

I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to
