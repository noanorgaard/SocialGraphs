Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in

You'll see you go nowhere, so new you appear
Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings, kiss you goodbye

Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine

Of the mind with no hope

I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
And come undone
Pleasantly cavin' in
I come undone

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more livin' life behind a shadow
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more livin' life behind a shadow

You whisper secrets in my ear
Slowly dancin' cheek to cheek
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
They say I'll only do you wrong
But come together 'cause I understand
Just who you really are, yeah, baby
