Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na

We used to swim in these rivers, plant seeds in the dirt
Or BMX to the creek or we would surf
Climbing up that oak tree outside of church
Felt that summer breeze - peace on earth
We sprayed up the canals and turned them to nice walls
And I was allowed to return home when it's nightfall
This was the life that our ancestors died for
As we enter the era of drone wars and cyborgs
A generation like an alien life force
(We gon' build it up)

Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life, a golden age is in sight
Cut the greed of our time, reminisce, generations align
(We gon' build it up)
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life, a golden age is in sight
Cut the greed of our time, reminisce, generations align
(Fists up high, build it up)

Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Fists up high, build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Fists up high, build it up)

We used to swim in these rivers, fish in the harbour
But now sins of the father they got us living their karma
I used to leave the house open, cars unlocked
Now a camera lens is scoping every yard of my block
I used to roam with mates and play sports
Now judges let paedophiles walk, kids are forced to stay indoors
I used to conversate with bro's, mates to the end
Now we type on iPhones to Facebook friends
We used to protest and face committing a crime
But now it's just an internet petition we sign
We used to break up fights, blood spills (you lose)
Now a guy smacks a girl and we film it for Youtube
(We gon' build it up)

Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life, a golden age is in sight
Cut the greed of our time, reminisce, generations align
(We gon' build it up)
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life, a golden age is in sight
Cut the greed of our time, reminisce, generations align
(Fists up high, build it up)

Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Fists up high, build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (Fists up high, build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na na (We gon' build it up)
Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life (Come on come on, we're gon' watch it all burn)
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life (Yeah! We gon' build it up)
Flowers lie on the graveside of modern life (Come on come on, we're gon' watch it all
