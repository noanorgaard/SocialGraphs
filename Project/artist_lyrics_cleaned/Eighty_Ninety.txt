If I could go back to the foot of your bed
Well I would, memorize every word that you said
And I would really notice the weight of your head
Feel it rise and fall with every breath
And we would, go lay out on the roof of my car
And we would, try to point to your favorite star
And we could take for granted just how lucky we are again

And you gotta be brave
And you gotta be strong
Didn’t you say that’s what I was
Didn’t you say you loved me...cause, well...
If I’m downtown it’s probably half past three
Thinking about if you think about me
If you’re with someone new you met
And if you ever did kick them cigarettes
When I’m a little drunk, I get outta line
