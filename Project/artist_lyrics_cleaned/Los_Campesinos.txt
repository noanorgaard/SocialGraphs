Any more tears for the birthing pool?
Bear this child directly into misery
Kiss him in the face with no lips and no tongue
But with your little, middle, index and ring fingers
Singing, "I see songs in shapes and colours (So let's move )
Not nuclear physics or pottery ovens (All day, the  boys and DJs)
Fluid lines that soar like towers (Everybody go get down tonight)
Patterns reformed just like child actors" (Do what you like)

Plunge your hand, rip out my spine
Replace it with a UV light
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected

These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman
Than you will ever, ever be

So stick with your instincts, stick with the imprints
With the hieroglyphics that the fan club sent us
And roll with the toppers, the slow steady choppers
Bat with your eyelids and lose it with your stutter
Go ba-ba-ba-la-ba-ba-ba-da-ba, ba-ba-ba-la-ba-ba-ba-da-ba, honey, hey! (So let's move , all day, the  boys and DJs)
I'm taking far too many chances (Everybody go get down tonight)
On these less than idealistic romances (Do what you like)

Plunge your hand, rip out my spine
Replace it with a UV light
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected

These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman
Than you will ever, ever be


These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman
Than you will ever, ever 

My year in lists
Stomping on your fingers as you're clinging on to the abyss
So put on every winter coat that you've owned since '98
And every midnight sees the countdown to another awful day
I cherish with fondness the day (before) I met you
I cherish with fondness the day (before) I met you
I cherish with fondness the day before I met you

On your request, I compile a list
Of my top five resolutions for this year (One!)
I declined 'cause I decided that I (Two!)
Do not believe in the New Year anymore (Three!)
And you must confess that at times like these
Hopefulness is tantamount to hopelessness (Four!)
And I accept that it's time for a change
But not in places like this with people like these (Five! Five! Five! Five! Five!)

So baby, all apologies
It was going to happen, inevitably, oh
You might also like
I think we need more post-coital
And less post-rock
Feels like the build-up takes forever
But you never touch my cock
And what exactly do you mean now
By, "What can you even eat?"
And how does that affect
How I'll get off this evening?

I flew down south to Mexico
Had a minor realisation
I understood why kids draw the sun
With its rays emanating
And the beams broke the clouds
The sky looked like a concertina
I'd sat on in my pocket for weeks
Folded up from a picture
I've been playing Straight Chicken with gay girls
It's never enough
She keeps on pulling the peace sign
And it seems like a taunt
She licked a glaze on her lips
They shone like Battleship Grey
She never liked the wisdom I gave
"Some people give themselves to religion
Some people give themselves to a cause
Some people give themselves to a lover
I have to give myself to goals"
So baby, all apologies
It was going to happen, inevitably
And if it helps, I mean, even slightly at all
It's best to dust yourself down and get straight back on the horse

I condescend a smile and wink
Directly at the camera
I leave you led in both our scents
As I tiptoe out the backdoor
I skid down icy streets and view
My face in the reflection
Of a High Street lingerie store
Though it wasn't my intention
I phone my friends and family
To gather 'round the television
The talking heads count down
The most heart-wrenching breakups of all time
Imagine the great sense of waste
The indignity, the embarrassment
When not a single one of that whole century
Was
