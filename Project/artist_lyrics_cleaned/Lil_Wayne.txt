Here Wayne talks about how it felt getting out of jail.
Uh, hundred thousand on a small ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than M's
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin' then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm

Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'ma honk the horn, ridin' past the penitentiary
And I'ma drive slow, ridin' past the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"

Uh, one time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out the pen
My nigga, I'm, I'm post-bail ballin, post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin'

Go tell the warden I'm
Post-bail ballin'

Post-bail ballin'

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standin' in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleepin' on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold, I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep openin' your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight, so I ain't screwin' with it

And I fuck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need trainin' wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, all, nothing else

Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the F is for "Fuck yourself"

And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers

But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And dawg, I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
