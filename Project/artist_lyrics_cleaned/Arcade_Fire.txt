If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
Because it's better than being alone

If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying, "Please come out with us tonight"
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids at art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "Can we still be friends?"

Not sure you'll open the door

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
And every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake

Stop pretending, you've got everything now!

Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now

'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake

Stop pretending, you've got everything now!

The ashes of everything now

Can't make it back again

Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl

Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights!

We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
You shield my eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black River, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, "We don't need your kind"

Some people say
We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost

Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life
Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild
Though we knew this day would come
Still, it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes

Children, wake up
Hold your mistake up
Before they turn the summer into dust
If the children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
We're just a million little gods causing rain storms
Turning every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust

With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand

With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going

I can see where I am go-going
