Where could you be? I'm so alone
Won't you please come home

Sun's comin' up and I'm rollin' over
But I'm holdin' on

(Waiting all night) And I said I'm sorry
(Waiting all night) But you went so far away
(Waiting all night) Don't know why you
(Waiting all night) Left me this way
(Waiting all night) Just sail on, sail on
(Waiting all night) And I said I'm sorry
(Waiting all night) But you went so far away
(Waiting all night) Don't know why you

(Waiting all night) Left me this way

I'd like to live beneath the dirt
A tiny space to move and breathe is all that I would ever need
I wanna live beneath the dirt
Where I'd be free from push and shove, like all those swarming up above
Beneath their heels I'll spend my time

(Shout your name into the wind)
I'll wriggle in the earth and dew
(Shout your name into the wind)
And sometimes I will think of you
(Shout your name into the wind)
And if you ever think of me
Kneel down and kiss the earth
And show me what this thought is worth
(I'll never hear your voice again)


Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)
Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)
Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)
Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)
Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)
Shout your name into the wind (Sha, sha, sha)

Vanessa calls me on the phone
Remindin' me I'm not alone
I fuss and quake and cavitate
I try to speak and turn to stone
Tilly reaches through my vest
To do the thing that she does best
She probes and tears my ventricles
And steals my one remaining breath

Things are fallin' down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried to step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

Stumbling as I fall from grace
She needs my vision to replace
Her ailing sight throughout the night
Leaving two holes in my face
Mary was a friend, I'd say
'Til one summer day
She borrowed everything I own
And then simply ran away

Things are fallin' down on me
Heavy things I could not see
When I finally came around
Something small would pin me down
When I tried to step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be
