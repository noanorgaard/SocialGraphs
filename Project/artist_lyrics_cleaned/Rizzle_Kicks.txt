Can't stop
Break sweat
No losing

Yo, you might hear me make a racket like Wilson
Cause I love summer, no Rachel Bilson (Yes)
The winter will come
We just have parties inside, they're still fun
(We're jamming) Pump this (We're banging)
Chase your boyfriend, let's have him
We're rowdy, girls make our judgement cloudy
But when the sun comes out we're still alcys
We don't wanna be lousy, or shameless
But we're running 'round like we're brainless
Now I've got grass stains on my brand-new white trainers
(On my brand-new white trainers)

And when I enter the room it shows
I move sick (When I dance)
Then chicks (Wanna dance)
Move in and move quick (When I dance)
At risk (When I dance)
Just be careful you don't lose your chick (When I dance)
That might just happen

If I wasn't older, you wouldn't wanna dance with me, yeah
Yeah, you're the last of my fears
I was top boy of the class in my year
Well, not really, but I was halfway there
And I could'a been the headmaster, so yeah
Got vibes and charisma (lighter and rizla)
Baccy and filter (Shine for me mister)
I want the sun to (shine)
Till I'm looking at a bright blue (sky)
