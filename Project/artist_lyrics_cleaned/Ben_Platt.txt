He thought I was awesome? My brother?

Definitely!

How?

Well
(sung)
He said
There's nothing like your smile
Sort of subtle and perfect and real
He said
You never knew how wonderful
That smile could make someone feel
And he knew
Whenever you get bored
You scribble stars on the cuffs of your jeans
And he noticed
That you still fill out the quizzes
That they put in those teen magazines

What he saw he left unsaid
And though he wanted to
He couldn't talk to you
He couldn't find the way
But he would always say
If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me
But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could tell her

Did he say anything else?

A—about you?

Never mind, I don't really care anyways—

No, no, no—just, no, no—he said—he said so many things, I'm just—I'm trying to remember the best ones. So, um—
(sung)
He thought
You looked really pretty, er—
It looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair

He did?

And he wondered how you learned to dance
Like all the rest of the world isn't there
But he kept it all inside his head
What he saw he left unsaid
If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me

But we're a million worlds apart

And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could tell her
But what do you do when there's this great divide?
He just seemed so far away
And what do you do when the distance is too wide?

It's like I don't know anything

And how do you say
“I love you”?
I love you
I love you
I love you
But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start

My speech?

People started sharing it, I guess, and now, I mean—Connor is everywhere.​

Your speech is everywhere. This morning The Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it.​

Well, how many does it have now?

Four ​thousand, five hundred, eighty-two

Sixteen thousand, two hundred and thirty-nine

I don't understand, what happened?

You did
There’s a place where we don’t have to feel unknown

Oh my God
Everybody needs to see this​

And ev'ry time that you call out you’re a little less alone

I can't stop watching this video
Seventeen years old

If you only say the word

Take five minutes, this will make your day

From across the silence your voice is heard

(Oh)
Share it with the people you love

The world needs to hear this
A beautiful tribute— Favorite
(Oh)
I know someone who really needed to hear this today
So thank you Evan Hansen, for doing what you're doing
(Oh, oh)
I never met you Connor, but coming on here, reading everyone's posts...
(Someone will come runnin')
It's so easy to feel alone
(Oh, oh)
But Evan is exactly right—we're not alone, none of us
We're not alone, none of us
None of us
None of us are alone
Like. Forward
Especially now
(Oh, oh)
With everything that you hear in the news—
(Someone will come runnin')
Like. Share. Repost. Forward
Thank you Evan Hansen
For giving us a space to remember Connor
(Oh, oh)
(Someone will come runnin')
To be together
To find each other
Sending prayers from Michigan
(To take you home, to take you home)
Vermont. Tampa. Sacramento
Thank you, Evan Hansen
(To take you home, to take you home)

Even when the dark comes crashin' through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you’re broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streamin' in
'Cause you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found

Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
And all is new
All is new

It's fillin' up the empty
And suddenly I see
That all is new
All is new

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not

You are not alone

You are not alone

Even when the dark comes crashin' through
When you need someone to carry you
When you’re broken on the ground

You will be found

So let the sun come streamin' in

'Cause you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again

If you only look around

You will be found

Even when the dark comes crashin' through

You will be found

When you need someone to carry you

You will be found
You will be found

You will be
