I'd already had a sip
So I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

And with one kiss

You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
(For twenty years)
What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man loves like this?

What kind of man?

But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy in your arms

And is it worth the wait?
All this killing time?
Are you strong enough to stand
Protecting both your heart and mine?
Who is the betrayer?
Who's the killer in the crowd?
The one who creeps in corridors
And doesn't make a sound

Heavy, heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy
Heavy, so heavy in your arms

This will be my last confession
"I love you" never felt like any blessing
Oh
Whispering like it's a secret
Uttered to condemn the one who hears it
With a heavy heart
Whoa

(Heavy) I'm so heavy in your arms
I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown
I was a heavy heart to carry
But he never let me down
When he held me in his arms
My feet never touched the ground

I'm so heavy
Heavy in your arms
Heavy
I'm so heavy in your 

So, darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

She can't see the landscape anymore
It's all painted in her grief
All of her history etched out at her feet
Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
Acres of longing, mountains of tenderness

'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

She wants the silence, but fears the solitude
She wants to be alone and together with you
So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
She saw that the lighthouse had been washed out to sea

I want to give you back the open sky
Give you back the open sea
Open up the ages, darling, for you to see

You put the gun into your mouth to bite
The bullet and spit it out
Because it's running in the family
All the rituals between you and me

'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and 

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah

And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)
(Oh-woah)
(Oh-woah)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause lookin' for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
But what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
