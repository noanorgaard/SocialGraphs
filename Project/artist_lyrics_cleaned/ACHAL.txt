Say a prayer
Oh God, got fuego, fuego
On call, we driving West
On da'vard, after party you know drugs and stuff
I'm triple faded, aw man
She getting too lit, Liu Kang
My mother told me, don't change
I throw the dice baby, now who's playing

Spilling champagne on my jeans
Swiping cards with no receipts
Met some girl I saw on TV
Hit that, drank myself to sleep
I should probably slow it down
But every night I'm going out
And I don't wanna feel alone
Cause I'm here and too far from home

Been holding this cup for too long
I mixed it with the other, it's too strong
Baby for that one right, I'm too wrong
You know you been on it for too long, too long
I started tripping in my room, that's a vacation
I know the difference when I do that combination
It ain't the money, ain't the problems, ain't sensation
I know the difference between love, infatuation

Spilling champagne on my jeans
Swiping cards with no receipts
Met some girl I saw on TV
Hit that, drank myself to sleep
I should probably slow it down
But every night I'm going out
And I don't wanna feel alone
Cause I'm here and too far from home

I left home alone
Don't know which way I'll go
Don't know how long stay
But I'm always on my way
I left home alone
Don't know which way I'll go
Don't know how long stay
But I'm always on my way
And that may never 

You're always gettin' what you want
Ain't nothin' that they need to know
It's more fun when we know it's wrong
It's more fun when we're all alone

I'm just tryna vibe with you, vibe with you
All that other shit can take time
I'm just tryna vibe with you, vibe with you
You know it's better that you ain't mine
I'm just tryna vibe with you, vibe with you
All that other shit can take time
I'm just tryna vibe with you, vibe with you
I'm just tryna vibe with you, vibe with you

You pulled up to Cahuenga and Franklin
We hopped in the backseat
We rolled up, we caught up
Then we did the same thing we did last week (I like that)
Goin' out of my way, I don't want what I'm used to
Long as you feel the same then we don't have an issue
