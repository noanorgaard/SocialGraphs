This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

Different colors
We carry each other
Just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right

We keep cranking the music up
Driving through our towns
But they don't wanna hear
They want us to turn it down
So come on lovers, come on haters
Tonight we raise the fire
Cause when the people get to dancing
They forget about taking sides

You got a look in your eyes (your eyes)
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops

Last call and everybody's watching
Her voice rings out like a storm
Sometimes the past echoes in the future
Started long before we were born
Sometimes you only get one chance

Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness

Cross my heart

I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other

If you don't have trust

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, hoo, shut up and dance with me"

We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened

The real-life love
Is under the mirror of the surface
So cut my cord
I wanna know how deep we can take it
See the thing you've been chasin', honey
You'll never find it wearing a life-vest
You gotta risk your neck
But know in your heart it will be worth it

So here we go
Head first, and no regrets
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

It's been my fashion to keep my head dry and get my feet wet
But step by step, I've been letting you lead me towards the deep end
Well I learned my lesson, honey
Just when you think you're all adult swim
That's precisely when somebody shows you to the ocean

So here we go
Head first, and no regrets
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
Head first, into the water
And so it hits me—I guess we could breathe all along
One breath after another
All I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling around the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
Now it's all a wash

Live my life without

Now it's all a wash

Racing down the hill

I am faster than you
