I'll take you home if you don't leave me at the front door
Your body's cold, but girl, we're getting so warm
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside

Tonight, you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
You might also like
Your lips tremble, but your eyes are in a straight stare
We're on the bed, but your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide

Tonight you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
And I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time
But I was thinking of ways to get you staying the night
Your body's shaking, tell me off so I can turn off the lights
Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake
