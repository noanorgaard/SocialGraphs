Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

Ew

In the most Biblical sense (Ew)
I am beyond repentance
Fame, hooker, prostitute, wench
Vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offenced
Or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to

Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time, I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time, I'm not leaving without you
I said: "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me"
There's something, something about this place
Something 'bout New York nights and my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool American guy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong

My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
