And by the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (Imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad, then I do, too
So, I let her be

And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down
Way down

Well, she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

'Til by the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So, I sit down and I cry, too
But don't let her see

And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight
And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best, and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin'
"Ooh, I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best, and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down

(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No more, no more, no more)
Diamonds fallin' down
(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No more, no more, no more)
Diamonds fallin' down, yeah
(I can't take no more)
(Diamonds on the floor)
(No more, no more, no more)
Her diamonds fallin', all her diamonds fallin' down (Oh, oh, oh)
I can't take these diamonds fallin' 

Just let me hold you, while you're fallin' apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down

Fall on me
Tell me everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same

We would stand in the wind
We were free like water
Flowin' down under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold and we're scared, and we've both been shaken
Hey, look at us, man, this doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you, while you're fallin' apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down
