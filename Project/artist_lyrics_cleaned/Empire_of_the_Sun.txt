Rewind, we were DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind, there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

There is a thread that runs along
The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
Weave all into one
The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures, rays and larks
Relax
(Just to take me away)

Take me away
So far away
No-one will find us
On our own island
Just out of choice
The dreamer fought the battleship away
It's over the horizon
Voices inside of us to guide us on
Guiding us on
Can't you hear us calling you
Can't you hear us calling you

Drawing the pictures of our lives
Watch and wonder as they come alive
The characters become my friends
As the empire begins to rise
Something gains its place now
After floods have washed away
Just love someone more than yourself
Give yourself away

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun 'til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believin' now?

Walking on a dream
How can I explain?
Talking to myself
Will I see again?

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on, we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now?
Two people become one
I can feel it
Two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minute's working overtime

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on, we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
