I'm the weatherman
No one else more dedicated

Well, hey kid
You got the right
But the choice to kill
No, Son of Sam
Will let you in to turn against

Go for the kill, go for the kill
Go for the kill, go for the kill
Go for the kill, go for the kill

Come on, baby, show me your favorite
I'm as addicted as the lips to your cigarette
I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me
To adore ya
All right

All in favor, take a stand and defend me
I'm so cold and lonely, I could be dead

My brain is scattered like the thoughts in my patter (Ha!)
'Cause I'm a lover of a second degree (And a killer)
My Mona Lisa wasn't looking at me, c'mon

I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like

Throw some salt over your shoulder, baby!

I know what you want
But it's not gonna be what you like
