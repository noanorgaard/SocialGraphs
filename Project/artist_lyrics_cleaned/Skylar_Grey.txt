Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love

You see the signs, but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine, a one track mind
You can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats, your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah

I will be drunk on cheap beer
Like everyone else around here
You've got the world at your feet
But there's nothing out there for me

You don’t have to lie
Sayin' that you’ll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

You’re high up on the tower
Now don't look down
I will be ok here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer mine

Here in a pale shade of life
Under the trailer park lights
There'll be nothing left for you to see
You won't even recognize me

You don't have to lie
Sayin' that you'll try
To make it work from a distance
Just leave me here to die
As I watch you climb
Up to the top of your ambitions

I always knew (I always knew)
That you would follow your big dreams
What I didn’t know (What I didn’t know)
Is that your dreams (your dreams) never did include me
You're high up on the tower
Now don't look down
I will be ok here on the ground
And you can always call
To say hello from time to time
When you're no longer
