Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin' through the venetian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question: if the Prada dressin' and the Gucci
All got ghost, and a freeze on the lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it 'cause I'm askin' for real
Golddiggers gon' hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine or that other weather, when we chasin' forever, uh

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, let's stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)

Chasin' forever, a buckwild endeavorous scene
Are we pursuin' somethin real or just chasin' a dream
Or casin' the scene, 'fore I die, I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin' for sure
But I'm committed to growin' and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynchpin of love is trust
And taught me monogamy is a monoga-must
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gots to make together, forever

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, let's stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks, I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searching for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushing me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carats than even bugs could eat in a week
And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes, don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids calling you mom and calling me dad
Having more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Each and every day forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever, only you)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together don't you go nowhere)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Stay forever
(Forever, forever)
Each and every day
(Forever chasing forever)
Forever, forever, forever
With only you
(Forever chasing 

(Just the two of us, oh, hey)
(Just the two of us)
(Just the two of us)
(Just the two of us)
(Just the two of us)

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death 'fore I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just to get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night, I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
'Cause I knew I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord, please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Five years old, bringin' comedy
Every time I look at you, I think, "Man, a little me"
Just like me, wait and see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh 'cause you got your dad's ears and all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gon' be?
A general, a doctor, maybe an MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh, why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin' me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor and
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
And you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me and your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So, if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back, uh
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I, yeah

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin' times
101 Dalmatians on your CD-ROM
See, me, I'm tryin' to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust, life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day, some girl's gonna break your heart
And, ooh, ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life, people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

(This is a really good song. How much am I gettin' paid for this, 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, "Hi, Will!"
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, "Will, we loved your last hit!"
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay, papi!"
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home (Miami)
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami

Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it (Ugh, ugh, ugh)

Watch your step (Woo), you might fall trying to do what I did
Mama (Ugh) mama (Ugh) mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty-yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali—he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bump my hits and watch them go off, a-go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all (Woo), ya don't stop

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
