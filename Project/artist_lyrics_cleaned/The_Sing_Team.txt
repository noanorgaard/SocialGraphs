Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
I can remember when You showed Your face to me

As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts for You
And when I behold Your glory, You so faithfully renew
Like a bed of rest, for my fainting flesh
I am satisfied in You

When Iʼm staring at the ground
Itʼs an inbred feedback loop that brings me down
So itʼs time to lift my brow
And remember better days
When I loved to worship You in all Your ways
With the sweetest songs of praise
You might also like
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
I can remember when You showed Your grace to me

As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts for You
And when I survey Your splendor, You so faithfully renew
Like a bed of rest, for my fainting flesh
I am satisfied in You

Let my sighs give way to songs that sing about Your faithfulness
Let my pain reveal Your glory as my only real rest
Let my losses show me all I truly have is You
'Cause all I truly have is You

So when Iʼm drowning out at sea
And Your breakers and Your waves crash down on me
Iʼll recall Your safety scheme
Youʼre the One who made the waves
And Your Son went out to suffer in my place
And to tell me that Iʼm safe

So why am I down?
Why so disturbed?
I am satisfied in You

I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in
