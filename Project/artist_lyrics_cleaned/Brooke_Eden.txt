All the boys are watching us right now
Welcome to the weekend, everybody's drinking
Everybody's here to throw it down
Me and all my ladies getting famous in this town
Shining like diamonds, dancing in the headlights
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, we're shine

We can own the night, we don't need no cash
'Cause we got sparkle, baby we got class
But it ain't about what you got, it's what you live for anyway

Shining like diamonds, dancing in the headlights
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, we're shine
