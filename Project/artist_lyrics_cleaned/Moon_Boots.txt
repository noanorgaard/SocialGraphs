Baby when I see you walk
It charge into my soul
Talented you got it all
And act like you don't know
Even though you try so hard
You never let it show
You wouldn't open up your heart
Except to let me go

'Cause it could'a been you, babe
But you had to hesitate
Could'a been you, babe
But you were too afraid
Could'a been you, babe
But you had to hesitate, had to investigate
You, baby
But you were too afraid, you couldn't keep the faith
You
You might also like
I thought we would hit it off
That I was mister right
But I know when to take a loss
Who am I to fight?
I know that you could heal my pain
You could save my life
You probably don't remember my name
But that's alright

Could'a been you, babe
You had to hesitate
Could'a been you, babe
But you were too afraid
Could'a been you, babe
You had to hesitate, had to investigate
Could'a been you, baby
But you were too afraid, you couldn't keep the faith
(You)
