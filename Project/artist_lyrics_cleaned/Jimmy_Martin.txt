Now don't forget about the days we courted many years ago
Don't forget all the promises you gave me, and so
I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall

Please tell me, darling, in your letter, do you ever think of me?
Please answer, little darling, tell me where you can be
It's been so long since I've seen you, but the love still lingers on
Don't forget me, little darling, though our love affair seems gone

You gettin' all them banjo breaks in your head, ain't ya?
Pardon?
You gettin' all of 'em
Well, I had 'em in my head at one time
But I quit playin' for a whileSee Nitty Gritty Dirt Band LiveGet tickets as low as $79You might also
