Our life support machine
Was brought to life by remarkable hands
Forget about the hell we've seen
The time has come to revive our band
So bang the drums to a rhythm
Captivating the beat
And press the keys on the piano
For the ritual please
The song's alive with the night
With your help we'll revive
The devil's advocate
Is staring right through your lies
You might also like
You're just retuning our old strings tonight
I hope you turn on the light now!
Can I get an amen in here?
You see the magic of art
It would tear you apart if you knew!
Can I get an amen in here?
This magic is fueled by your heart
But the dreams in his eyes were untrue
He had bigger plans for the band
By demand we came back to this darkened cell
You're gonna break us out of this hell!

We've been stars since the rhythm days
But our instruments have all grown tired
And in the end our only dream was to dance
They took the dance away and we got retired
But that was long ago
We have a new change of face
We've turned it up a couple notches
With a brand new pace
You think they all just erased us
Betrayed us, enslaved us
But the deed is done
And now we want to get out!
Now listen up!
Ain't it nice to be underground
With a good ol' friend like me
So you notice that sign, we ain't lying
But sit down and take a seat
There's an exit for sure
But that's for shmucks
But a little bit of ink
And a couple of bucks
We can reopen the curtains
And show off the strut
But for goodness sake
You gotta just believe!

You're just retuning our old strings tonight
I hope you turn on the light now!
Can I get an amen in here?
You see the magic of art
It would tear you apart if you knew!
Can I get an amen in here?
This magic is fueled by your heart
But the dream in his eyes were untrue
He had bigger plans for the band
By demand we came back to this darkened cell
You're gonna break us out!
Go to sleep my little sheep
It's time to rest your head
Whether alive or dead
I am the keeper of the key
That will set us all free
I bring the demon back to life
There's a song I sing that shows us the light
Even in the lighter side of hell
We sing with delight
Play the notes that I require
This will please my desires
You have given me the tools
To restart this fire!

There's a twisted fate
That controls us and betrays us
My friends have a death wish
And all of this is him to blame!
Now we've brought him to his knees
Your only hope to escape this
Is to embrace this
We need your help
To keep this demon at bay!
Let's end this today!

"You're the conductor of this performance now, Henry"
"Will you take their word, or ours?"
"Golly I hope this works!"
"You turned on this machine"
"Now you have to believe"

Can I get an amen in here?
You see the magic of art
It would tear you apart if you knew!
Can I get an amen in here?
This magic is fueled by your heart
But the dreams in his eyes were untrue
He had bigger plans for the band
By demand we came back to this world of grey
Welcome to the gospel of
