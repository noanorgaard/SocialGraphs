Uh huh
PRIME
B-Sides
MDOT
This is Hip Hop
Yo
I got more lyrics than Churches got Ooh Lawds
Who Lord?
Pushing forward in the Honda Accord
Leather Jacket
Smooth Criminal senza packing
Ooze Subliminals
Rents or Packing
Stay stacking
Cash & Yen
Euros & Pounds
Mumbai
Beats by the Ounce
And My Story
They soon Buy
My style got the beat singing Kumbaya
Perfect stance
Hand in hand in foreign lands
You might also likeI keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
My Composition wasn't Competition
Now I'm dropping writtens in booths
And ripping opposition
Odd sufficient
Eyes of Vision
Sunrise Arisen
Y'all faker than rat meat disguised as chickens
That ain't no Diss
If it is
You didn't listen
Everybody claim they cooking from
Imaginary Kitchеns
I keep em both separate
Thе Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
You would swear it was written by
Charles Dickens
B-Sides Yo
Capodanno means a New Year
I'm speaking on a New Day
Capelli's at the Top
Still faker than a Toupee
The game done turned Fiasco
No Lupe
Verbal Chef
Check the metaphors in my Soufflé
When I'm on the Microphone
The Bars are My Forte
Okay Playa
Go to Broadway if you want them Oye's
Sipping on some OJ
Listening to the Ojay's
Watching HBO play
Reruns of the Trial of OJ
Keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
If the Glove don't Fit you can Acquit
Except for when it's with Condoms
It's the opposite
Get It?!
I demand your Respect
Check the size of my Marble Set
Like Jay Elec(tronica)?
You ain't heard the Prime Artist yet
That ain't no Diss
If it is
You didn't listen
Everybody claim they cooking from
Imaginary Kitchens
I keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
You would swear it was written by
Charles Dickens
(B-Sides yo)
Listen
So many late nights that 1:30 is my early
Big nigga might swing Burly
Stay Brolic
Fighting Vampires
PRIME write Garlic
With wooden stakes
And find insight in Knowledge that
You wouldn't take
I couldn't wait
To grab the Microphone
Crush it in my hand
Until it disintegrate to particles of Sand
Prides of Man make them not wanna speak up
That's why the Mainstream push the weak up
They Dumb It Down
Yo
I keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
You would swear it was written by Charles Dickens
Keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
You would swear it was written by Charles Dickens
That ain't no Diss
If it is
You didn't listen
Everybody claim they cooking from
Imaginary Kitchens
I keep em both separate
The Hole and the Pidgeon
And my Vision?
You would swear it was written by
Charles Dickens
Prime Artist
The New Poet
I'm too
