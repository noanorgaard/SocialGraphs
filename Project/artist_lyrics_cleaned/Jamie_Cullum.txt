My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

And oh, what a difference a day made
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you, find romance, on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you
Is you

My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

Do you know what you started
I just came here to party
Now we're rocking on the dancefloor
Acting naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest
Now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Lets escape into the music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
...for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ryone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singing
Singing in the rain
...in the rain

I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singing
Singing in the rain

In the rain
