I killed the pussy, it's dead
She a brat, she want my bread
I hold them racks to my head, I swear that I couldn't even hear what you said
Skate on this ice like a sled
No, I don't even fuck with no feds (Fuck 12)
Go in the house, don't be scared
She geeking and don't need no man
Up in the earth, can't feel my body
Came out the dirt, don't need nobody
Pull and skrt, she said she got shotty
Shawty gon' ride it, lil' momma got body
I got that clip, momma sound like a Tommy
Nigga you pussy, go cry to your mommy
Niggas be looking, I don't see nobody

I feel like John Cena, niggas not me or us
Baby gon' clean me up, I'm tryna see what's up
Anyways, what's that plus
Anyways, what's that plus
It ain't evеn no game, in the crib broke as fuck
I don't wanna bеat time, feeling alright
I'm going up, got smoke in my lungs
I done got hot, give a fuck 'bout nun
Bae, I'll be back by the end of the month
I done got set, now I'm on my run
I got the Chromes, put it on my son
Don't care what you need, I don't give no fucks
Add it up, add it up, I'mma get sum
Aye, brand new watch, brand new chain
I don't want, niggas getting lame
All for the money, all for the fame
What should I do? Call La Flame
Told me, "Keep going, go stay in your lane"
Yeah, it get rough 'fore a dime feel pain
Buddy couldn't see with a scope, no shade
