Don't tell me you can't see
What it means to me
Me, me

Meanwhile in the moonlight
Purple people, unforeseeable
Lonely as they may be
They'll be peachy, then it hits me

Don't tell me you can't see
What it means to me
Me, me, me

Sunshine on the window
Makes me happy like I should be
Outside, all around me
Really sleazy, then it hits me
You might also like
Don't tell me you can't see
What it means to me
Me, me, don't tell me you can't see
What it means to me
Me, me,
