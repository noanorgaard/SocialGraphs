Stay alive
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces"
I shoot back, "We have resorted to eating our horses"
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

The cavalry's not coming

But, sir

Alex, listen
There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

That's right
You might also like
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless 'til their troops take flight

Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight
Uh-huh
Outrun

Outrun

Outlast

Outlast

Hit 'em quick, get out fast

Chick-a-plao
Stay alive until this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast
Raise a glass

I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie and bravery

We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And every day, "Sir, entrust me with a command"
And every day

No
He dismisses me out of hand

Stay alive

Instead of me, he promotes Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command

I'm a General, whee

Yeah
He's not the choice I woulda gone with

He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

Everyone attack

Retreat

Attack

Retreat

What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

But there's so many of them

I'm sorry, is this not your speed?
Hamilton!

Ready, sir

Have Lafayette take the lead

Yes, sir

A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

Charles Lee was left behind without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

Ooh

Don't do a thing, history will prove him wrong

But, sir!
We have a war to fight, let's move along

Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

I can't disobey direct orders
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

Laurens, do not throw away your

Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there

Highlights!

Is a connection with one

For purposes of
Improper speculation
My real crime is an (My real crime is an)
Amorous connection with his wife (Amorous connection with his wife)
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent

And I tried

Eliza
I put myself back in the narrative

Eliza

I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It’s not enough

Eliza

I interview every soldier who fought by your side

She tells our story

I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you’re running out of—
Time
I rely on—

Angelica
While she’s alive—
We tell your story

She is buried in Trinity Church

Near you

When I needed her most, she was right on—

Time

And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more—”

Time

The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—

Time

I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument
She tells my story

I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—

Time

And when my time is up, have I done enough?

Will they tell our story?

Will they tell your story?

Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?

The orphanage

I established the first private orphanage in New York City

The orphanage

I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

The orphanage

In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—

Time

And when my time is up
Have I done enough?
Will they tell my story?

Will they tell your story?

Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—

Will they tell your story?
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
Will they tell your story?

Monsieur Lafayette

In command where you belong

How you say, no sweat (Hey)
We're finally on the field, we've had quite a run
Immigrants:

We get the job done

So what happens if we win?
You might also like
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people, if I'm given the chance

We'll be with you when you do

Go, lead your men

I'll see you on the other side

'Til we meet again, let's go!

I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
'Til the world turns upside down
'Til the world turns upside down!

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me
On my feet, the enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

What?

The bullets out your gun!

What?

We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of the bayonet
The code word is "Rochambeau," dig me?
Rochambeau!

You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining bravery

We'll never be free until we end slavery!

When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there, waiting

In Chesapeake Bay!

How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside, that's right

Hercules Mulligan!

A tailor spyin' on the British government
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

Up

To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody's gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down, I get the fuck back up again! (Let's go!)
Hahaha, woo!
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

Not yet

We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing

The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down, down
Down, down, down

Freedom for America, freedom for France!

Down, down, down

Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son

Down, down, down

We won!

We won!

We won!

We won!

The world turned upside
