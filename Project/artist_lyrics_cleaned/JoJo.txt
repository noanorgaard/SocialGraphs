Saw it in your eyes when you said goodbye
You didn't even try, so this time, I don't care

And honestly, I was just about to pick up the phone
And then I realized that I didn't do nothing wrong
You would even tell two lies to prove that you were right
Usually I'd go on and take the blame but not this time, not this time

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

Okay, uh, no apologizing
Ain't no way to take the things you did back or disguise it
Always wonder what I'm doing, but that's TMI
Don't know what you got until it's gone, now you realize it
When I wasn't playing smart now I'm being wise
Finally I'm moving on and I don't need your lies
And it wasn't even tough 'cause I can see the signs
Now you're stuck, call an Uber up if you need a ride

Didn't do nothing wrong, ayy

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

If I, if I, if I really
If I, if I, but I don't really
You know I, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
If I, if I, if I really
If I, if I, but I don't really
You know I, I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

What you want from me?
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
(I don't mean it baby)
Fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
(I know)
I'm not perfect, I got pride
That's not what it is this time
So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it
What you want from me?
Fuck apologies

So fuck apologies
I would say I'm sorry if I really meant it

It's like we speak a different language
These double-sided conversations set me up
Keep dodging bullets in the bedroom
But neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're ending
Until we break down, say it now, we're through
All you do

When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah, that's how you know it
Yeah, that's how you know
When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real

Those signs went through me like a freight train
You're  getting off testing my patience 'til it's gone
But then again, I do the same thing
And neither one will ever say we've had enough

Help, I can't tell if we're bending
Until we break down, say it now, we're through
All you do (Oh, all you do)

When love hurts, baby
Yeah, that's how you know it's real
When love hurts, yeah, that's how you know it

Oh, and I know it's 

One by one we'll be switching it up
Like it's Everlast
Go in, round two when the skies turning blue
When we finally crash

No, I don't care where we stand, man
Hundred and one night stands
Or, full time lovers
Ay, listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
If you wanna come eat edibles
Do some freaky shit, incredible
I'm your girl, I'm your girl
But listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"

Damn, you got my foot prints on the ceiling
On the mirror, on the headboard, in the bathroom
On the marble floor
Does somebody's cookie got you leaning?
Got you fiending?

Green candies melting us together
I feel higher up than Fenway Park
Is it your fingers giving tingles or this
Hydroponic daily spark?
Meet me in the dark
I need you here 10 PM sharp
Oh, yeah, yeah

No, I don't care where we stand, man

(Oooh, doo doo doo doo)
(Now that you know)
Now that you know, 

'Cause where I wanna be is far apart
From where we are
From where we are
And I thought I found the place where we could start
Talk from the heart
Talk from the heart

But you just say I'm perfect
Say I'm pretty
Say I'm worth it
But if you really care for me

Say "love"
I want you to say "love"
I want you to say "love"
When I say "love you"
You just say "me too"
But I want you to say "love"
