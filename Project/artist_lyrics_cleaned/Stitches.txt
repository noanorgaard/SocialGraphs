I flip bricks so I'm ballin', I hit licks as a hobby
I wish a motherfucker would say that Stitches isn't ballin'
Bricks up in my trunk, bricks up in my attic
When it comes to doin' drugs they say that I'm a drug addict
Rob him for a brick, rob him!
I just might snort the whole damn brick!
My life is lovely, it's like I'm made of gold
These hoes always wanna touch me
Hold my cocaine for me and that's if you really love me
Diamonds on my pinky ring, diamonds on my Rolie watch
(She's suckin' my cock!)
I'm sellin' drugs and I cannot stop
And all of my bullets for the cops

Tie you to a chair, nigga, call your plug
Ain't a day in my life, I ain't on them drugs
Stay fuckin' all these bitches, never fall in love
Brick Bible, this a statement, nigga, fuck your rifle
I made my own Brick Bible, nigga, fuck the rappin'
I'm gettin' baptised in the 
Pussy, money, weed, that's all a nigga needs
Now we're lookin' for them niggas, where they at?
It sounds like a thousand haters when that chopper clap
Lord have mercy on me, this life with sins is lonely
You can't walk in my shoes, you end up  on the glory
Wake up in the mornin', crack another brick
Buy another phone, them cops is on my shit
In the kitchen Imma stove
Twist them with the flip
If this rap shit don't work, bitch, I'm still sellin' bricks

Rip this ho, she broken ('Cause she broken)

I ain't doin' no back and forth with these niggas, 'cause they broke, yeah
This Bentley Mussane, hop in that G when I go off road (When I go off road)
This bitch so bad, when I hop inside I use no Trojan
Hop outside, Nascar, bitch I'm speedin'
Skrrtin' off so fast today, my heart rate done lost control of me
When I walk inside, that's on my gang, you know we ballin'
Fuckin' with two twins, yeah, yeah

Stay with this rod, nigga, I ain't talkin' no Philly GOAT

Countin' up green like the front yard, nigga
Pop a sedative, bitch, this ain't no Flintstone
Stay with that Drac', like I'm Lil Yachty

B-bitch, I knew this from the get go
I don't want that ho, just want her body
Pour the drank, and let it sit, ho

The last nigga moved wrong, and he got sent home
That bitch, she a ho, she so ungodly
She suck my dick up, touch her neck bone
Lot of influence like I'm young Gandhi
Outside, smokin' in door
Light a nigga up, bingo
All white Forces on me, bitch, it's green go
Love my voice, she love my lingo

I remember that time on URL that I never spent
I got paid to do a battle that never happened
And I kept every cent
You smell me? Tell b I kept scorchin’ to that Whoville
Horton, a God to that URL event
Who say they the world and all I keep hearin' is
These little voices tellin' me you can’t copy respect, it’s trust
Same people who feel like they world is everything
But all I see is a speck of dust
Irrelevant niggas want a piece of me, I tell ‘em it’s no slice
They hunger, isn’t never to slumber
I do my numbers on a square, the element’s so dice
But I gives no fucks: I’m celibate
And I’m buggin' off the top, where I’m headed is fro lice
The flow elegant, straight kitchen, when Day spittin'
Consider it great stitchin', I tell 'em I’m so nice
But I’m 'bout to go in, bree, yo, another lil fella with no life
You better abort, shun, ‘fore you see what the lead did
Quill, I stillbirth the new style
So the feat is guaranteed, you’ll be dead, kid
It was over before you came out, lil fella: miscarriage
That’s a toddler, tragedy, Dizaster said I’m a bastard
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck about son
And I’m your father, apparently
But what I inherited is a slug, man, and a gun to pound with
What you gon inherit is Harriet Tubman
You goin' underground, bitch!
And that’s for railroads, I had to give him the clip
What I gotta put that it in “Grindin” or somethin'?
I said that Pharell road, I had to give him the Clipse
They said my antics killin' this shit
Well, check my momentum, I need all viewers
I took the West from inches to a foot every yard: we all rulers
That last battle I had with ICE, chess: we are cooler
Y’all bout to see b rest while I’m eatin': we are Hooters
I been searchin' for this little boy all night: we are cougars
You sleep on me, you get killed in your dream: we are Kruger
Fine, get smoked with the lines: we are hookahs
Clips is a clear joke: these are bloopers
I go fire on that last level: we are Koopa
Everybody in that van draws: we are Luther
Standin' there with the gauge soon as you arrive: we are Loopers
That power range rip off shit: V.R. Troopers
First of all, don’t hype his pride
To kill you I was searchin' for the right disguise
So fuck this mask, I want you to look your killer in the eyes
SIKE! I LIED!
I told you, nigga, this is Day's city
I don’t know what the fuck y’all thought in they city
Dog get aired with a round to the mouth: play frisbee
He said I’m on my bipolar shit, I tell him I’m on my straight grizzly
This is a tragic spoof
When I shoot dog, I’ll mute dog, you won’t have a 

Your boyfriend's a joke, your boyfriend is broke
Come fuck with Stitches, I got kilos on my boat
She sayin', "Stitches, I love you"
I think my diamonds make her crazy
First day she met me, say she wanna have my baby
I'm smokin' weed, I'm sippin' lean
Pull up in a Maserati up to the scene
TMZ takin' pictures, while I'm rollin' these swishers
Gettin' head while I'm drivin', and best belive I still kiss her
She say, "Stiches you too freaky for me"
To tell you the truth, I'm startin' to think that bitch is an informant
She's askin' way too many questions
Imma Chris Brown that ho, teach her a lesson
Slap that bitch two times and tell that bitch to get to steppin'
Imma always be rich, they call me, "Mister Steal Yo Bitch"
Now that boy say he got a problem
I got a AK-47, Imma solve it

So I had to be the bigger man and put racks in his head
Me and you, boy, we can't relate, we got a different story
I done living in a fishing scene but now my crib too story
And I hate these fake rappers tryna claim that they real
Just because you rap about dope that shit don't mean that you real
But you know I'm puttin' dope up in your baby's diaper
And what you know 'bout fuckin' a bitch but really you don't like her
I use that bitch as my mule, she drives my bricks from Mexico

Had a dream that all my niggas stuntin' and they was livin' lavish

This is a  the picture of a chico chasin' riches
I kept it one-hundred, I ain't never brake no bridges
See, my daddy was a dope boy, and my uncle was a jack boy
One thing about my fam', we ain't never bein' broke, boy
And it started with a pop, and it ended with a song
Middle finger to the judge that ain't never gave 'em bail
Man, I do it for the real, the rough, and the rugged
Throw me in the pot, I bet that come back one-hundred
And I'm , that's a letter to the feds
And all the pussy niggas got a price up on my head
