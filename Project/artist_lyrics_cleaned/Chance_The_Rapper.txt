I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up (Good God)
The blessings come down, Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
(Good God)

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

We don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Tastes like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
