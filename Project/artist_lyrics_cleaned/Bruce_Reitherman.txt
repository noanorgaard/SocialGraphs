Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

You eat ants?
Hahaha, you gotta believe it
And you're gonna love the way they tickle
Mowgli, look out!
You might also like
The bare necessities of life will come to you (When?)
They'll come to you

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear (Ow!)
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue?
(Golly, thanks Baloo!)

Paw-paw, ha! Of all the silly gibberish
C'mon Baggy, get with the beat!
The bare necessities of life will come to you
(They'll come to me!)
They'll come to you

How about scratchin' that ol' left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
Now just a hair lower.. There, right there. That's it. Ahh..
This is beautiful. That's good. Kid, we've got to get to a tree
This calls for some big scratch!
You're lots of fun, Baloo!
Right on it.. Yeah! That's delicious! Oh, ooo! Just a little bit--
Mmm.. yeah.. ha-ha.. ooo
Mm... mmm... ha-ha.. ooo. yeah!
Oh man, this is really livin'

So just try and relax, yeah, cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something, little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh-uh
You're working too hard
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true
The bare necessities of life will come to you
Ahh.. I give up. Well I hope his luck holds out
Mowgli, how 'bout you singing?

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
(Yeah, man!)
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life
(Yeah!)
With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah,
