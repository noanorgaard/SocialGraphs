And yet, and yet, I'm back

This town has a strange magnetic pull
Like a homing signal in your skull
And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere
Wondering how in the Hell did ye end up here?
It's like an underground river, or a hidden stream
That flows through your head, and haunts your dreams
And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack
And there's nothing round here that the wide world lacks

And yet, and yet, you're back

Some nights I'd lie on the deck and I'd stare at the turning of the stars
Those constellations hanging up there from the cables and the rigging
I'd wonder if she saw the same, or managed to recall my name
But why would she ever think of me? Some boy she loved who fled to sea?
And why waste time debating whether she'd be waiting for the likes of me?

And perhaps a door's slammed in my face
My head must be in outer space

And yet, and yet
Before the sun has set
Before the sea
There may be something else that's waiting for
The likes of me

So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms, she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
