I see you arriving in your car, hey
Jet black Mercedes, built in the 70s
Classic like you and me
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But boy, when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
You might also like
Honestly, I shouldn't waste time no more, yeah, yeah
'Cause all these little boys you're chasing
Did they break your heart?
I know you've been down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I won't let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But girl, when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la (Yeah)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

If you feel the same
I see it in the way that you behave around me
And I can tell
What we have is different from anyone else
'Cause you stop doing what you're doing
When I call, you come to me running
And I would do the same for you
So tell me that you feel it too
I feel a little rush (I fell a little rush)
I think I've got a little crush on you (A little crush on you)
I hope it's not too much
But boy, when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la (Ooh, yeah, baby)
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby
And I feel it too
I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby
Oh,
