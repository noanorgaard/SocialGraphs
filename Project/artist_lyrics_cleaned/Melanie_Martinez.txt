Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen

Places, places, get in your places
"Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces"
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
"Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?"
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees

Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh oh, she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic

Think I just remembered somethin'
I think I left the faucet runnin'
Now my words are fillin' up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers prunin' up

I'm tired of being careful, tiptoe
Trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh-oh, there it goes
I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God, I wish I never spoke

Think I got myself in trouble
So I'll fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Man, I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

I'll cry until the candles burn down this place

Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
Or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons

I'm peeling the skin off my face
'Cause I really hate being safe
The normals, they make me afraid
The crazies, they make me feel sane

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are

I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do

Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you

Lettin' go, lettin' go
Tellin' you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Askin' you where you want us to go
You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this comin' off in a cheesy way?
