Now it's like the world owes you
Walkin' around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you

And I had no idea what that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed by the people around you
I used to take the long way just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside, but I guess I won't anymore

There's so much I wanna tell you
So long, I wanna be thereSee Tame Impala LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also 

I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?

Stop before it's too late

Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess

Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…

I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change, but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl, it's calling

I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Destined to be, lonely old me

Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong
How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do
Is ask me why

'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control

Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no

All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry
