Right now
You got me feeling like I can’t believe I let you go
I’ve been alone so long
And now I wonder what the hell we were thinking of
Oh I can’t believe I kid myself again, again
Now I’m letting go
And all my fear, all my fear
I’ve been fearing this too long

Back beat, counting time
Pick it up and tell me if you really wanna dance some more
We’re borderline wasting time
Pick it up and tell me that you love me like you did before
I understand, understand
I been feeling it so long
I’m flying when I’m in your arms
I’m burning up, burning up
Feeling like I kid myself, kid myself again
Yeah

Think fast
Don’t let the speed of sound leave you feeling paralyzed
Slow down
'Cause your words are saying something different than your eyes
Oh, If only we could make it so we didn’t have to try so hard
To stay in time again
Oh, show me how, show me how
And you will leave me wanting more
