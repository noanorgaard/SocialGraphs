I see a lot of hate
I hear a lot of fakin', yeah
But I ain't got no shame
So they ain't gonna say shit
See, we're all the same
Just don't know how to say it
We can have it our way
We can make it amazin', yeah

Don't let em' under your skin
Don't need to take it all in
Yeah, just erase it
Get back to basics
No, we've got nothin' to stress
You know it's all green ahead
So play it, play it again, so play it again

Rewind, take it from the first line
We could write it all night
Stay in past the sun
Play it while we're young
With a song in our head always on
Yeah, this is real life
Play it while we're young
You might also like
I can hear your heart jump, take it from the lost one
Close eyes, nose dive, take me to the water
Treat a couple people, think I'm eating off of concerts
And pizza still devoured more than towers off of cough syrup
Mmh, I went broke and I ain't change on them still
Just fixed the labels till we breaking them deals, they gotta face it
Now I'm buzzing in my country, Harriet Tubman in my twenties
I been housing ever since I seen my name on them bills
They tell ya, "Woo child, I'm amazing"
Look how I turned them hurricanes into a rain dance
Now them refugees is jealous, a bunch of gossip because of me
But you gon' have to tell me when my plane land
I mean, of course it's me, many endorsing me
I penciled in them gentlemen who opened doors for me
So Mr. Mikey, press record and sing them chords for me
Like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Rewind, take it from the first line
We could write it all night
Stay in past the sun
Play it while we're young
With a song in our head always on
Yeah, this is real life
Play it while we're young, play it while we're-
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, play it while we're young
While we're young, oh play it
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da

Play it while we're young, play it while we're young
With a song in our head always on
Yeah, this is real life
Play it while we're young, play it while we're
Rewind, take it from the first line
We could write it all night
Stay in past the sun
Play it while we're young
With a song in our head always on
Yeah, this is real life
Play it while we're young, play it while we're

Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, play it while we're young
While we're young, oh play it
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
