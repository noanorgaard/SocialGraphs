We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold

Can you steady all the hands that you hold
If you never look away from the drop?
If you push yourself, then I will pull you on
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
You might also like
I will wait to see if you come at all
To stop us falling out of phase
Let's see if we can keep track of losing days
You smile so wide, I can see the sides
To stop us falling out of phase
I will be with you in the fray
With those second thoughts you asked for
All you asked for

We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold

And make them 

Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
You'll meet me, you'll meet me
You'll meet me halfway
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me there
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway

Tied to the shifting ground
Like I always was
Like I always was
You were the perfect storm
But it's not enough
It's not enough, not enough, not enough
You might also like
Just another time that I go down, but you are keeping up
Holding to a hope you'll undermine, never to be reversed
Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me, tell me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Tell me, tell me you'll keep me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Will you meet me more than halfway up?

Shaped by clearest blue
Shaped by clearest blue
Shaped (Will you keep it half-a-way?) by clearest blue

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways

Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me

And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told

I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause (Oh-oh-oh)
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man (Man, man, man...)

I will show restraint
Just like we said we should
You think I'll apologise for things I left behind
But you got it wrong
And I'm as sane as I ever was
You talk far too much
For someone so unkind
I will wipe the salt off of my skin
And I'll admit that I got it wrong
And there is grey between the lines

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

In the dying light, I'm the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

Into the night, for once, we're the only ones left
I bet you even know where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It's a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
