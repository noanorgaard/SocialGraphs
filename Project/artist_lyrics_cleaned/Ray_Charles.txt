You give your hand to me and then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell, you think you know me well
Well, you don't know me (No, you don't know me)
No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Oh, I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me (No, you don't know me)

Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too (Love me too)

You give your hand to me and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, to never, never know the one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, you never, never know the one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

You don't love me
You don't know
