Looking down at my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off, I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother know it, I wonder if she ever regrets
Tryna convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
'Cause people hated on me, how could I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing, "Ayo, I'm with my child"
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said, "All I ever wanted was you to stay a while", damn

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

And, hey, hey, hey
It's been so long since you've gone away

Five years to be more specific
I was out trying to sign to Atlantic, you crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buying
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high in it
And while I'm writing my first verse, he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know, so I hang up without saying nothing, just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it, so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smiled
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories
And you'll be next to me, and both of us can stay a while, yeah
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

And, hey, hey, hey

One day I'll be gone
One day, one day, one day, one day I'll be gone

(But are you missing me?)
One day, one day, one day, one day I'll be gone

One day, one 

Uh, waiter bring another round, please
Bring that motherfucker back, uh
A couple more, they like, "get out, please
'Cause y'all don't know how to act"
And I don't give a fuck, can I live?
'Cause we be doin' too much shit
Just a couple of kids from Eastside of the 216
Bummin' a dollar and a dream, real shit
Every day I wake up, higher than the night before
Blackin' out every night on tour
5 a.m. we jumpin' in the pool in our drawers 'til the cops come
Run, run, fuck the law, and I was born to be wild
Sex, rock and roll, and weed piles
Runnin' from the old and senile
Followin' my steps, then you walking the green mile
'Cause trees in my pockets like my denim's a greenhouse
Lead my team's town, tell me what's my age again
How many hours 'til I rage again?
This is the story of a young boy in the page we in
Say that he off chasin' fame again
And there he goes
Almost famous, bitch, bitch, bitch, yeah, Kells

Fuck clothes and fuck hoes
Hundred dollars worth of munchies, truckloads
Eighty-nine cents slushy in the cup hold
Don't know where I'm goin', but we gone, what's home?
Maybe I'll just MapQuest my dream, and it'll say the address was me
So what I really wanted all along's been camouflaged fatigue
I've been a pro, I just dodged the lead, California dreams
While we sittin' up under the Cleveland weatherin'
Wishin' for heat, I guess I need to see the leather man
Uh, I just wanna be young forever, man
Roll the Peter Pan, light it up and let's hit Neverland
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish that I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused
Tell me, is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night, I'm supposed to lose
Just ​'​cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues, Kells

You can give up like they tell you, stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​But I'm trying to tell you
Fuck what they tell you

(I think we all) ​And in these dark times
​As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It's important to know we're not blind
​We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​And I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees
If I can't live free
Right now in the world, we just need a little more love

A little more love
A little more
