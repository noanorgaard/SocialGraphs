"What I want, you know," said Mr. Tulliver,–"what I want is to give Tom a good eddication; an eddication as'll be a bread to him. That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at Lady-day. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer. The two years at th' academy 'ud ha' done well enough, if I'd meant to make a miller and farmer of him, for he's had a fine sight more schoolin' nor I ever got. All the learnin' my father ever paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and the alphabet at th' other. But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish. It 'ud be a help to me wi' these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things. I wouldn't make a downright lawyer o' the lad,–I should be sorry for him to be a raskill,–but a sort o' engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o' them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain and a high stool. They're pretty nigh all one, and they're not far off being even wi' the law, I believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i' the face as hard as one cat looks another. He's none frightened at him."
Mr. Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a fan-shaped cap (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again. At that time, when Mrs. Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St. Ogg's, and considered sweet things).
"Well, Mr. Tulliver, you know best: I've no objections. But hadn't I better kill a couple o' fowl, and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have got to say about it? There's a couple o' fowl wants killing!"
"You may kill every fowl i' the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what I'm to do wi' my own lad," said Mr. Tulliver, defiantly.
"Dear heart!" said Mrs. Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric, "how can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver? But it's your way to speak disrespectful o' my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo' me, though I'm sure I'm as innocent as the babe unborn. For nobody's ever heard me say as it wasn't lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent. Howiver, if Tom's to go to a new school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else he might as well have calico as linen, for they'd be one as yallow as th' other before they'd been washed half-a-dozen times. And then, when the box is goin' back'ard and forrard, I could send the lad a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless him! whether they stint him at the meals or no. My children can eat as much victuals as most, thank God!"
"Well, well, we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart, if other things fit in," said Mr. Tulliver. "But you mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin,' if we can't get a school near enough. That's the fault I have to find wi' you, Bessy; if you see a stick i' the road, you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it. You'd want me not to hire a good wagoner, 'cause he'd got a mole on his face."
"Dear heart!" said Mrs. Tulliver, in mild surprise, "when did I iver make objections to a man because he'd got a mole on his face? I'm sure I'm rether fond o' the moles; for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had a mole on his brow. But I can't remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole, Mr. Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole on his face no more nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire him; an' so you did hire him, an' if he hadn't died o' th' inflammation, as we paid Dr. Turnbull for attending him, he'd very like ha' been drivin' the wagon now. He might have a mole somewhere out o' sight, but how was I to know that, Mr. Tulliver?"
"No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for summat else; but niver mind–it's puzzling work, talking is. What I'm thinking on, is how to find the right sort o' school to send Tom to, for I might be ta'en in again, as I've been wi' th' academy. I'll have nothing to do wi' a 'cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it sha'n't be a 'cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i' summat else besides blacking the family's shoes, and getting up the potatoes. It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick."
Mr. Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there. Apparently he was not disappointed, for he presently said, "I know what I'll do: I'll talk it over wi' Riley; he's coming to-morrow, t' arbitrate about the dam."
"Well, Mr. Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and Kezia's got 'em hanging at the fire. They aren't the best sheets, but they're good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying 'em, only they'll do to lay us out in. An' if you was to die to-morrow, Mr. Tulliver, they're mangled beautiful, an' all ready, an' smell o' lavender as it 'ud be a pleasure to lay 'em out; an' they lie at the left-hand corner o' the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody to look 'em out but myself."
As Mrs. Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire. If Mr. Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets. Happily he was not so; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his mention of Mr. Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings.
"I think I've hit it, Bessy," was his first remark after a short silence. "Riley's as likely a man as any to know o' some school; he's had schooling himself, an' goes about to all sorts o' places, arbitratin' and vallyin' and that. And we shall have time to talk it over to-morrow night when the business is done. I want Tom to be such a sort o' man as Riley, you know,–as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o' words as don't mean much, so as you can't lay hold of 'em i' law; and a good solid knowledge o' business too."
"Well," said Mrs. Tulliver, "so far as talking proper, and knowing everything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair up, I shouldn't mind the lad being brought up to that. But them fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they wear a frill till it's all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know Riley does. And then, if Tom's to go and live at Mudport, like Riley, he'll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in, an' niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an' sleep up three pair o' stairs,–or four, for what I know,–and be burnt to death before he can get down."
"No, no," said Mr. Tulliver, "I've no thoughts of his going to Mudport: I mean him to set up his office at St. Ogg's, close by us, an' live at home. But," continued Mr. Tulliver after a pause, "what I'm a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brains for a smart fellow. I doubt he's a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy."
"Yes, that he does," said Mrs. Tulliver, accepting the last proposition entirely on its own merits; "he's wonderful for liking a deal o' salt in his broth. That was my brother's way, and my father's before him."
"It seems a bit a pity, though," said Mr. Tulliver, "as the lad should take after the mother's side instead o' the little wench. That's the worst on't wi' crossing o' breeds: you can never justly calkilate what'll come on't. The little un takes after my side, now: she's twice as 'cute as Tom. Too 'cute for a woman, I'm afraid," continued Mr. Tulliver, turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other. "It's no mischief much while she's a little un; but an over-'cute woman's no better nor a long-tailed sheep,–she'll fetch none the bigger price for that."
"Yes, it is a mischief while she's a little un, Mr. Tulliver, for it runs to naughtiness. How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning. An' now you put me i' mind," continued Mrs. Tulliver, rising and going to the window, "I don't know where she is now, an' it's pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so,–wanderin' up an' down by the water, like a wild thing: She'll tumble in some day."
Mrs. Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,–a process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair.
"You talk o' 'cuteness, Mr. Tulliver," she observed as she sat down, "but I'm sure the child's half an idiot i' some things; for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what she's gone for, an' perhaps 'ull sit down on the floor i' the sunshine an' plait her hair an' sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur', all the while I'm waiting for her downstairs. That niver run i' my family, thank God! no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter. I don't like to fly i' the face o' Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one gell, an' her so comical."
"Pooh, nonsense!" said Mr. Tulliver; "she's a straight, black-eyed wench as anybody need wish to see. I don't know i' what she's behind other folks's children; and she can read almost as well as the parson."
"But her hair won't curl all I can do with it, and she's so franzy about having it put i' paper, and I've such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th' irons."
"Cut it off–cut it off short," said the father, rashly.
"How can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver? She's too big a gell–gone nine, and tall of her age–to have her hair cut short; an' there's her cousin Lucy's got a row o' curls round her head, an' not a hair out o' place. It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I'm sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie, Maggie," continued the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this small mistake of nature entered the room, "where's the use o' my telling you to keep away from the water? You'll tumble in and be drownded some day, an' then you'll be sorry you didn't do as mother told you."
Maggie's hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her mother's accusation. Mrs. Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a curled crop, "like other folks's children," had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes,–an action which gave her very much the air of a small Shetland pony.
"Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin' of, to throw your bonnet down there? Take it upstairs, there's a good gell, an' let your hair be brushed, an' put your other pinafore on, an' change your shoes, do, for shame; an' come an' go on with your patchwork, like a little lady."
"Oh, mother," said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, "I don't want to do my patchwork."
"What! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt Glegg?"
"It's foolish work," said Maggie, with a toss of her mane,–"tearing things to pieces to sew 'em together again. And I don't want to do anything for my aunt Glegg. I don't like her."
Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr. Tulliver laughs audibly.
"I wonder at you, as you'll laugh at her, Mr. Tulliver," said the mother, with feeble fretfulness in her tone. "You encourage her i' naughtiness. An' her aunts will have it as it's me spoils her."
Mrs. Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,–never cried, when she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and from the cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted; in short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn only a little sour, they may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity undisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little too old to do without clothing. I think they must have been given to feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more and more 

Upside-down I pick wings from beetles
Pry 'em out and pin 'em to the pole over the see-saw
Sofa cobra shimmy out crater
Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension
Versus AM clock radio bangers
Downside-up in crippled acres
And still the fountainhead spittles sniglets
Quicker than quidditch seekers snatch golden snitches
You could be a part of it
Just park your bark at 20 paces
Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership
Man! the city bred the brittle cheapo
Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole
Media breather needy burrow to hide all
While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall
Curl a worm tongue tight, bitten behind the vamp chopper foaming
Lamb choppy sock puppet fear and loathing
Need phoners a.s.a.p. to build careers out of misquoting
So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives
It's a pocketful of nickels, like Cool Hand Luke decapitating
Parking meters when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills
I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
How many'd the rapists merk?
Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes
Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show
You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos
Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high note

I take it easy, the ice is thinning in the valley of the jeep beats
And when the freaks come out I hug a TV
Somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy, it's bliss

When every martian in the market holler feed me
The all-city opinion spigot leaky
You learn more when your mouth piece retreat, it's bliss
Now listen to this...oh OK
All day every day, oh all right, all night every night

Whose capitán gon' spew stale venom? Not mine...
I hung my hammock in the bedlam
And when the potentially lucrative race horse gets deaded
I'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings
But I cannot Cratchet crutch the Ebenezer limbs much longer
Flaccid flimsy songbirds, classic dizzy wrong turns
For the long term got a dragon all achy
Torn between the lending of a helping five knuckles
And a charter your own escape
Now it's like, sufferin' succotash, bucko, ducks in the chuckle patch
10-4 on that, stinger operation, wingman double back
Fuck it, Let him roam the home of the mange ridden emaciated
Slave pain cave children game
Not all players heal the same!
Learn it or don't learn shit
My radio is on regardless
I tune out pardons and tune in starlets
Carbon and pre-David/Goliath live Paleolithic bias
Who walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas
Now it's Thor dwarf war hammers, Elvin bow and arrow aimers
Documentation of the rate at which narrow tapers
Hermit crab, honest cat, trying to raise the roof in my own TV room
And still get the security deposit back
Call Ripley, Skippy
Motorhead dope fixture on some 'Go to bed, no dinner!
Hold your head, cold winter!'
Ease up out of the ghastly, desert dozer cliques stranded on cloud 8
Proud of their pogo sticks, I stay left
Along came a spider, sprung and alert, I stay def
He makes records with his tongue in the dirt
Suffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt
Buffer the mighty tighty sequins with a price on the merch
Covert Mr. Blizzard shoulder, he always acts all pissy
Plus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me
No bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye
Kill it, you are the weakest link, goodbye
I take it easy, the ice is thinning in the valley of the jeep beats
And when the freaks come out I hug a TV
Somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy, it's bliss

1 ContributorChicago’s Biggest Cypher, Ever Lyrics
This is Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade and this is Chicago's biggest cypher ever

I’m Jaym, J-A-Y-M
Weak MC's are a dime a dozen
Ask a motherfucker if he rhymes, who doesn't?
Difference between us is that I ain’t frontin'
Just because you drop bars doesn't mean you stuntin'
Nah, it doesn't mean you stuntin'
Any accolades you got don't mean nothin'
Any crew represent don’t mean nothin’
Beat my progress this year, that's really somethin’
Don't call my bluff, I got killer lines
Anything you got, I got rеaler rhymes
Yeah, and it's nеar, you should feel the sounds
'Cause my crew is sicker, we got iller minds
And we still the dons
Chasin’ Parmesan
City called this flow
Lockin' avalanche
Killin' opposition
Stayin' nonchalant
I'm the rap game's new confidant, yeah!

You might also like
I'm Fanatickiss
You ever wonder what it's like up there
Flyin' up real high
Not a moment of despair
Wish I really couldn't care
Wish I never shed a tear
But it's too late now
I gotta make up for the years
I had so much pain
I thought I'd never be the same
I really thought that there was nothing here for me to gain
Now I'm racin' to the top
Yeah, I'm tryin' to make a stain
On the fabric of time
The definition of my name
I'm a dreamer
Fanatic as a dreamer
Music in my dreams
Tell me up like a femur
I'm sick of bein' told
I'm another underachiever
I'm eager to show my haters
It's the young king's season
Believe it, I'm still dreamin'
One day the world will look past my features
'Cause real talk, I want the world to see clearer
'Cause real talk, I just wanna be a healer
'Cause my life is at stake
Yeah, my culture at stake
I was a victim of anxiety, I'm good as a flake
Don't you see it's genocide, what they do is a blake
Tell us we don't mean nothin', now that life's a mistake
To the victims of depression and these racial inequalities
I'm askin' you to join me, to combat this big atrocity
'Cause one day mentally we'll all be free
To be who we wanna be
Yeah, we are some young kings
Yo, what up? It's Motive, truth spit
Fuck with the magical spit
It's casually flippin'
Animal rhythms
Cannibalism on rappers
I kill em'
Impactin' actual tracks
On my factual activism and lackin' tactical lyrics
Of grabbin' ass to the millions, now my crew is really with it
My crew is really 'bout it
Sippin' beers with Tajín
Rollin' up packs to the loudest
I gotta go and kill em'
This game is feelin' too crowded
No room for fuckin' beginners
I mileage cats by the thousands
And yeah, it's Motive, 
They heard it's Motive, 
The kid who had a chance until he got demoted
And his teachers never gave a fuck, 'cause all he did was doze
And think about all of the shit I can have whenever I'm flowin', 
Posin' for photoshoot, Coast to coast with the shows
And ending calls with all these labels to make a toast to my bros
Vocin' and roastin'
All these spitters I don't fuck with
Haters all can suck a dick and swallow
They hopin' that I would not quit
Motive, truth spit
Get 'em, get 'em
Yo, it's Jeani
Umm, so can you tell me where the party go?
I work it out  cardio
Some kids tote mags, I just wanted an article
Y'all was on bull, I just wanted a starter coat
And it ain't gon' be the youth, tell the truth, naw
I want the crown to all of 'em 
Youngboy big dreamin' in the big cities
Life's a  but we got some pig bitties
You rappers hella cool at overachiven'
I mean, you kinda fine but can do better you Mia Kalifin'
Sittin' on the reef and I'm freestylin'
Lyrical lemonade you know I'm so stylin'

Dead president, touched bread like a, banker
Rap game tough like Aaron Sri Lanka
Nowadays , wanna talk about this and that but really they can't rap
But see I was really in the trap
Tryna flip a sack
For a thousand days straight
Now you do the math, uh-huh
That's why it sounds organic
So before day one, I got the floor plan
It's Utopia chain
The neck of Atlantis
Talkin' money, yeah
That's why you don't understand it
Five star frost blast
Right up on the canvas
Ponytail in there, I had the bandana
White girls going nuts like a old Miss Amanda
She gon' snap if you pull out the camera
Now let me do my POV
On me, on my, on me, on me
I'm Red The Rick with the three
I'm real with the recipe
Rest in peace

Earl Cobain
Hardly rest
This rap shit is twenty-four-even

Break it down in the worst way it's a middle finger and a cold shoulder
When a wrist flick you better rotate

Twitter talkin' what you gonna do are you  pretty one a daughter
'Cause I see a bitch in every one of you wrong place at the right time
To put a fresh team to your sight line you're a new  on the sideline
Need to wait your turn read the guideline prime time
You are not moving box why I've been doing
What you not doing if your bitch bashing a brick wall with juggernaut we're gonna run through it
If it's progress then I run to it
Put your forehead put a gun to it
We're the right hand to intestine get a good grip for your lungs to it
My whole squad saying don't do it
I'm just using my imagination
Doctor told me that I need a hobby
Started killing rappers for the aggravation then they gonna
Label me the GOAT  rappers never made it
Remember when I used to had a patient?
Now I'm agitated and I'm salivating
I can put a blood up in the water and you just might be the one I'm looking for
Life is in and it doesn't work so I'm still begging on heaven's door
Front gate 'cause I can't wait with some bolt cutters and a lock pick break the latch on the back door
Then run in on some mob shit, that's Y shit

I say well I was smoking on that Cinderella you were smoking ass
When you were smoking ass I was gripping on some ass
Car we said get him I'm gonna get him like a G and these  suckin' dick
Still standing on their knees teachers pushing knowledge
But I'm tryna get to college
I like 2015 and I'm only sixteen and a  always keep the flow me
Let's get it

Yo yo yo Got Lost to the Demigod
Hell nah my vibe ain't changed
Birdville demigod all day since I know that I die
I'm gonna leave a fucking legend ain't really for the talking
I'm the one who will tell you what he gonna do and do it
Since the same snakes be flake so fluently but being honest at the key
Being Turner with the leads you hear lots of ring bells in every single house
Holding the crown with it and mortal sounding the greatest around
Fuck all these birds and all these drugs
I'm playing solo with fleet in the crew and if you know we already knew
So you keep a freezer we'll keep it cooler
The purple or a ruler sit for more liquid just to go through these trials
To get off the surface I ain't playing no games 'cause greatness awaits
Belly food on that place of the moolah we chase you can't leave ducks
Never up for the stakes all of this courage was perfect in my veins
So hell nah I ain't preaching in vain kept it real since Goku turned Super Saiyan
Goddamn goddamn what the fuck you think I'm saying?
All the  sleep I'ma turn Freddy Kuger on them
Shit I'm losing my mind from wasting this time of saying why I gotta grind
So fuck it I'll show why I gotta shine feel like I got the game all in the queue
My bros might smash a chick in a zero suit just to be rude there's a whole new mode for a new type of mood
The  who destined to be stars greatness is the fuck

I'm Jordan Guilty
Hey I'm a young  from the 60s yo got hoes on call like Flavor Flav
Not a gold clapper the gold watching a 23 by my last name
That's sick shit add it up racks on racks  stack it up no sneaky shit
If you sneak diss you get dismissed if you fake as fuck
I blow trees like hurricanes and I drink beer like power yeah
I get fucked up and do dumb stuff and it get worse on my  here and I don't care what you say to me
Show me shit to get my attention look I do shit illegally
I will go to jail if they got mention look low-key many  know me
I'm also disagree pulling through the streets when I roll up weed
Motherfuck police squad roll up deep  that's that heat like D-Way to Chris Bosh
I can't fuck with fuck  they're too soft killing them drilling them
I don't really give a fuck about much I do it for the thrill the adrenaline sentimental naw sentimental
My way we kind of sewer getting high on the highway in my driveway rolling up
Pills badass bitch she let me cop bills okay
I'm never loving them you be cupping them
I'll be ducking them
I'll be fucking them undercover man look
When you great  take that spate but the flow cold like I made Lyrical Lemonade
Shout out Cole Bennet, Lyrical Lemonade

I'm Cali
Showing sweet and I'm out of my mind
Make a bad bitch tap my name on her spine
Diabolical shit I got them haters sick
Fuck your bitch right from the back
Bust on our ass then make her babysit
A lot of  talk like they colder than me
We gon' wait and see
You ever seen Marshawn Lynch dunk on LeBron?
No ‘cause he don't play out of his league
I'm outtie

Yeah man it's Rello
I say born to find the laws of gravity versus kill even casualties
No other rapper will battle me expectin' a damn catastrophe
Charge my lyrics with battery cut you up like anatomy
Sagittal day and latterly burned to be like a calorie
Speaking of anatomically style up in the astronomy
 winning awards, you  think being nominees
Hot but cold like there's just a position you honorable mention
I sit back and collect my pension
 just listen and if you don't then that's a suspension
Verses cut lyrics like circumcision
Now listen every verse I spit is meant to be taken viciously initially
I'll be spinnin' like I got a speaking deficiency
But you know that Rello would never change
I'm the bomb like Saddam Hussein left his bag on the plane
Rello

Dandy, alright
I snipe with the katana in ‘98
Dark matters say the night posted by the moon
Travel by the dune
Dandy captain of platoons
Vessel with harpoons
Take bass and lagoons
Loch Ness Andrew Lad in my cockpit
Called a locksmith clips ridin' with the optics
Fiddle with the chopsticks
Riddles for the toxic shines for the Fox's
Gas noxious
Carl Lewis, Barry Allen
I said the speed force never challenge
Check the balance it's lucky seven Kevin White
I'm in the NFL draft goin' for the past
I'm Captain Kirk in my enterprise
My fleet commit the genocide
We got you mesmerized
So ain't fuck with us I got the fuckin' ass crew and I'ma go

Nado  Crew
The domination of my city has been started if rappin' stupid
Then I guess to be retarded
Lately I've been feelin' like I've been disregarded straight
I'm chillin' back to bandwagon just departed and I missed the shit on purpose
I start my own trend  on cloud 9
I'm hanging from cloud 10
Lyrics always sound right let me prove it once again
I like to keep it all real never learn to play pretend
Damn it's only right I like the night through my mic keep an open mind
I see the world like we some Mikey nights
We the same shape but different colors and aspects but coated to this good like big bitches and spandex
Keep a big ego so everybody stay tiny
Spit it how I see it and let these bitches define me
Morals from my audit friend name ‘cause they designed me
Because a group is talking shit  don't you go excite me
‘Cause I'm a murder them my weapon is my vocal
Tryna get my point across messing with the focal
Screaming out my lyrics hear it echo like a yodel choose
Two fig' killin'  two years were global

Odigus
Uh shout out, uh
So much for your neighborhoods
Friendly cop let me holla at my bro I think it's a stock
From the corner of my eye I can tell you was actin' I don't give a fuck guy
I'ma stay saggin' and a  like me is rappin'
Stop asking questions just hit this contraption
Oh shit Uncle Buck is on the screen I could tell the pack is strong
I'm pullin' the joint flexin' like Hercules
My life defines like thirty minute Indian burns
Toss me in this class and I bet you would learn, um

Yo what up did you say Chase Williams
I'm the native hood who be fuckin' with them pilgrims
And I ain't even worried about the fuckin' millions
I'm worried about my exes call me Scott Pilgrim
And I'm breakin' points they gon' need a cast
I'm calculating passin' waiting for aftermath and makin' us forget
That we are ever fuckin' mad and our society is too fixated on eatin' ass
When people out in Boston is getting killed in past

Hey yo Isaiah G, AAP, Diamond Gang, let's fuckin' go
Yo stuck in a trap off the map with these raps
I'ma snap I'll get clapped in the back if I'm black
We could slap by the chaps with the caps and the gas
‘Cause my hats let me rap my synapses and naps
I collapse or relapse to the max if I'm lax
I'ma laugh through the cracks
I slip my  bullshit my  we dreaded
We wedded but better than in a pool pit
My  talk shit my  if you want to
Don't change that the same things gon' haunt you
Don't change that the same cops gon' taunt you
Just hang  don't fold like croissants do
Fuck the twelve I know hell know it well
I won't fail that you on my trail I won't bail
So read my mail like it's braille
When I send you all my tales while sittin' in my cell

Midas
Uh oh shit did you go ahead and slip dig dug your own grave?
At best you'll probably slay branches but I'll whip trees
Don't leave the bark backwards just to put your two face on
After the image fact or adding handicaps to cancer patient blood packs
‘Cause the riding more riding trying to ride down on this lightning but goddamn
She's damn frightened never no magic man since my closet makes
Merlin the original MJ Fox back for damn nation gamblin' with Christmas past
Throwin' coal at Hell's gates ‘cause my fosters won't last
Surfin' plasma rock smash but it's okay if you're out of your element
You're naturally gas e-gas the raps probably sounding e-gas
Profoundly man she mentioned the state of affair when you don't matter
From the womb I came smackin' Bibles out of pastor hands
Just to have your father's footloose exclaim God's damn
‘Cause Galactus bliss Atlas soul couldn't feel my shoe

Bizzaro you
All right vandalism is an art so if I rip a Kmart apart and call it modern art
I'm rich right get the green light rapping with my flaccid dick out
No stage fright and fuck the brake lights
No stoppin' got faces and no coffin
This a revolution no treaties or resolutions
Fuck a substitution this is gold it's strategic without me flock to my arm
Master of Falcon reach reverse around the galaxy
Learning things I never knew but I'm known to be prone to some cockiness
The rap game been on top of it
Used to lay around get nothing done on some Obama shit
Beat his way the room is hazy scorin' on the daily
I'm your guy Tom Brady shout out NFL Draft

Josh Onyx in this bitch
I held the black bastard
Hate is the haphazard
I wrote the book of life and this is the last chapter
The changes really coming earth needs to fat faster
For I get a gun and mess until you feel the bag faster
I'll make your ass faster
I'll make your ass Casper
I'll make your ass capture
The image of white slaves under a black master
This hell to you, I am the Hades
I'm the one who give you crack
When you need crack up in the ‘80s
And I gave that to your babies
But for me my life is gravy
While you parking in your Honda and I park in my Mercedes
And frankly I really think that you should thank me
I gave you at the hood and shit
I took you at the woods and shit
I never understood this shit
But it wasn't as good as this and I hate y'all
I really want to replace our stick to the script in the day job
It's the plate awesome make payoffs
To spend time with your girl, your kid, your boys, your bitch
‘Cause it should have genocide number eight off
I swear to God just gonna be something in a fuckin' Cape Moss
I'm tired of seeing all these bad side of face off
Do the opposite or your bitch you need to stay off my dick
I talk hard or talk honesty
Honestly you just role-playing like Connery
All the  saying they be waiting shit in heaven
If you think you in the bitter than that shit is just a banner
Keep talking when I'm planning goin' ghost
Goin' Phantom, goin' deeper than it can enlighten fuses for my cannon
Everybody can't eat and it's hope for the feminine
The feminist the heat so you burn it or you ten and god damn it

Sayadopis
Got beef ? Name the spot
I'm taking man T Weezy on talk
I just aiming pot that's why I bring the Glock
But my frame is the same as ‘Pac mixed with a little bit of Biggie
So they're waiting for my name to drop
Good nine days everybody want to talk
Later got something to say but ain't got a punt to spray
 think it's a game it's on bring them things and I ain't playing with the punts today
I'm people the trunk with case and I bring a little bit of funk to play
And ain't coming with no weak shit ‘cause I pull a heat quick and I got a deep click
So don't let me see the motherfuckers in the street bitch
I'm a man with cash and ain't taking with a man with stash
‘Cause my  feel more than that and my  get more to crack
We're getting money off lettin'  quarter try so we gotta thank the Lord for that
Before that I couldn't even afford the rap, I'm the Lord of Rap
No I'ma soon be but it's funny how my lyrics could really open doors like a room key
At the top of the chart I'ma soon be ‘cause I'm a hit hard like a boom beat

I'm OZ
The legend don't understand if you better than me
Even if they guillotine I'll still be ahead of my time don't understand me
I'm trying to apply pressure with rhyme they getting mad
‘Cause I'm the binder they don't witness the signs
Well if you brought home boy just feel within the lines
You can't feel it they mad at me ‘cause I became the villain
Tryin' to escape it's like going from hero to the villain
They mad at me I understand I make you even majesty meal
They getting mad I make your majesty yield
Talking shit about me  I'm the best that you heard
Half of these  get mad they be slurring they words
I see him defeat greet him half of them  mad
They talking about me I just wish that you do the path
What do you want to do when I'm writing these paragraphs
Then I'm off of the dome these  talking they mad the majesty
I'm magically applying pressure passing the patch
You see  getting mad trying to come patch with me
But them  can't clash with me and I'm a titan
To the day that my death come half of them  getting mad and they dead hum
They trying to get me don't understand
Making man mentally money ‘cause I'm dead yo

What's up man?
So knew the right time and I knew the right day
Showed up pretty early for the host to be late
Got a lot of dinner got a heat on my plate
Know the right time and I know my own fate
Gotta get the shoes so you know I'm mad so gotta get the butter
So you know I'm on the roll got the homie here and you know he really cold
But he ain't rap ‘cause he ain't really that old

Young Dunkin
I say I'm cooler than the polar belt without global warmin'
I spent so many bars my mic thinking the storm
Killer beat at night funeral in the mornin'
That's when we drop it and when we drop it the fans start mournin'
And night I'm wearin' all black with my nina
 you can't see me like I'm John Cena
Fight me I beat your ass in any arena
You see through like Fiji and Aquafina
Uh, now let me tell you what it look like ho
I see so much money you think I look through a kaleidoscope
And like a fat kid taking a fitness test I know the ropes
I just rap shit finesse game pop this all I know OTS a purple flag gang
You think it's Tanks rowing class I call weed sushi
I'll be smoking egg rolls you an unknown motherfucker call you John Doe
I'm a homegrown motherfucker you can call me Drew

What you trying to do?
I don't have no clue
FaceTime on I can see hey you
I saw red in the sky so blue
Only one of me let's make a pair or two
I live the place called the Chi town Chi right now
‘Cause shit I was go down when I go up there
When I go downtown my second body ‘cause they always around
It responds to be constantly constantly rocking you
Get it if you want it so do you possibly say hi to my dick wee wee
Bonjour like a fat kid he's screaming we want more it's a bird, it's a plane, whatever I'm finna saw
Let your mama yell at you
Bless the dude choice hold on let me get real serious
Tryna make reports kind of kind of furious
Chi Town for December it's more it's happening everywhere
Unarmed black man killed now I got  out here gasping for air

Fuck with me wrong can I fuck you up right
I shoot like I just don't know how to fight
Yo bitch ain't leaving I'm fucking the right
If you up on me I'm dumpin' on site
Meet you in the bein' back of the van
Two decent bitches like let's get it in
She's sucking my dick to be fucking her free
And these bitches be lovin' me that's on the fiend
I'd be so high I'm on top of the earth
You  bitches don't forget your purse
Come to your funeral shoot up your hearse
If you're talking the most I'll do you the worst
I play with them hammer since I can remember
 freeze up like the month of December
Choppin' shit down never your timber
King of the jungle I took it from simple remember them times
We brawled on the block I said “fuck fighting and when brought a Glock”
First  tried me I left him in shock
‘Cause I'm salty my homie caught up to the top

I'm Thanos with an infinity gauntlet
My temper is what you have daunted
Leave your mother's house haunted
Up smash when leave you taunted
First you want you to want to enter flaunted
Now you (don't want to enter I'm gonna make you stomp it
I'm rising and destroying this shit just change my name to tsunami
Make a sandwich add a slice of salami
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying
It's just rap shit what I'm spraying
I spent hot shit like I tried the Buffalo blazing challenge
I rise to the challenge and I kill it like everything was below the challenge
And I'm done

I say come
Come sip this lyrical lemonade
 like we've been a renegade
Since like the age of eight
I ain't give a fuck about a  that's like any day
Look at my watch I ain't got the time to play
Um  I'm just authentic and any motherfucker that ain't fucking with me
You could get a dick straight to the throat I ain't playing no homo
I ain't really with that fuck shit but I swear to God that it could go wrong
Um  like me to say
Hold on let me take my breath
I'm trying to do this too quick  like me man I'm a nuisance
Motherfucker like me bought a brand new shit but took my  back to Africa
I ain't playing with these  boy I'm half as accurate
But if I shoot with a AK this shit a man

I say excuse my flow man I seem to be on some other shit
Shorty text me say she leaving so I text my other bitch
Upgrade went from fitted cats with the snapbacks but now I walk around and ate daily with a skull cap
But I'm still wearing dark colors call that all black catch a opp crunch his ass up
Like a dog snack and I'll never eat I keep weed in my lunch sack
‘Cause I let his cheese like a critter I'm a snatch that
And bitch I need my money quick I ain't got time to wait and pussy  think it's a game
I don't really play stay for stay strapped like the Tomb Raider
We are running to your house call us the home invaders
And we carry big cannons like from Space Rangers
My squad is some monsters and I can't really tame ‘em

Bitch I'm Patrick Bateman
Not another normal  I go dumb like X is missin'
Chromosome hold the phone how I'm not the best new kid but your head is bobbin'
Marvin Martian no face mobbin' you find out when our space droppin'
Shit Jake solo never solo day like oh no bitch we fuck now
I'm Mobb Deep we yellin squad 31st of warm and I like demise
You know I went out pull up on a  caught out working out
Then I'm swole as hell pocket so fat they're like oh well
Maybe next time humans don't spit fire
What am I?

My hoes before sweaty our name
April I got your bitch ‘cause your bitch got in line
Question if you want better yet check my line
A nickname for my phone is calling number nine
Four and I'm need a watch to get back that wasted time
‘Cause my finesse it won't stop till I see that rest sign
I'm talking all caps visible in both of my eyes

All right I'm Spacey
It's the unknown untold bars cold
Lyricists remember this as if it was in the book of Genesis
Generally I don't give a fuck about a nemesis
Nemeses intellectually I'm a Socrates
Girls finer bro you must be kidding me she's played with more balls than Leah no messy soccer cleats
Middle school told them not to pick on me
Now I'm telling the same dudes to pick up their dignity
Shout out my brother enemy co-founder JLC him Trez and Rep the only dudes who believed in me
So for them I'm going to fucking bury a gladiator mentality
Drag these rappers by my chariot carry it
I'm on my Marshawn Lynch those skittles in her mouth
She want that rainbow bitch you're a drought
You ain't gonna rain on shit keep fucking around
You go hear that nina click greatness is what I'm destined for
I'll settle for perfection they say Spacey can't rap
Fuck your misconceptions I'm addressing some things that need addressing
So if your girl at the club you know she started dressing
This the return better yet rebirth homies acting like they better do
Maybe you should rehearse keeping things trill
You know how we do that my homies ran train
She's taking the caboose shit times flown by
I ain't got wings so they wonder I'm fly
I want to be the dopest for a moment or a while like just spitting in a room
Homies vibing off the style my flows a patient killer
I'm on the crocodile, Steve Irwin in the game I just seem to tame the wild

King Size papes has fuck roll the eighth up
$100 shirt bitch I'm baped up
PvP on the come up we doing it take the game chop it up
Bitch I'm fucking screwing it
Screw it light a doobie and I'm a motherfucker just like my manic moody is
Girl let me see that gluteus, pink bullet super classy some studious
Yo this is me I suppose steal a flame we take your bitch and then we take the game
Smack your heart in the shit that killed Cobain with these J's on my feet
Yeah my site was complete my pole game strong but these bitches are weak
So my pole game strong ‘cause fuck I'm so flea
My pole game strong bitch it ain't low-key
And I'm spitting these rhymes going hella hard
My standards are low but I ain't fucking a lot
I just wish you would know who we are
It's the rap and masturbate only busting our bars

That Could Be Fiction follow me hit me up
All right give me sixteen bars double sixteen bars
Just enough to zip use this and blow these charges
What I'm taking no demand in mind I'm gon' take it
No mistake in metaphors I'm missing minutes maybe might have been that way
You got acquainted to a past me but now there ain't no damn move
Used to move past me so pass me a cup or whatever's in hand
Until we both sober up and realize I was on that point never nada
I've been gifted with bravado the drive to make a killing in any industry I step in
Up two occasions to pass myself to make some hot shit for all those out there
Sitting waiting you want to comprehend the spark
That's in my brain shit me too
I've been asking the same
Hold up let me preface this next part shame on me
For talking shit and stepping with real bars
‘Cause ain't nobody this unique with lyrical content
That I got no contest not content
‘Til I drop that ill shit so dick heads spun round like Ric Flair did
Must miss my reference we wound then you bled it
Like oh damn let me hear that again
That's it man

This is for my competition smoke to keep track of my fitness
All I wanted was the riches but I heard it lead to snitchin'
Money, money, money I ain't got time for no opposition
Money, money, money, I ain't got time for no opposition
Now I'm on the paper chase hoping I could get some green emo say keep it industry
Probably for the best of me grew up around dope
How you think I know the recipe and mama was a pro
Sold drugs to take care of her seed

I told these niggas don't fuck with my team
We run up on them like know everything 357 equipped with the beam
If he do not listen put one of his beam
Bro on the scene ready to shoot I know my bro bro that bitch like a flute
Best tell your people to buy you a suit
If he won't you'll take your head out the roots
Right in the whip blowing the loud park walk up and just blow in the crowd
Always be looking like shorty no wow
They let me out the cage and I'm on the prowl
Hunt like a hound dumping that .30 scope on that bitch
Got my shit looking nerdy I'll do my thing and just leave in a hurry
Ain't none of them clean all my bankers be dirty

It's my second time the second comin'
I know I'm up and runnin'
But I'm trying to be the first place  so I'm gunnin' for the top
And if a  try to stop me I'm gonna stomp him
Don't understand it they're getting mad because my standards reach past Stanford don't understand if you man
I'm trying to live a manner excuse my manner the house too big
Don't get mad ‘cause your mouth too big put the gun inside of that and leave a hole in your back
The  mad at me I know they massive ‘cause I attack
Massive attack we're not attached to massive catastrophe
Catastrophe they trying to attach to me don't get it twisted
Young OG came through to reign supreme
Don't even matter I could blaze your team in one verse
Don't get it twisted your young boys is better since birth
Been better since birth embedded my own lines into it
All lies into it you rapping but you putting your own lives into it
So don't fuck with me they can't function
See I've been the best ever since I stepped out of the womb
 talking about me I want gold on the tomb
Half of them  mad talking shit about me
In the hotel homie you can't even get a room

I say I came down like hold up
Miss Cope with baking soda
Then start selling boulders
Cat wraps up in my folder
‘Cause what's my body older
I never live like sober drinking without a coaster
Life got shit ups and downs not right that rollercoaster
I'll flex that ball never worry about talking I never been a bolster
Homo bread in the toaster
Got no skateboard I grind though these guns ain't got no hostler
But I tote them on my side bro
OMG the CEO of AIE it's TTU that's OMB
I laugh at push  FSC SMA to FAKE
NWA search 243 RNS to SMG will end yo shit ASAP
But that's nothing dumb broke  don't know nothing
So let me tell you something the difference
Between my nothin' and your nothin'
Is that my nothin' is your something and your something just plain nothin'
Even if you had something, it still don't compare to my nothin'
That will never change
Wearin' black all everything
Lookin' at you like that's a shame
I'm the hottest came match the flame
Young Infamous, that's the name

Yo, I already smashed
Well, I'm blessed for what I have
Only deep inhales, on that blunt, I tend to gasp
I'm in the lab working out
Got my pen to the pad
The rap's getting toned
Fuck biceps and abs
Need a shawty with a ass, who ain't afraid to hit the ab
If the law rolled up, baby girl got it stashed
Deep in her vagina or somewhere in her crack
Me, I'm at the telly getting high watching M.A.S.H
Bob Barker, skinny on the microphone
Tyson Strong, I'm sick of waiting ‘til Mike was on to get mine
They ain't heard what I'm writing on
This ain't for y'all, it's for my dudes still fighting, homes
This ain't for y'all, it's for my dudes with them Nikes on
 in the cell, twenty-five to life us, homes
Selling dope to get them panned, but keep them license on
Flight school, you ain't even got your license though
Just get it right before you and your buddies get left
It's getting neck except Lil' Mama had the strap
Advil in her purse, Bacardi gold on the breath
I ain't scared of nothing
Got them double D's on her chest
It's off the easy like him hands balling at the rec
If she can foul, no call, don't look at the ref
Over-stressed to perfect, going in like the cess
Hit us next to back, we keep them on deck
Yeah, your two-seamer ain't smiling, my hands slicked back
I'm the old Pat Riley
In the coach's box, ring zone, and I'm smiling
Send you in information if his ass start wildin'
Starts having a night from range, but he dialed in
Already six deep, and that range getting piled in
Bought the French tips, now they all want to find him
We all want to eat
We just trying to decide when

281, just called my pops
He like, “how you keeping up?”
I'm rolling blunts, that's my skunk
Yeah, they fat, yeah, bitch, they plump
Not with that shit, but with the shit
So I'm shooting shit, I'm taking pics
It's a bag of tricks, I burn it down
I'm doing flips, I'm with your bitch
I'm taking flight, they just asked Mike
I'm feeling nice, I grab the dice
I need the dove, finesse the plug
I am the plug, go catch the sub
These  bugs, I'm not a thug
Box a , get the gloves
Dr. Gov, I get the love up in these streets
Chasing goofies in these streets
Need that sauce, it's not for free
See, that's just for me
Shout out 
Bitches know that I'm the one
Rolling fat bags of the fun
Don't bring the guns, the night is young
If it's a problem, bitch, we swung on them 
Looking through the tinted glass, I see the glass
I'm blowing grass, my seat is back, I need the pack
We built a house of lies, where Mr. Cheeto at?
Don Cheeto that
Ryan flipped the pack, he kicking shit like where the FIFA at
Won't beat me though, ‘cause that 3-0 shit dead
They had prom at the shed, I couldn't go, kicked out the door
Don't talk no more, my eyes is low, can't even see, just leave me be
Bitch, that's the key
And that's the key

Look, look
Let me start off by thanking the man above
‘Cause unlike the rest of the world, he always show me love
I remember coming up, getting made fun of
Now I'm like them stairs of Rocky, the way them bitches run up
And man, it's crazy
Successful one-way street
But it's funny how  still turnt on me
But it's cool, got no problem with letting my circle shrink
‘Cause real  don't hate on each other, nah, they linked
That's why I'm riding around the city with them motherfuckers gang
But them  don't let you get close enough to touch my chain
And don't let me see you girl, cause oh man, that's tragic
Have her all down my line like a damn pageant
My  Fred Finessa, how you thinking this magic?
Take her to the crib and stretch that like elastic
My  Tay got grade A, the fiends say it's fantastic
My  Riley on the beat, I'm on the beat
My  Riley in the street, putting beats in the casket, man
And it's not a game, bro
My  Ricky say aim for the top, and don't you aim low
And all this shit'll be ours
And if I fuck that bitch, I bet she rain showers
Oh, it's like that? Yeah, it's like that
Fuck my money up in the D-Gang, but I'm right back
And if you pass up on the B for Reed, that's your biggest mistake
Wanting them like a master's degree, you always be straight
 try and keep up with me, but I'm not a Kardashian
Keep my pockets filled up, like my car's gas
At this point, me be on my way
My  Riley bein' the best, ain't that far-fetched
My team don't work for Nike, but we got our checks
If you seen the shit I seen, you'd probably be blind
But that just made my vision of success a straight B-line
And  always talkin' shit, but it's always from behind
Half of them mad, I just killed they girls feline

Okay, my , alright, hold up
Y'all, say they know Karali finna be a star, so they chasing me just like an astronaut
I'm the realest , I'ma stay the same, and that's somethin' you ain't gotta ask about
Like I'm a bad teacher, give a fuck about your questions or your opinions
These lame rappers, these Twitter haters, get the fuck up out my mansion
I'm a lyrical assassin, somebody pay me to kill this pen
You fuckin' around with dragons, it's never heat that a  spit
Get up in the game, the better than my Tokus
Take out or out, you  better stay focused
We takin' over like we puttin' ourselves in the game
A nigga cannot hang, we number one in the game
Young as hell, but I swear I been doin' this
Haters hate, but they all losin'
Swear they like to talk, knowin' they on ball
These shot  is real goofy
I know hella rappers, it's fake as hell
And they talkin', shootin' like they bout shit
Sit down, you a fake trapper
You knowin' that you not on shit
Eighteen, but I'ma kill these 
I spit that vicious, why you actin' scared?
Talkin' down, and I swear they down
But I swear to God that I ain't never care
Never finna catch a  lackin'
If I know they plottin', I'ma be prepared
While I'm grindin', that ain't never stoppin'
They can't even kill me with the fuckin' chair
Droppin' islands like I went to Hobbiton
It's funny, ‘cause a  just startin'
I swear it's caution when a  walkin'
People must flockin' ‘cause they know I'm ballin'
Better ask about him, ‘cause I'm takin' off
Know I'm startin' when I'm gettin' to it
And I'm stoppin', startin' when I'm finna do it
All these locals lyin', man, they ain't shootin'
Real stat, I feel shy
Rap is to people dyin' like everyday
Only thing upon these  minds, I'ma get money, I'ma let it spray
That's terrible, but that's just the way that these kids thinkin' at an early age
Tell everybody in the city, dad, that won't change, it's the only way
When I get a combination, everybody's safe
These  only ball up in 2K
Take a shot, but these boys still got aim
Click, clack, bang, they miss like Jackie, Lil' Wayne
I ain't big, but in my city, boy, I got a name
In these rappers' eyes, I swear I got a lot of hate
Yeah, they hatin' ‘cause they fear my name
When they see Karali, they lose they brain like flow crack
But I don't fuck with rocks, and they claim they real, but I swear they not
Hella rappers to feast
They don't know well for me to go beast mode
I eat those who eat foes
Don't need those if I got myself
Killin' flows, I convey your belts
It's the hottest shit that y'all done ever felt
!

Let me tag in, bro
Let me tag in, let me tag in
I can spit it
Yeah, one with that
Alright, look, I'm tired of playin' around with you dummies
The rap game fucked up, I guess that's why I'm comin'
Get on the beat and act the ass like Eddie Murphy
My flow too raw, I just hope I don't catch herpes
I done seen  change up just like Kirby
 ain't ballin' so they tryin' change up jerseys
But me? Man, I keep it one hundred
Never change with my 
Lord, it's worth more than money
The young boy came through and dropped it like LeBron did
And your single ain't shit if you ain't got re-up on it
A  spit crack, they tryin' re-up on it
And like the next season of Empire, my dick, everybody tryin' be up on it

That's 

You and Fresco always end your bars with "different" that has to change
How the fuck can you both be different when you rap the same?
Yo, but I know what he's thinking, I'm someone he may not beat
So he'll write, "How I Beat The Real Champ" on an A1 sheet
Well this is A1 covers versus A1 beef
Had my Ah Ha moment, jump in the picture like Take On Me
So here's my take on you, see in Grind Time you were raking hits
Went to King Of The Dot, after shady biz made it sink
Tried to get on Smack and they vaulted all his greatest vids
Someone fire shots online that made him split like Agent Smith
Smack and Beasley airing it, saying that he'd take the piss
Left him in the cold so he crawled back to Canadians
His stock dropped to rock bottom, they don't have to pay him shit
This rapper's so salty you'd think he'd be worth his weight in it
So you can fuck around and be on 100,000 leagues
He like a PC game cause he running out of Steam
Now they starved this cunt, got him spitting bars for crumbs
It's David Dickinson, he went from a real deal to a bargain hunt
He was wack for a while, now he's someone that a few feel
I'm acting like a Tory I'm getting rid of the New Deal
Acting like Hitori these blades that are being sniffed cut different
Fuck bitches cause I made it to beat tricks
You get Cyssero Philly flowed, one, two give and go
These Glasgow Kisses won't be underneath the mistletoe
We seen what happened with A. Ward, everything that Christian wrote
Had that teacher lost for words like The DaVinci Code
Cause you ain't been the same now all your former friends departing
Now this ain't something all is head or Hearts in like a cross from Hendrik Larsson
Boy I'm dunzo with Americans you get kicked to the door
And after this, don't come north of England no more
And tell Donald Trump he can't visit the course he paid millions for
I barred the shit out of Real Deal, then have my leader bar the shit out of yours!

I said I'm Maximus in this arena
He's feeling extra bold like when in Rome I let him Crowe
This time the Scot(t) won't make it, that shit was extra cold
Gladiator, Rome, a Scot wasn't in it but one did direct it though
Ridley Scott, you dig me? Watch
 fuck it bro I'll set the tone
As far as my perspective goes? If it's respect, respect is shown
I mean he the Last King Of Scotland and to me he never left the throne
You got a nation on your back? You studied his formula you pathetic ho
Mixed in some diet Pesci flow, look at you, looking sheepish
Hold up, wait (weight), like a dolly that makes you Dolly a genetic clone
Power punches, keep swinging, til something clicks like a metronome
You act like you fly cause the shit is over your head, well we know Jed the drone
Fuck just killing Soul, on my soul I'm killing every soul you've ever known
Base it on the fact I got guns 'round my circle like the Technodrome
All that talking? You Macaulay Culkin
You got a buzz bro, but you Kevin though that makes your fam' McCallister
They take flight and boy here gets left alone to protect his home
It's man to man, you thought your team had it covered like a defensive zone
A ginger bitch, wondering, "Where's The Help?" like Emma Stone
Fuck yo' clan's rep, fam', set and Jed's Scottish pride
I'll bring people through Fife willing to do life and your land gets colonized
Hands get clamped around this man's neck, homicide
You can't play with Trevor, this ain't Grand Theft Auto Five
Hold on, I'm sorry I'm out of pocket cause he battled in Canada
Please Jed, tell us one more time and remind us
You're like the faggot that goes to an amusement park, rides the ride
Then gets the shirt that says he survived it
You only did that so you could come back
And every match with peers you can fucking brag all fucking year to 'em
Y'all remember that old Soul with that warrior's mindset?
It's the same one acting so cavalier's ruined
I built a rap career off of what you spent the last two year doing
Drinking Vladimir until I turn Vladimir Putin
So the fact you have a title is not appealing
Tony vacated it and you won it over some roster filling
The last American you battled didn't end well, you looked suicidal when Caustic kill him
I'm surprised we didn't find the champ hung by his own belt like Robin Williams
To be the champ you gotta beat the champ, that's the adage I've learned
Til Tony made you take a number of all the hungry battlers he's spurned
I'm a fucking gym teacher, it's not impressive as far as having a bachelors is concerned
But I have a title too, Mr. Weller...pussy at least that's one I actually
