And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing, dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
But I'll have a blue, blue ChristmasYou might also
