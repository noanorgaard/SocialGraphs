Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad
Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad
But then, one day, I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

The biggest word you ever heard, and this is how it goes:
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay

He traveled all around the world and everywhere he went
He'd use his word, and all would say, "There goes a clever gent!"

When Dukes or Maharajas pass the time of day with me
I say me special word, and then they ask me out to tea

Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay!

You know you can say it backwards, which is "dociousaliexpilisticfragicalirupus"... but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?

Indubitably!

So when the cat has got your tongue, there's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word, and then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully, or it could change your life
For example...

Yes?

One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's my wife
Oh, and a lovely thing she is, too

She's....
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

When you sing, you begin with do-re-mi
Do-re-mi

Do-re-mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi

Do-re-mi

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
(spoken)
Oh, let's see if I can make it easier

Do, a deer, a female deer
Re, a drop of golden sun
Mi, a name I call myself
Fa, a long, long way to run
So, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow so

That will bring us back to do, oh, oh, oh

That will bring us back to do
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

Now children, do, re, mi, fa, so, and so on are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads, you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up like this
(sung)
So, do, la, fa, mi, do, re
(spoken)
Can you do that?

So, do, la, fa, mi, do, re

So, do, la, ti, do, re, do

So, do, la, ti, do, re, do

Now put it all together

So, do, la, fa, mi, do, re
So, do, la, ti, do, re, do

Good

But it doesn't mean anything

So we put in words, one word for every note, like this
(sung)
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
(spoken)
Together

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Do, a deer, a female deer

Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
