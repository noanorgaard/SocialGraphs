It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treatin' my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed 'til the end

It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, oh, oh, oh

It's not in the words that you told me, yeah
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free

It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
Rosanna
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna, yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah
Meet you all the way
Meet you all the way, Rosanna yeah

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
Rosanna
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

I hear the drums echoin' tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waitin' there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
