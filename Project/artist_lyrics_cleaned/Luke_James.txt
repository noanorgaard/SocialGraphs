For all the love you give to me
How could I ever repay
I owe you, I owe you, I owe you
For everything you've done for me
How could I ever repay
I owe you, I owe you
I owe you
Honey dipped kisses, you grant all my wishes
You rescued me in the nick of time
You saved my life Whoa OOOOOOO
You might also likeBaby ain’t nobody else in my vision
Only loving you is my mission
You give me a reason to live right
Won’t find nothing better in this life
And when the rain was pouring down
You came and cleared my gray clouds
Oooooh Yeah
I’ll owe you forever
I’ll owe you forever

I’m forever indebted
Couldn’t have done it without your help
I love you and don’t you forget it
Maybe even more than I love myself
Baby for everything we’ve been through
There’s nothing that I just won’t do
Cause I owe, I owe you
