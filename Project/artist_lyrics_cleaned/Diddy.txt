Yeah, this right here, tell me why
C'est destiné à tous ceux qui ont perdu quelqu'un
Qu'ils aimaient vraiment, allez écouter ça

J'ai l'impression qu'hier on faisait vibrer le spectacle
J'ai inséré la chanson, tu as stoppé le flow
Loin de traîner dans la rue pour de l'argent
Notorious, ils doivent savoir que
La vie n'est pas toujours ce qu'elle semble être
Les mots ne peuvent pas exprimer ce que tu signifiais pour moi
Bien que tu sois partis, nous sommes toujours une équipe
A travers ta famille, j'accomplirai tes rêves, c'est vrai (c'est vrai)
Dans le futur, je ne peux pas attendre de voir
Si tu ouvres les portes pour moi
Je me rappelle parfois, la nuit ou il ont pris mon ami
Try to black it out, but it plays again à traduire
Quand c'est réel, les sentiments sont durs à cacher
Ne peux imaginer toute la douleur que je ressens
Je donnerai n'importe quoi pour entendre une petite respiration de ta part (Respiration)
Je sais que tu vis encore ta vie après la mort
You might also like
Chaque décision que je fais, chaque pas que je fais
Chaque jour, chaque fois je prie
Tu me manqueras
En pensant au jour où tu es parti
Quelle vie à prendre, quelle serment à briser
Tu me manqueras

It's kinda hard with you not around à traduire
Know you in heaven smilin' down à traduire
En nous regardant, pendant que nous prions pour toi
Chaque jour nous prions pour toi
Jusqu'au jour où l'on se reverra
C'est dans mon cœur que je te garderai mon ami
La mémoire me donne la force dont j'ai besoin pour continuer
La force dont j'ai besoin pour croire
My thoughts Big I just can't define à traduire
Je voudrais pouvoir faire tourner les aiguilles à l'envers
Nous dans la sixième, achetant de nouveaux vêtements et des baskets
Toi et moi se tapant sur l'épaule
Faisant un carton, des plateaux TV où ils te recevaient
Je n'arrive toujours pas à y croire que tu es partis
Je donnerai n'importe quoi pour entendre une petite respiration de ta part
Je sais que tu vis encore ta vie après la mort
Chaque décision que je fais, chaque pas que je fais
Chaque jour, chaque fois je prie
Tu me manqueras
En pensant au jour où tu es parti
Quelle vie à prendre, quelle serment à briser
Tu me manqueras

Que quelqu'un me dise pourquoi
Un matin
Quand la vie est finie
Je sais
Que je reverrai ton visage

Chaque nuit je prie,chaque décision que je prends
Chaque pas que je fais, chaque jours unique
Chaque nuit je prie,chaque décision que je prends
 Chaque jour qui passe
Chaque mouvement que je fais, chaque jour unique
 Is a day that I get closer
 To seeing you again
Chaque nuit je prie, chaque décision que je prends
 Tu nous manques B.I.G et nous n'arrêterons pas
Chaque pas que je fais, chaque jours unique
 Car nous ne pouvons pas nous arrêter… c'est vrai
Chaque nuit je prie, chaque décision que je prends
Chaque pas que je fais, chaque jours unique
 Tu nous manques 

Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's gon' make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force, fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)

Someone who truly understands (Oh, yeah) how to treat a man
(How to treat a man, baby) This is what I need

Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on, ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime, you'd be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario, talk to e'm
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leakin' in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred-foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl, I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you, I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl
This is what I need (Yes, I do)
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me, girl
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
This is what I need (Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me (Make the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe (And maybe, maybe we)
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me, girl
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face, baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man

Fronting like Bad Boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
This fed time outta town pie flipper
Turn Cristal into a Crooked I sipper
Everbody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)
I'm through with bein' a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her

Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high

Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo, I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life
I'm like, "Damn, how these niggas got they trust?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?"
Do you think you snake me, 'cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D Player Hater's Degree? (haha)
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down, ohh no

Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black and famous with money hangin' out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet
