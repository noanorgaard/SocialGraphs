Ain't a cloud in the sky ain't a worry on my mind
Looks like we're in the clear, clear, clear
Just-a living the life cooler in the sunshine
Watching that ice disappear peer peer

And doing nothing to crazy
Just getting lawn chair lazy
It's the party of the year sitting right here
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer

Touchdown
It's Sunday all day no ones got nowhere to be
Right now
We're twist off sipping and we're hashtag winning
And the drinks just hit me, I'm feeling tipsy
Next point going to get itself
Got a lime in the bottle, off this bottle
Can I get, can I get a refill

Ain't a cloud in the sky, ain't a worry on my mind
Looks like were in the clear, clear, clear
Just a living the life, cooler in the sunshine
Watching that ice disappear peer peer

And doing nothing to crazy
Just getting lawn chair lazy
It's the party of the year sitting right here
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer

Man it's a hot one
Somebody pass me a cold one
'Till were down to the last one
'Till were feel, feel, feeling alright

Ain't a cloud in the sky ain't a worry on my mind
Looks like were in the clear, clear, clear
Just a living the life cooler in the sunshine
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer
Ain't a cloud in the sky ain't a worry on my mind
Looks like were in the clear, clear, clear
Just a living the life cooler in the sunshine
Watching that ice disappear peer peer
And doing nothing to crazy
Just getting lawn chair lazy
It's the party of the year sitting right here
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer

Alright
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer
Man it's a hot one
Somebody hand me a beer, beer, beer
Till were down to the last one
Somebody hand me a beer, beer,
