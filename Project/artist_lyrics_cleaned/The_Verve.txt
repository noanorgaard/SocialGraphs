No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)

Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?
I can't change it you know, I can't change it

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
Trying to make ends meet
Trying to find some money, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

You know I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
You've gotta change my mould, no, no, no
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(It's just  sex and violence, melody and violence)
(It's just sex and silence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)

(It's just sex and violence, melody and violence)
Ever been down
(I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no)
Ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been 

And I hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

But I know I'm on a losing streak
'Cause I passed down my old street
And if you want a show, then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again

Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

'Cause, baby, ooh, if Heaven calls
I'm coming too, just like you said
You leave my life, I'm better off dead

All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down

Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

'Cause baby, ooh, if Heaven calls
I'm coming too, just like you said
You leave my life, I'm better off dead

But if you want a show, then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again

Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh, Lord
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh, Lord
I'm never coming down, no, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, no, I'm never coming down
