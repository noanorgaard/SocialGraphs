I remember, back on the 'Long Distance Runner' tour
Me, Supreme, and Large did the ultimate show
Ultimate meaning last, and so emotional...
It was Joseph's show
He had cancer, and not much time left
His last wish was to see us live, before he left
When we played 'Last Song', the whole crowd was crying
...and i felt like this music's a matter of living and dying

The songs
Will live on
Because you made them yours
Made them yours

You ain't gone
Forever in my thoughts
In my thoughts 

This lady started by saying that her daughter's best friend was so sick
Stomach something, doctors can't tell what it is
But it's been three months in a hospital bed
And it's been real hard, not knowing what's ahead
For us all, and especially for her, of course
She was sad that she missed
All of your shows
Last summer, but we opened up the balcony door
So she heard you from afar, fantasizing about meeting you all
I said ''that could be done, just let me know what to do, i write something on her website, too
I mean it's easy for me, and if it means anything to her
I'm just blessed to touch somebody else's world''
I got a thank-you-mail
Send some autographs over, 'hope you get well soon'
Probably forgot about it, because it felt like a shock, when i got the terrible news 
I'm just writing this to let you know 
That our fight here is over
She had to go
At least now her pain is gone, and she's somewhere better, smiling
...man, i felt like this music's a matter of living and dying

The songs
Will live on
Because you made them yours
Made them yours
My friends
You ain't gone

He made his
Ultimate playlist
Thinking 'this is what i wanna listen to, when the train hits
My life, i can't take it
So let me take my life' 
Feeling alone and abandoned
Mp3-player on 'random'
That's why he took it as a sign
That some kind of god thought that it wasn't his time
When he looked at the tunnel, and the train that came through
He heard the first notes of 'The Struggle Continues'
The title track changed his train of thought, and  stepped off the train tracks

The songs
Will live on
Because you made them yours
Made them yours
My friends
You ain't gone
Forever in my thoughts
In my thoughts
