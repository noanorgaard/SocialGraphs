Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
You might also like
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or 

She's fast, she's loud
Looks pretty damn good with her top off
She cleans, look nice
You can still see her shine with the lights off

And I'll bring the wheels, you bring the heat
See how it feels in the shotgun seat

Girl, let's fly, jump inside
Take a ride in my Trans Am
Hammer down, cruise around
Rock this town in my Trans Am
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Girl, you know you wanna ride
Take a ride in my Trans Am

I wanna see your jet black hair
Blowin' in the wind with your hands up
I wanna hug those curves
And show you what this motor's made of
You might also like
Grindin' the gears, 8-track blastin'
I wanna hear you screamin' faster

Girl, let's fly, jump inside
Take a ride in my Trans Am
Hammer down, cruise around
Rock this town in my Trans Am
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Girl, you know you wanna ride
Take a ride in my Trans Am

(Woah)
Come on, baby (Woah)
Let's take a little ride
(Woah)
Mmm (Woah)

We can roll the reds, outrun the blues
White lines blurring by, baby, me and you
Let's roll the reds, outrun the blues
White lines blurring by, baby, me and you
(Everybody wants to ride)
Girl, let's fly, jump inside
Take a ride in my Trans Am
Hammer down, cruise around
Rock this town in my Trans Am
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Everybody wants to ride (Hey)
Girl, you know you wanna ride
Take a ride in my Trans Am

(Woah, hey, woah)
In my Trans Am
(Woah, hey)
In my Trans Am
(Woah, hey)
Take, take a ride (Woah)
In my Trans 

This life would kill me if I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you, baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
This life would kill me if I didn't have you

You are my heart, every breath I breathe
And I'm safe in your arms, you rescue me
When I'm weak, you're strong
If you were gone I don't know where I'd be
You were made for me
You were made for me

This life would kill me if I didn't have you
I couldn't live without you, baby
I wouldn't want to
If you didn't love me so much
I'd never make it through
'Cause this life would kill me
