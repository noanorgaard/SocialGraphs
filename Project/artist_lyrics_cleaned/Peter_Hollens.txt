Cause you'll be in my heart (You'll be)
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on (From this day on)
Now and forever more (You'll be here just like you were before)
You might also likeYou'll be in my heart
No matter what they say (Doesn't matter at all)
You'll be here in my heart
Always (You're in my heart)

Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

And you'll be in my heart (You'll be here)
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on (From this day on)
Now and forever more (You'll be here just like you were before)

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know (What do they know?)
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know
When destiny calls you, you must be strong (You've got to be strong)
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together
Cause you'll be in my heart (You'll be)
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on (From this day on)
Now and forever more (You'll be here just like you were before)
Oh, you'll be in my heart (You'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there)
Always (Here in my heart - I'll be)

Always
I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there
