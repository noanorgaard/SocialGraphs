When it's 4AM in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will

How can I hold you so close
When I'm thinking of somebody else?
How can I treat you so right
When I know that you're only the help?
The reason you're here is to deal with my fear
I hate being alone
How can I do this to you
Yet you still always answer the phone?

I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never will

I'll be your favorite worst mistake
You'll be a night to fill the space

When it's 4AM in the morning
I've been thinking about my past again and
You should know, I don't want your love
Never have, never will
When it's 4AM and I call you
You can tell that I've been drinking when I say
You should come, take it off, all off
Help me get over her
You should know, I don't want, your love
Never have, never
