Man I just  (woo)
Woke up from a coma  (yeauh)
I'm scaring the fakes the fear In the air
I love the smell and the aroma  (uh huh)
These actors check they personas
I turn they bodies to a donor  (uh huh)
Expose your verses as some loaners  (uh huh)
Ya impact erased, they fallen from grace
They went from Rome to a roamer  (gang)
I’m reading the signs, and killing some cancers nickname is melanoma  (word)
Graduated from slime, to getting some antlers
Slick change for a cobra
That’s a stick change in a rover
And I lick flames to get colder
Spit like big bang from a soldier
Shoot like Richmond at 0:04
I’m a wizard on paper so these verses keep penning themselves
You come up with nothing, your lines dime a dozen,  I see that your pen is a penny to wealth
Momma been hustling, her children been hustling, we steady avoiding how penniless felt  (yeah we do)
People say they can tell I been growing, i think its bout time i start telling myself

(uh)
Y’all are not ready for the words how they coming out (nope)
Not ready for the verse how it’s coming out (nope)
Not ready for the swerve when I come around (nope)
Put the hearse in the dirt 6 feet under ground (nope)
Absurd how I murdered the run around (yeauh)
Album soon, take its turn, then I’m ducking down (yeauh)
I’ll come back and go berserk when the summer’s out (yeauh)
I’ll come back and go berserk when the summer’s out (yeauh)

I get home and go berserk (yeah)
Ivy League kicked my ass
I used to skip class So I could go to work
Hell nah girl I ain't go in yo purse
I ain't even do that with my momma
And why would I cheat on my girl?
I don't even cheat on my barber
Lover ask for a last dance
Balling while I'm sick got me feeling like the flu game
Depression gotta Nigga in a cage like Luke
Mortal Kombat got me feeling like I'm Liu Kang (uh)
Jax want a verse by the morn (by the morn)
I'ma get it back like karma
Tell em I'm Sharpe like Shannon
And tell em that ain't no problem

I'm heading into a hiatus, (what)
I’m giving you room to breathe
I'm buying you time to get on the scoreboard, the landlord who be giving out for free
I’ll be back in a minute, the subject at hand is success, and its soon to be
Why these new rappers is taking notes
I’m the highest of class, make room for me
I’ll disappear when you feel I’m most needed  (yes I do)
I need to just study my art
Cause when I return I’ll faces legions in need of defeat
And staff oceans in need of a part
Master the elements
Rigid in regiment
Heir to throne like it’s Nanda Parbart
I’m not lying I’m bout to be a king killer
But I ain't a mark, so they won’t leave a
