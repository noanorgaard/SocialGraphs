A dinner party and it went all night
And we went through a dozen bottles of wine
And everybody, they was havin a real
A real good time
Yeah so dinner it was over, up out of my seat
Turn up the music and speed up the beat
Gotta find a girl
To dance with me
So everybody movin' grooving' into that kitchen
5-4-3-2-1 ignition, that girlie caught my eye
It was time to move into position
She had...
Dark hair and a green tank top
With tight blue jeans and sandy flip flops
She was sweeter than sweet, she was sweeter than the
Sweetest lollipop. And I said...
Ooh girl, yeah ooh ooh girl won't you be mine
I got to know
So that I can do
Do you right yeah, do you right yeah
