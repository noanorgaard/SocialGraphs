Disarmed me by truth and broke my mold

Always, I'll remember you

Time to take down your barricades
And follow your own path now

Always, I remember you
Slow down, and try to tell the truth
Always, I can recall you
Can you slow down so I can follow you?

In the jungle of your heart

Where is your life
