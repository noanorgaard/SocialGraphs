Nigga, shit don't stop
(Don't think I'ma ever change
Getting money over everything)
Shit don't stop, bitch
(Gotta get it how I live nigga
I been bangin' since a lil' nigga)
Nigga, shit don't stop
(Get the cash, then we gone
Hope we make it back home)
Shit don't stop, bitch
(Can't lose, gotta keep grindin'
Never cry, be a G about it)

LA get crazy, gotta stay ready
Shoot-outs at the beach, hold that K steady
Free my nigga Seany Pooh from the south
They sent my nigga in round the time I got out
Why these niggas don't like me 'cause I'm young and I'm comin' up
Pretend you don't see a homeboy, you really fuckin' up
And I be cuttin' up
I'm a nigga in the street, get this cash and keep it way G
Young king doing me with my fucked up teeth
Late night shoot-outs in my red grand prix
Niggas remind me of Jane Brady, stop hatin'
Y'all grown men actin' like ladies, they bangin' like the '80s
Muthafuckas gettin' chipped
Walk up, spray, hit the gas and then dip
Shit back wild, everybody dumb high
Can't stop now 'cause this shit don't stop

Nigga, shit don't stop
(Don't think I'ma ever change
Getting money over everything)
Shit don't stop, bitch
(Gotta get it how I live nigga
I been bangin' since a lil' nigga)
Nigga, shit don't stop
(Get the cash, then we gone
Hope we make it back home)
Shit don't stop, bitch
(Can't lose, gotta keep grindin'
Never cry, be a G about
