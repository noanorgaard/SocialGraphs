Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
Fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live

I'm thirty-three for a moment
I'm still the man, but you see, I'm a they
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind
I'm forty-five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm headin' into a crisis
Chasin' the years of my life

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself within a mornin' star
Fifteen, I'm all right with you

Half time goes by, suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye, sixty-seven is gone
The sun is getting high, we're moving on...

I'm ninety-nine for a moment
And dyin' for just another moment
And I'm just dreamin'
Countin' the ways to where you are

Fifteen, there's still time for you

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Diggin' for kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Lookin' for special things inside of me

Inside of me
Inside of me
Yeah, inside of me
Inside of me
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man lookin' for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy, hoo, hoo, hoo
It's not easy to be
