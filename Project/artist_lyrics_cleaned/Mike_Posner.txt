You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh

Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that

Now don't you dare act like you don't know (Don't know)
Know what's up (Know what's up), 'cause your nose is up
I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior (Dior)
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup
'Cause it sure seems you got no doubts
But we all see you got your head in the clouds

I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with oldtimers 'cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
No, you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin', stuck up on that stage singin'
