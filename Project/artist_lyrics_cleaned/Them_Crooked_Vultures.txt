Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
Said you've got me confused, oh

I ain't a better man

No slack, Cadillac, couldn't quit
Gums flap, so here's your teeth back
Accept what I left
Far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
Tailgate by the lake
Too much, too young, every button gonna come undone
Tightrope, no joke
Nothing left, so you go baroque

Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Said you got me confused with a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
I know you've got me confused

Yeah


Look out, what I've done
New fang pressing down low
No more waiting around for
New fang pressing down, ah
No more waiting around, oh
New fang, new fang
They ain't gonna wait, no
New fang, new, oh
Ain't gonna wait no 

It don't matter, don't try to explain
You're just another dog to be trained
Choke-chained
You're gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail


Brother does not dream anymore
Sisters could not sleep
Transformation incomplete, mercy killing those counting sheep
I'm the trigger, quick to fire, punctuate betwixt the eyes
You're clever, it ain't gonna help you

Violence is just an incomplete thought
Coming to a complete stop
Stop
You're so clever, you'll tear us apart
Then masquerade it as art
Not smart
If you can help anyone, help yourself
That's unless you hate yourself
Then don't help

Angry ants are crawlin'
Makes you wanna scream

Lions clawing
Building up steam
Flesh and bone has no persuasion, this is the pathway to my destination
Gunman, where you been?
You're my hero, savior, psycho, slayer

Follow the leader, you lead 'em the same
Slugs punctuate the refrain
Come again?
It don't matter, don't try to explain
You're just a dog to be trained
Choke-chained
You're gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail
I wanna go blind, wanna stare at the sun


You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Shall I lead you to my parlor?
Poison offers disguised in just your size

You won't make it out
You won't make it out


You may think me altruistic
Feel my dark hypnosis closing in

You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Then you grow cold, cold, as a stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close, to ensnare
When I control, you will despair

You won't make it out
You won't make it out


Sycophancy, solipsistic
Spider plays the fool to lure the fly

You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Then you grow cold, cold, as a stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close, to ensnare
When I control, you will
