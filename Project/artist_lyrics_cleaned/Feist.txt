Dirt and grass
The shadow hall
The Moon sails past
Blood as ice is an empty crisis
Lonely and last

Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life

Roots and lines
Roots and lines
Our family tree is a home
From there we climb
The golden hill
Call and they will
Eternally

I held your hand
The giant wand
Alto low song
And history
Begins to be
Blue and brown eyed

Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life


Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to life
Whoa, oh, oh
Bring 'em all back to 

I went up to the window
Lightning banging on the cymbals
I ripped into the night
Came storm into your eyes
My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost his innate calm
It's true enough we're not at peace
But peace is never what it seems
Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm gone
While we look for where it went
It's only echoes in the valley of love

Woah, woah, woah-oh
Woah, woah, woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?

We waste time on blame and weak revenge
Waste energy on projections
We're living proof we've gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo
We carry on as if the time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the way is out
To cut the heart out of the doubt now
The room's full but hearts are empty
Like the letters never sent me
Your words are like a lasso
But you're an instrumental tune


Woah, woah, woah-oh
Woah, woah, woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
Woah, woah, woah-oh
Woah, woah, woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
Woah, woah, woah-oh
Woah, woah, woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
Woah, woah, woah-oh
Woah, woah, woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone
