We used to be so strong
Back then we was right, now we so wrong
She was Beyoncé, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
What I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, 'cause my shortie just cheated
And shortie conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no HIV
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake ID
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely, so

Everyday oughta be a bad day for you (Yeah, uh)
Everyday oughta be a bad day for you (That's right)
You might also like
I guess you can't remember all the times that I was there
Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You were happy on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope, I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope, I hope you go blind
'Cause you look me in my face and you laugh when I cry

Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Oh, I hope you get locked out)

'Cause every day oughta be a bad day for you
Every day oughta be a bad day for you (Yeah, uh)

She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Happiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded, boom
I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
'Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day
Every day oughta be a bad day for you
(Xaphoon you crazy and so am I)
Every day oughta be a bad day for you
Every day oughta be a bad day for you
Every day oughta be a bad day for

Yeah, hey yo, I'm feelin' like Ray Charles
I got my shades on, I don't know where they are
You couldn't find me even if you had a radar
And I spit rapidly AK, AR
I make the music with the soul of a blind man
They be amazed how I get them ladies that cry, "yeah"
And they try to do it, but they're blind to the fact
That they're just stuck in a trap and stayin' right where they at
But I'm Ray Charles, Miss A calls
Talkin' to my dime and I miss 8 calls
And I spit tough, bet you I'ma last Great Wall
I'm goin' ape y'all, I'm the new Ray Charles

I don't need no walking stick, my shit cost a grip
I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it
And if the blunt go out, you better reheat it

Lookin' so fly, feelin' so gone

Ooh boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waitin' all night
Ooh boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice

Yeah, and I think I'm preheated, oven
They hear me spit, they think they know me like their cousin
But it's okay, we at the door that means we're buzzin'
Now that's McDonald's and baby I think I'm lovin', it
But you know that size doesn't fit
MC Hammer with this shit, like why the fuck would I quit?
Let's hire 40 people and get like 40 cars
And I wouldn't even drive cause I would be Ray Charles
See us and say, "What up?" like, how the fuck is he talkin'?
He don't even trip, like how the fuck is he walkin'?
I'm blind, man, yeah, like the Three Blind Mice
And them haters, I'ma throw it on 'em
Tell 'em I don't need no walkin' stick, my shit cost a grip
I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it

Ayo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream
Mo' money, mo' problems, when I get it, I'ma pile it up
Now I'm dope, Wonder Bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ayo, I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and them fans going wild with us
Tell Mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party

Remember you was a kid, reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, google me the images
Follow me, follow me, I'm the leader
And when I park cars, I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger, as a kid it was the best
I used to touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak, yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle, I need Chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band, show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how y'all feel
I got the flow to make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good "Just puff it and relax, bro"
And you can get it free, don't worry about the tax though
And Xaphoon, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Burgundy, I anchor on the track like that

Can I please get a little bit of knowledge?
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
'Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama, so you are Svetlana
And I'm just a rhymer, swimming in the water
Tryna dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at, pretty lady? Show me what you got
They say, "Why you rapping for the kids for?"
I say, "My clothes come fitted, the Lids store"
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
And let me get wit' ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Voletta has; big picture
The rule is, the dude is
So up, so Chuck, I'm a cool kid
