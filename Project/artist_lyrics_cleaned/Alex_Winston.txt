I don't mean to be so crass about the situation
But it's easier than breaking down
The reasoning your loose interpretation
In a sea of motherfuckers, man, you were no salvation

Why'd you go leave me to the vultures?
Now it weighs so heavy on my soul
Why'd go leave me to the vultures?
It got so heavy

And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better
And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better

My god, it's so perverted
To call yourself a legend
Cause I never met a hero
Who would leave you in the trenches
I don't mean to be so crass about the situation
But it's easier than breaking down
The reasoning your loose interpretation
In a sea of motherfuckers, man, you were no salvation

Why'd you go leave me to the vultures?
Now it weighs so heavy on my soul
Why'd go leave me to the vultures?
It got so heavy

And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better
And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better

Now I can't sleep at night
I'm not afraid, I'm terrified
And I can't sleep at night
I want to, I want to
And I can't sleep at night
I'm not afraid, I'm terrified
And I can't sleep at night
I want to, I need to know
Why'd you go leave me to the vultures?
Now it weighs so heavy on my soul
Why'd go leave me to the vultures?
It got so heavy

And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better
And oh, oh, oh
We could've done better
We should've done better

Now I can't sleep at night
I'm not afraid, I'm terrified
And I can't sleep at night
I want to, I want to
And I can't sleep at night
I'm not afraid, I'm terrified
And I can't sleep at night
I want to, I need to
