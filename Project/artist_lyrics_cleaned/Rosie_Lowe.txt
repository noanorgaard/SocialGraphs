I remember all the good things
I forgot them all

And I am a fraud
For letting go

I thought I made the right choice

I thought I made the right choice
Then you came
In spite of me
We’re what remains
And you are beautiful
Thought I made the right choice
Then you came
Am I to blame?
Did I lose this game?
You are beautiful

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
I thought I made the right choice
Then you came
In spite of me
We’re what remains
And you are beautiful
Thought I made the right choice
Then you came
Am I to blame?
Did I lose this game?
You are beautiful

I thought I made the right choice
Then you came
Am I to blame?
Did I lose this game?
You are beautiful
You are
