Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife

Turn down the voice inside my head
'Cause heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
But I will climb out, find another view
Now I've found you

Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)

(Ultralife with me)
Found me on a basement floor (Ultralife with me)
Back when I had lost it all (Ultralife with me)
Told me what the fight was for (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up no more (Ultralife with me)
You elevate the life in me (Ultralife with me)
Illuminate the in-between (Ultralife with me)
Forever gonna feel this free (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up now
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
But now I've found you

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun

Oh, we're living ultralife

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat

Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5 a.m. light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat (Falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (We're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (Found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream (We're moving), in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream (We're moving), in a technicolour beat

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it

Your name I'll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?

And don't you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?

But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

'Cause lovin' you, lovin' you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Lovin' you, lovin' you
I cannot be lovin' you, lovin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Lovin' you, lovin' you
I cannot be lovin' you, lovin' you

Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there's a place I'd rather be

I can't forget about the way you played me

Oh, won't you be my live wire?
Make me feel like I'm set on fire
Your love will take me higher and higher
Oh, won't you be my live wire, my live wire?

I've been pretending all my shots are blown
Cover my heart up, never let it show
I'm shaking it off to find a higher low
So heavy the water, oh, so heavy the water falling

Down, down, deep down
Down, deep down
Down, down, deep down
Can you hear me falling?
Down, down, deep down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Before I was found, I felt like I could drain the ocean
Before I was found, I didn't wanna breathe out
Now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder
A love with no doubt, and now I'm never gonna slow down
Never gonna slow down

Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
