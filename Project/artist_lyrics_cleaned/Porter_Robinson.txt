Who survived? Somebody new?
Anyone else but you?
On a lonely night was a blinding light
A hundred leaders would be borne of you

And though I know, since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend on you
And though I know, since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone, and never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend
I'll depend on you

I don't know much about your life beyond these walls
The fleeting sense of love within these Godforsaken halls
And I can hear it in his voice, in every call
This girl who's slept a hundred years has something after all
