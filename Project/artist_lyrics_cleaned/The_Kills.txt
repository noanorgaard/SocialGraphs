Put your hands up and do your dipsy and dropsy
And line up, we're hanging up
Double sixing it, night after night

Listen up, it's picking up
Put your hands up and do your kicksy and lipsy
Your times up, we're hanging up
Double sixing it, night cause tonight
We're doing it to death (oh, oh....)
Doing it to death (oh, oh....)
