I'm not leaving
Not now that you're here with me
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up
I may be dreaming
But what I felt for you is real
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up

Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
You might also like
Turn the lights off
In this bedroom
For tonight, I will be dreaming of you
It's the one thing
I can rely on
When everything else is so confused

I'm not leaving
Not now that you're here with me
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up
I may be dreaming
But what I felt for you is real
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up, don't wake me up

Turn the lights off
In this courtroom
While the jury decides what to do with me
I was stupid
A little crazy
Is this what love is supposed to be?

Don't wake me
