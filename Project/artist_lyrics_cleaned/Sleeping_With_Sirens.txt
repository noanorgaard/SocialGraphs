Tell me how has it taken so long for me to open up my eyes?
As I feel you now, I won't fall for the things you've said before
How has it taken so long for me to finally realize?
I'm in my team, they won't run away, but back to-to believe
And when they all turn against you, you better be prepared to fight

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows
You only do what you're told
You better hope that you're right
They say I'm a sinner, I'm not the only one
You want to point your finger?
You better make a choice tonight
'Cause I'll stand up for what is right

How has such a bitter person become the man I am?
I'm tearing my heart out, just give me the time

How to save my life, so save me, so save me (How to be saved?)
