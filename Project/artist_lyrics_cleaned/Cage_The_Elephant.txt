I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical, moonlit night
Because nobody's talking 'bout you

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world

To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world

Am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl?
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sun-swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world

Will we burn on or just smolder?

Rolling around like a big rubber ball
Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand

All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll see
And then they'll see

Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Covered my tracks, thought I was fine
Got no self control, now I'm back here in line

Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydreams
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right

Oh, why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been trippin' over you, so tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Maybe I should pack my things and move on
Maybe I'm foolin' myself and you're already gone
Watchin' the flames wither and fade
Tryin' to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down on my knees, just prayin' that I can hold on

I don't think you understand

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord

Let me go, let me be

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post
