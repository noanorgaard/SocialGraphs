Tell it, girl

But Zeus and Hera wept
Because their son could never come home
They'd have to watch their precious baby grow up from afar
Though Hades horrid plan
Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth
The boy grew stronger every day
And that's the gospel truth

The gospel truthYou might also 

We are the muses
Goddesses of the arts
And proclaimers of heroes

Heroes like Hercules

Honey you mean Hunk-ules!
Woohoo, I'd like to make some sweet music—

Our story actually begins long before Hercules
Many eons ago
(sung)
Back when the world was new
The planet Earth was down on its luck
And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok

It was a nasty place!
There was a mess wherever you stepped
You might also like
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept

Woo! Say it, girlfriend!

And then along came Zeus

He hurled his thunderbolt

He zapped

Locked those suckers in a vault

They're trapped
And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks
And that's the gospel truth
The guy was too type A to just relax

And that's the world's first dish
Yeah, baby

Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth

Though, honey, it may seem imposs'ble
That's the gospel truth
On Mount Olympus, life was neat
And smooth as sweet vermouth
Although, honey, it may seem imposs'ble
That's the gospel
