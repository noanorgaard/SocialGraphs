I want an alien for Christmas
Bring me an alien this year
I want a little green guy
About three feet high
With seventeen eyes
Who knows how to fly
I want an alien for Christmas this year

He can live in the bathtub
So don't worry about a thing
And I'll take him out for walks
When it gets nicer in the spring
I'll always keep him company
He'll never be alone
And we can hang around the house all day
And watch The Twilight Zone

And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there" (Spot over there)
