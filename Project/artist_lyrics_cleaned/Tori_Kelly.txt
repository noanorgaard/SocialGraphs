If I could be a pilot, I would
Unlock the sky, see what's inside it, I would
Cause everyone's out doing things and I'm stuck in my room
But if this bed grew some wings, then what could I not do?
Just me and my fickle heart
Lonely never felt so right
I would go anywhere tonight
Oooooh
Oooooh

If I could build a rocket, I would
I would go anywhere tonight
I would go anywhere tonight (mmhhmm)
I would go anywhere...You might also 

Thinkin' it could be different, maybe we missed it
Thinkin' it could be different
It could, it could

It should've been us
Should‘be been a fire, should've been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Could've been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure
We were crazy, but amazing
Baby, we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us

Back and forth like a tug of war
What's it all for? Do I want it back?
Still got a little flame for ya
Even though you drove me mad
Now and then, I pretend
That it's you when I close my eyes
You got yours, I got mine
But I wonder where you are tonight

Please don't scar this young heart
Just take my hand

I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

Hold me close through the night
Don't let me go, we'll be alright
Touch my soul and hold it tight
I've been waiting all my life

I won't scar your young heart
Just take my hand

I’ll dive in the sky, oh the water’s alive
I’ll float down to soak in the stars
Swim away from the night, I am swallowed by light
Suddenly love doesn’t seem very far

Here in this castle that sits on a cloud
Something consumes this heart, rooted deep down
Now slowly I’m falling
But I don’t need saving
You’ve already got me
You’ve already got me
This celestial glow is blinding

I’ll dive in the sky, oh the water’s alive
I’ll float down to soak in the stars
Swim away from the night, I’m swallowed by light
Suddenly love doesn’t seem very far
Take me there, take me thereYou might also
