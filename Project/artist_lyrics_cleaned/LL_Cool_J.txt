It's our first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off, make sure your G spot's soft
I'ma call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact, I can't wait for your candy rain
So what you sayin'? I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn, the kitty cat's tight
Mmm, daddy, slow down your flow
Put it on me like a G, baby, nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga, Mandingo in the sack
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin' about
Mmm, but do you really think that you can work it out?
I guarantee, shorty, it's real, baby, stick it out
Here comes the man of steel

Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down, damn, I love a dick down
You use a rubber? Damn right
You are my lover, all night
The putty good to you? Word to momma
Mad tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
Word, we ain't goin' out like that
All this time, you been tellin' me that you was a Don
I tried to warn you, girl, you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
Mmm, you make me wild, don't do that
Chill, wait a minute, baby, let me please you back
You talk a good one, shorty, now you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it, girl? Nice and wet
We get it on To The Break of Dawn, damn, you're large
How a big girl like it, Daddy? Nice and hard
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' mad affectionate
Chewin' it, oohin' it, all while we're doin' it

Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot, schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop, damn, I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce, sugar,  long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest, roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy, put my body to the test
Wait, wait, daddy, many niggas ago
I was a young girl listenin' to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off, daddy, I'm grown
From the back, from the side, right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit, Press rewind
Let it flow on screen while we puffs a "L"
Layin' back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown, we'll be
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well (Check it out)
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well (Uh)
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well (Def Jam)

Going back to Cali, stylin', profilin'
Growlin', and smilin', while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, 'cause it's sittin' on Daytons
Nardi steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
VRRRROOM engine's blowin', the chrome, is shinin'
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hey y'all, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, shakin' 'em, bakin' 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
I know a place, off Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, but the girls still strip
The record skipped, but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin,' romancin'
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus, but I don't wanna pay

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... man, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali

I'm going back to Cali, risin', surprisin'
Advisin' realizin', she's sizin' me up
Her bikini - small; heels - tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, "Close your eyes, I got a surprise"
And I ran away with the bottle of wine

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

C'mon, man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word (But tonight—)

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold

I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

Knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
