If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
But now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old-time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
Exhumin' things that's better left alone
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms, I feel the passions I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

But on the other hand, there's a golden band

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, "Can't you see the Promised Land?"
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me"

Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know

Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you, I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
