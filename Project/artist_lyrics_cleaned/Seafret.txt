We are bound to each other's hearts
Caught, torn and pulled apart
This love is like wildfire
And to my word now I'll be true
I can't stop this breaking loose
This love, is like wildfire
Like wildfire
Like wildfire

And to my word now I'll be true
I can't stop this breaking loose
This love, is like wildfire
Like wildfire
Like wildfire

Between you and me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And I want you
And I want you
And I always will
Feels like there's oceans
Between you and
