Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride?

You can see the mornin', but I can see the light
Try, try, try, let it ride
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

Seems my life is not complete, I never see you smile
Try, try, try, let it ride
Baby you want the forgivin' kind, and that's just not my style
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?

I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Mmm, ooh, ooh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
"Nothin' yet, you ain't been around"
That's what she told me

And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure

And he told me of a cure
