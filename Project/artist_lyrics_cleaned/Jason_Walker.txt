So kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand and strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing, swing upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hands and strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling, yeah, yeah
So kiss me
You might also like
So kiss me, yeah

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand and strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling
Oh, kiss me, oh, beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand and strike up the band
And make the fireflies dance, silver moon's sparkling, yeah
So kiss me

So kiss
