Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell yo brother, yo sister
And yo momma too
'Cause we're about to throw down
And you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on baby, tell me, what's the word?

Oh, word up!
Everybody say when you hear their call
You've got to get it underway
Word up! It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You'll know that you'll be heard
You might also like
Now all you sucker DJs
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize
That you're acting like fools
Give us music, we can use it
We need to dance
We don't have the time
For psychological romance
No romance, no romance
No romance for me, mama
Come on baby, tell me what's the word

Oh, word up!
Everybody say when you hear their call
You've got to get it underway

Dial "L" for low...
Come on, all you people say...
W-O-R-D up - W-O-R-D up
W-O-R-D up - W-O-R-D up
W-O-R-D UP
W-O-R-D up (hey)
Hey (hey you) hey, hey (what)

La, la, la, la, la, la, low (low)

Say it like that, (like that)
Say it like that, ya'll know it (woah)
What's the word? (What's (Woah!) the word?)
Everybody's got to know-ow (woah yeah)
Everybody say it, woah!
Low
They think real low (Oww!)
As low as you go (whew)
Ahhhh, low, low, low, low
As low as you go, 

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you
There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you (Oh)

This stuff is starting now (This stuff is starting now)
This stuff is starting now (Oh)
This stuff is starting now (Hoo)

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Yes, I do
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy)
I attempt to look my best for you
Indeed, I do (Just for you)

'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
(For the things that you do)
It's like candy (Candy), oh

You're taking my appetite, but it's all right

It's like candy (Candy)

Look real nice (Real nice), wrapped up tight
You're so dandy (Dandy)
(Would you mind if I had a little bit more of your time?)
Giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like (Oh)

It's like candy (Candy)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
What you do (What you do)

You're like a brand new feeling (Feeling)
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day
You're so dandy (Dandy)
And wrapped up tight
So good, so good (Yeah)
Strawberry (Strawberry), raspberry (Raspberry)
All those good things
Violets and gumdrops
