I’m sorry I named the album Montevallo
And I’m sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I’m sorry you can’t listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
You got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me
Remember the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me
Said, "That'll be you up there one day, just wait and see"
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
So I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the tub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
But since you been gone
Singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind that you can't fall out of

Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
I know this whole thing might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
I don't know what I'm gon' say to you
But I know there ain't no way we're through
And I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through
I'm on my way to you, on my way to 

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again? (Woo-hoo)
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
But we can leave the night on (Yeah, yeah)

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again?
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane

We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind (Woo-hoo)
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on 

And I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines

I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with "Hello"
The next thing you know you try to be nice
And some guys gettin' too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys that talk too much
And wanna stay too long
It's the same old song
And dance, but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes, told me to go to hell
Could've walked away, but you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on, let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
Woah
I don't wanna go home with you
Woah
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom (Freedom)
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me (You love me)
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you "Baby"
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

Ooh, ooh, 

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't goin' out like that

Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishin' you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialin' my number, listening to my favorite bands
I'll say, "Hey baby, you know you can stay, just come and get me"
I'm gonna make you miss me (Miss me)
I'm gonna make you miss me
Woah, oh-oh-oh

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck
5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the four-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

Mama's prayers and Daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

Mm, yeah
When that sun starts sinking
When they turn those open signs around
We thought we ran this town
Running around just
Breaking hearts and curfew
Out in the yard with no shoes
Staying cool in a Nylon pool
Foul ball headed for the parking lot
And those Saturday mornings we sleep late
ATVs and fire breaks
Worn out jeans, Black Eyed Peas, backroads and blue skies
I was born and raised on it
Might have misbehaved on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it 

Summer comin' through a rolled down window
Tearin' down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young, never gonna get old
Livin' for the day like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Stayin' on the gas like we're never coming back

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back beatin'
Buncha rock stars on the riverbanks singin'
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, everything (Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah)
Everything we wanna be (Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh)
We are, we are, we are tonight

Swingin' back and forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still and I don't wanna lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
We're flyin' so high like we're never gonna crash

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl

Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dreamin' as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

And it's hittin' a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms, right down the road
