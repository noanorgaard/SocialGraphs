In the End, the end
Things will never go our way
In the end, the end
Things will never go

So take it in don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I've found
We can't get higher than we get
On the Long Way Down
On the Long Way Down
On the Long Way Down

Burnin' mud in my eyes
Blinding me from the truth
If there's a shadow in me
The dark is a tidal wave inside of you
Take a shot at communion
Gettin' drunk on your antidote
I'll save you the seat next to me
Down below

In the end, the end
Everyone will go away
In the end, the end
Everything will go

So take it in don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I've found
We can't get higher than we get
On the Long Way Down
On the Long Way Down
On the Long Way Down

Down, Down, Down, Down
On the long way down
On the long way down
Down, down, down, down

So take it in don't hold your breath
The bottom's all I've found
We can't get higher than we get
On the Long Way 

I stumble out of my home
I'm looking out every now and then
If I'm leaving my home
I don't know when I'll be back again

So don’t you wait up for me, I'm leaving with the light
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
Trying to pull ahead, I'm always chasing time
Don’t wait up for me, I've got a restless mind
I've got a restless mind

Waiting for the phone to ring and shake me up again
Pull me out from underneath the state that I've been in
Searching for a reason, I've been looking for the door
Nothings gonna keep me here just waiting anymore

I stumble out of my home
I'm looking out every now and then
If I'm leaving my home
I don't know when I'll be back again
