1 ContributorThe Burden LyricsI sat down by the solitary river
In the shadow of a weeping willow tree
It seems like you have changed in the past week
Do you still love me
We've been together so long that I wonder
And my mind is being fuelled by disbelief
Ive gotta hear you say it straight to me
That you still love me
I need your loving words more often
Longing makes the heart go soft
I'm worried that you might be lost
I need to feel the love you give me
And the warmth your body brings me
Need to see it in your eyes
That you still love me
Do you still love me
Time can be a difficult opponent
Things can always change and make us weak
And as I sit alone I nearly weep
Do you still love me
Jealousy is such a heavy burden
Sneaks into my soul and never sleeps
I've gotta hear you whisper it to me
That you still love me
You might also likeI need your loving words more often
Longing makes the heart go soft
I'm worried that you might be lost
I need to feel the love you give me
And the warmth your body brings me
Need to see it in your eyes
That you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love
