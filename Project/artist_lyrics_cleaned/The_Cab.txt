Tell me, what's the point of doing this every night?
What you're giving me is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby, make up your mind

Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

We were on fire, now we're frozen
There's no desire, nothing spoken
You're just playing, I keep waiting
For your heart (I keep waiting for you)
I am fiending for the sunshine
To show our love in a good light
Give me reason, I am pleading to the stars, tell me
You might also like
Tell me, what's the point of doing this every night?
What you're giving me is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh
This is the last time
Baby, make up your mind

'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss

I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na)
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na)
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby, why're you calling me? (Na-na, na-na)
Not another one night, trying to be your whole life
I don't want to fall asleep
I'm your one and only, only when you're lonely
Baby, why're you calling me? (Na-na, na-na)
Not another one night, trying to be your whole life
Oh-oh
'Cause I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something, please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss
Just temporary bliss
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Temporary bliss, oh
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

I can't keep sleeping in your bed
If you keep messing with my head
I can't keep feeling love like this
It's not worth temporary
