The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it’s quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself, have pity
You might also like
Philip, you would like it uptown
It’s quiet uptown

He is working through the unimaginable

His hair has gone grey. He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

You knock me out, I fall apart

Can you imagine?

Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out. That would be enough
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He’d be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges we’re facing
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
And you need time
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity

Eliza, do you like it uptown? It’s quiet uptown

He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

Look around, look around, Eliza

They are trying to do the unimaginable

There are moments that the words don’t reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza’s side
She takes his hand
It’s quiet uptown

Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity
They are going through the

Who is always by your side

To your union
(To the union!)
(To the revolution!)
And the hope that you provide

Rewind, rewind

Helpless, sky's, sky's, helpless
Drownin', drownin'

Rewind
I remember that night, I just might

Rewind

I remember that night, I just might

Rewind
I remember that night, I remember that—
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Trippin' over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander
I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame

This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself
You're like me, I'm never satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied

My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where's your fam'ly from?

Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait

So, so, so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level, what the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement
It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'ma give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He's penniless, he's flyin' by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize

Three fundamental truths at the exact same time
Where are you taking me?

I'm about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Number one

I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons, so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest
And the gossip in New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you

Schuyler?

My sister

Number two

He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naive to set that aside, maybe that is why
I introduce him to Eliza, now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I'll leave you to it

Number three

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"

She'd be lying

But when I fantasize at night, it's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize
What might have been if I hadn't sized
Him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

You searchin' for an urchin who can give you ideals?
