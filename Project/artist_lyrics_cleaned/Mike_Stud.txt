You always call me when you're drunk
Playing all your friends my songs

To see what all that talk is about
Talk is about right now
So come on, make your move right now

Talk is about right now

GPS girl tell me where you wanna go
Yea you can hit the J if you wanna smoke
Yea we can get high keep it on the low
She float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Louboutin heels but she quick on her feet
You can't tell shit but she listens to me
It's different with me
Barely 21 but she a savage
Takes my lyrics and makes a caption
She don't pay for shit but she pays her taxes
She likes Fall Out Boy and Weezer
Late night stops with pizza
Please no grease up on my t-shirt

I used to dream about this kinda life
Way back when I could sleep at night
I'm talking way back, way before I came back
Way before my boy was rockin' that jays hat
Yeah
Now we done made it this far we used to ride the Acela
Bought a crib for the homies and we got wine in the cellar
Call me Chelsea the way I handle it
I took a chance and I took advantage
I brought my brethren for each and every second
And we gon' give em hell until we get up to heaven
So this is for all the ones that I bring along
I'd rather be broke than be rich alone, yeah

I got all my friends feeling more like blood
Pour the liquor till we drown
Livin' all these nights like it's all we got
Come to far to go home now
No matter what we gon' find a way
Swing from the pendulum till it break
And the white flag up no we're never down for the count
And we'll do it till the lights black out
Do it till the lights black out

Yeah
I done came a long way
Long way from home
Long days longer nights long way to go
Broad day I drive the wrong way down the road
Cause if I don't got a lane, then I gotta make my own
Try to be careful of who you keep around
If they don't know your roots gotta weed them out
That make sense don't it?
I count on all my people like the census
That's the general consensus
Yeah shits moving fast but I like this speed
This don't feel like real life to me
And when it gets dark then I light this weed
My friends like my fam and they right with me
I got all my friends feeling more like blood
Pour the liquor till we drown
Livin' all these nights like it's all we got
Come to far to go home now
No matter what we gon' find a way
Swing from the pendulum till it break
And the white flag up no we're never down for the count
And we'll do it till the lights black out
Do it till the lights black out

She said

You know I'm yours when you're around
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?
Are you still down to stay up with me and party?

Couple drinks in me, couple texts to you
I swear to god this some type of shit I never do
And right now it's pretty obvious you want more
We could put 2 and 2 together girl but what for?
But you could ride with me like we on the Tour De France
Yeah, we could have a ball ain't gotta do it like Lance
So girl let me apologize to you in advance
Cause I'mma fuck you so good I'm about to ruin your plans
And everybody wanna act like they know all about me
I just get a kick out of it like Ronda Rousey
Holly Holm I'm hardly home but I've got time to party
I'm in the driver's seat so baby are you calling shotty?
So drop a pin girl, what's your location?

Hell nah I ain't sleep today but I'mma be okay
Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck about what the teacher say, cause either way
I'mma just do me and she said me too, I said "s'il vous plaît"
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions

Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck

And lately I've been stressing because I just miss my family
They see the smiles but never the pain and all the success they see
Allegedly there's some stereotypes I don't like about my height
Trademark HDMH for life, yeah that's right so I copyright
Prove 'em wrong, prove myself right
Cloudy days, smile so bright, 14 lifts, 7 days, fortnight (yikes)
I can't lie, I been on a mission
To make every single doubter eat their words up in their kitchen
Yeah, my vision is to get it while I'm living
I'll keep winning
Legendary comeback, ACL incision, yeah

I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this shit ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny, eh
How many come ups until it's meant to be, eh
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me
This is me
Ain't nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face, all
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go.... eh
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know.... eh, eh
Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing, at all
Cause one minute she's the one
The next you really never know

I used to dream about showing the world what I dream about
Forget a mic, my whole life I thought it'd be the mound
I guess it's fitting how life threw me the curveball
Pops told me work till you make it, man, then work more
I guess I took that to heart
Cause I've been working harder now than I did at the start
And I won't stop 'till I get to the top
Till I can give all of my fam all the things that they want
But there ain't no doubt, I continue to be the doubted
But that's just motivating, so where would I be without it?
Cause the same people asking why you're doing it
Were asking how you did it
So fuck a critic, stay committed to your vision
They can't see it, it's yours
The top floor looks far when you can't get in the doors
But it's crazy what you can see with your eyes closed
I swear I stay on my grind mode
I know I'm getting closer

My whole life's been a chase, it's a gift and a curse
Was on my way up to the top and slipped into reverse
And the same thing I thought killed me brought out the real me
And that's real, see
You gotta find what you love and let it kill you
Just gotta live with the will like Uncle Phil do
Cause on the real, everybody go through times when the sun don't shine
Don't know when our time will come, but it will come in time
Cause yo, I said it first, ain't no telling where I'm headed
So this is for the people that was with me when I said it
And when I said it, I meant it
I swear I won't forget it
Told my family and my friends that I'm forever indebted

[Closer, closer

I just know we getting closer

You start losing your mind when you're gone all the time and you always on the move
And you try to remind yourself it's gonna be fine
And you hoping that it's true
But I know we're getting closer

And I'll track you and check on you
Bless you, buddy

And before that it was one, and before that it was none
Before that, I record that before class for fun
But boy look at me now

Can't blame her though
‘Cause Mike'll make her scream louder than a megaphone
And when I take her home, I'm a show her the truth

You should see the girls that I'm fucking with
Fuck a bucket list, I got a fuck-it list

Making easy money like scholarships
New whip, blacked out like a college chick
So pump me that liquor a little bit quicker
And make sure that it's strong, come on

Been smoking and sippin'
Tryna fuck around with two bitches
‘Bout to take ya'll home and get this
‘Cause I'm paranoid, I'm trippin'
Been smoking and sippin'
Tryna fuck right now, turnt up right now, let's get this

In my top five, I'm Dylan
And Dylan and Dylan and Dylan
If my girl Gisele then I'm Tom
And now I'm on your TV screen like, "Hi mom"
Got Gerry up on TMZ like, "Hi mom" (Hi mom)
Swear to God I'm not high, mom
Wait, okay, sorry I lied, mom
Man I told my father I'd be goin' farther
'Cause my flows are harder than a throw from Rowengarter
Broke both my arms and now they both are stronger

Are you saying something? I just can't change
But I've been trying to, I know I'm supposed to do
Everything I said I would
Yeah, usually I'm alone, but now I'm on the road
I ought to know which way to go

Driving through the night
Looking for you, I'm looking for you
And it goes up and down, and it goes round and round
Like a roller coaster
Making me feel some type of way
All of these thoughts I can't explain
I'm still doing my best, I'm on my way

Sipping on this Beam, trying to find a balance
I feel lost without it, I'm okay with being famous if it's for my talents
So I had to get lost to find myself
If I was wrong then I meant well
Is it too late to change our mind, do I take our time, I guess time will tell
I'll take you anywhere
Yeah, where you want to go to girl?
Remember what I told you girl
