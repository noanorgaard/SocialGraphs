And it was born in a cloud with silver lining
Uh-huh
But it broke
I mean it hatched on the ground so time flew right by me
And voila

I know you thought your life was gon' be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gon' be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found that you were wrong

See, maybe, there was something wrong
And you weren't telling me, no (Nooooo)
See, see, maybe, the laugh's on me (Joke's on me)
And life was telling me a joke

Well, they say, "If something's yours
And you let it go
If it comes back to you
It was yours all along"
Well, I let you go, along with those lies from you
I wonder what else lies in you
Or did the lies just eat it gone

I know you thought your life was gon' be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gon' be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found that you were wrong

See, maybe, there was something wrong
And you weren't telling me, no (Nooooo)
See, see, maybe, the laugh's on me (Joke's on me)
And life was telling me a joke
Babe

Hold it now
Y'all there?
How you feel right now?
Yeah, me, too
Hey, yeah
Oh, babe!
Hold it now

Y'all alright?
See
Do you remember what it's like to wake up in her love nest?
Get it, love nest
And now she's gone, gone, gone, gone
At which point, you realize life is but a joke
And the laugh's on you
It's funny, right?
