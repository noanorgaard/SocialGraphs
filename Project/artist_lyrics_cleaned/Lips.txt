You can fight but you won't always win
Somehow life finds a way to beat ya
But I'll come join you in the ring
Guess it shows just how much I need ya

There are days I would pay anything just to leave it all behind
There are times I can't find any light, get me through the daily grind
I know you feel it too, seen just how long it takes you to unwind
So it would mean everything to me

You can fight, but you won't always win
Somehow life finds a way to beat ya
But I'll come join you in the ring
Guess it shows just how much I need ya
It would mean everything to me if we could take a holiday
Cos you and I bone tired every night isn't my idea of play
And even our smallest dream is getting lean, never sees the light of day
