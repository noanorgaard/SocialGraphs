Yeah we brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback
And kill 'em with the medicine
We brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback
And kill 'em with the medicine
Yeah we brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback
And kill 'em with the medicine
Yeah we brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback

To give 'em a taste
Of their own phony concoction
We coat it in frost
Bringing the head-not lover
For the lonely and lot
In this wasteland
God saved the faceless spaceman
Writing revolution with spray cans
Forging soundscapes to escape
The famine with found objects
Expanding from the sleepiest towns
Down to projects
For better or worse
I put faith in alienation
The one sure source
Of freedom from frustration
Taking my time
I'm sure this is as good as it gets
Setting fire to my vinyl, CDs and cassettes
Killing the video star
With his pretty little car
Beat the rock and roll idol to death
With his guitar, the starving artist
Is heaven in in the cay (?)
Cause I hate the way we're living
But I love it that way
It give me something to say
And that's enough for today
Cause I'm too lazy to leave
But too stubborn to stay
You might also like
A rebel rettering (?)
Knock, knock let him in
Get him to settle in
With the devil's grin
Then kill him with the medicine
I'm better than most
But the level is close
Time for back-pedaling
I tread on my toes
It goes a lil' some-seomthing like this
Pumping my fist
Trying to keep the joint bumping
'Till they jumping and shit
Front and get dissed
By this dummy with bumly kicks
Got no money
But son I leave your tongue in a twist
It's the stoic poet
For those that don't know it
Have to take his last chance at heaven
Going broke by trying to mess around
Hit the skins like Gene Krupa
Stumbling in a drunken stupor
Acting salty like Veruca
Trying to scoop up some truth
Some super duper flow
Platypus spit it hotter than King Koopa yo
Your Bubble Gum Bazooka jokes
Are sucking like a hooka hose
Leave them hanging like they're stupid-o
Mister Cooper show
Gold Complex in the deck
And it'll wreck shop
I get busy like George Michael at rest stops
I'm hot to trot when I rock the spot
Or walk your block
With the knock knock knocking at your door
Like registered sex offenders
It's no use resisting
It's better to just surrender
To your Big Brother blazing trails blindly
Burning bridges behind me
Breaking all the ties that bind me
I'm better than dislexic anorexic songs
I'm that shit like Brita black coffee for breakfast
Hotter than invested (?)
But I'm just getting warm
Putting the money from the music
Into amateur porn
(Panties? I'm not wearing any)

I'm slamming amateur rappers
Who want to damage attack and destroy
This cat making immaculate noise
I'm poised to prey on
MCs faker than rayon
Old school like when I used to write my rhymes in crayon
Stay on to keep it real
Keep it righteous et cetera
I got a back load of rhymes
I'm just trying to keep it regular
High in fiber
With the eye of the tiger
A bald goofy looking dude
Like Matt Geiger (?)
Quit it -g-g-get it
That is if you fit it
Quit it waxing analytical
The minute I spit it
A bit of miscommunication
But isn't it all
Mix alot of love sickness
With a bitter withdrawl
That's word the slurred
Verbs and now you heard the sound
Can't make out the meaning
But you're sure it's profound
I'm politically complex
Cause correct's a matter of context
So save the label for your mix tape
OK dickface?
OK....

Yeah we brought the beat back

We brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback
And kill 'em with the medicine
We brought the beat back
To fertilize the sediment
Forced the feedback
And kill 'em with the medicine
Yeah we kill 'em with the medicine
Kill 'em with the medicine

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah)
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
You might also like
Never without your love


Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me
