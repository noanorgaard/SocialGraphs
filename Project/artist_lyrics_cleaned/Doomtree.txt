When it breaks...
When it breaks, we’ll know it’s time
We’ll know it’s up to us to fix it
When it aches to make its mind, we’ll pick it
'Til then we’ll steer it
Get us near, we’ll swim the distance
Fear after persistence
Kin by cuts, with all decisions lived with
Can’t live without by now
That’s why we shout so loud
Couple down
All respect allowed, the rest could never doubt
Options offered often
Toss 'em to the chop 'em block 'em hostile dodge 'em
Keep watch what I been rockin'
Whole team with a grip got it, no polish

All these rappers sound the same
Beats? Sound the same
Raps? Sound the same
Wings? Fan the flames
Teeth? With the fangs

Now underneath this canopy, crumbling insanity
Bellies rumbling, hungering for the fantasy
Had to see something come from 'em
Had to be crushing savagely
Not your average everyday
Nothing short of a masterpiece
And the tortures of the past are like a fortune for the future
We’ve been fortunate enough to know no borders, no rulers
No schools are out of session, no school’s out of the question
No tools will go unused and no fools will go unmentioned
And there’s a tension in the air we’re breathing
We breathe heavy
We breathe largely
Release the levy
Feel the tension in the air we’re breathing
And breathe heavy
And breathe largely
Release the levy

They hate, they petty
They say we too heady, too heavy, too many, too much punk
Much too drunk, too much luck, love too much - yup
But we earned it all
All work til the curtain calls and our time is up
They ain’t got enough - and it burns 'em up
Before tour and First Ave
It was D 4, T Rock
Toki Wright, Big Chak
Way more than I’ll name drop
But I got y’all when I see y’all
And I’ll keep y’all when the beat stops
I built more than a rap career
I got my family here
But some punks want to jump up
With a sharp tongue and they fronts up
Like we got here by dumb luck
But they just want to become us
But that’s what’s up when you come up
I move like a dump truck
Too long on the road and I earn what I hold
But if you want it, let me know, I can burn your flow like "whoa"
