You're always in between, I go too far
You know I got the anger of a burning sun
Say hold up just a minute, don't burn me now
If you burn me down you'll never find your way
If you burn me down, it's true, a little drop of dreams

And I say
Heatstroke yellow, maybe strawberry blue
The strongest thing I ever felt was feelings for you
So try to look me in the eye
A difficult goodbye
To all the things we hide, ah-oh

I live my life upon a crystal shield
It's unbelievable but I keep believing
I'll never give up 'til the day I die
I'll never give up 'til the day I die, I say
Every single time they come back home from the road
I say, "tell me where you've been to, tell me what you've gone for"
They tell me on the road you end up losing you soul
I'm thinking when they made me they forgot one of those

And I hope you're right cause I don't like this way
And I hope you're right so I can change the future
Cause I was only hiding in the rain, wa-oh

Since I was a young child

You asked me "Are you happy?"
I said "I can't explain"
I told you "I'm a monster" wa-oh

I don't, I don't, I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why but I can see you far away
As you grow and change and I stay the same but

But I, I'm just like you
I've got, got no name at all
The whole world against you
You give everything

Sometimes I think of doing terrible things
I know I shouldn't think it but I do anyway-ay-ay
Maybe I'm just crazy like I got a disease
Feels like I died days ago deep in my sleep
I'm doing terrible things
Give it up, give it up now
T-t-terrible things
Give it up, give it up now

In the sky, in my mind, between my eyes, within my eyes
I don't know why but
Can you feel me melt away?
As the colors seem to fade and save the day but
