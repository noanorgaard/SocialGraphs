Another Sunday mornin', another weekend worth of kickin' it
Now I'm sittin' on the couch and mentally relivin' it
Guess I'll chalk it up, it's just a part of the fast life
A strangers in my room and she look so much better last night
The radio's loud someone turn that shit down
And my livin' room it looks like a fraternity house
Man I swear to God, I regret this shit every Sunday
I'm in dire need of a Tylenol and some Gatorade
My stomach hurts man I know I blew a lot of cash
But I'd be lyin' if I said that I ain't have a blast
The weekends gone I can't believe it again
But I know on Friday I'll be drinkin' again

So let me light a cigarette and drink a beer, it's Sunday mornin'
And if my baby call tell her I ain't here, it's Sunday mornin'
The bar was closin' down again, me and all my rowdy friends
I think the suns comin' up again, it's Sunday mornin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's Sunday mornin' yeah yeah

I lost my rent money I'm about to get evicted
On top of that my fat ass woke up next to a midget
And all that remember was us kickin' it and laughin'
And then I woke up like, what the fuck happened?
I swear, every Sunday mornin' I feel like a bad guy
There's a dude sleepin' on my floor with a black eye
I lost my wallet man I must of left it at the bar
I got my keys but I still can't find my car
So I'm just sittin' here starin' at the ceilin'
Dealin' with such a gut wrenchin' feelin'
The weekends gone I can't believe it again
But I know on Friday I'll be drinkin' again

So let me light a cigarette and drink a beer, it's Sunday mornin'
And if my baby call tell her I ain't here, it's Sunday mornin'
The bar was closin' down again, me and all my rowdy friends
I think the suns comin' up again, it's Sunday mornin'
Yeah, yeah, it's Sunday mornin' yeah yeah

Come on everybody, come on y'all

Let me light a cigarette and drink a beer, (Haha) it's Sunday mornin'
And if my baby call tell her I ain't here, it's Sunday mornin'
The bar was closin' down again, me and all my rowdy friends
I think the suns comin' up again, it's Sunday mornin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's Sunday mornin' yeah yeah
Yeah baby,
