You feel so safe, safe, safe being kept in the dark
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
‘Cause it's that same dark place where you'll get torn apart
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
On your own
On your own
("Hot damn! Tell me that don't feel good!")

It takes so long
You were never one for looking back
A body like a punching bag
You never even stood a chance
You don’t want to know (body like a punching bag)
You don’t want to know (you're never one for looking back)
You never even stood a chance on your own

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together

I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

My inarticulate store-bought hangover hobby kit it talks
And it says "You, oh, you are so cool"
Scissor-shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes

Hoping for the best, just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me (Why can't I feel anything from anyone other than you?)

Yeah, it was all a waste

When you took that ring off
Threw it at your feet
You didn’t say a word
Much less look at me
The courage that that must have took
