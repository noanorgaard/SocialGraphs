Yeah it's hard to know the truth
In this post-modernist view
Where absolutes are seen as relics
And laughed out of the room
And I'm scared to say your name
I've cried wolf so many times, cause I'm afraid of what you'd want from me
And will you find me through the grey?
My mind's a minefield of the wretched
It's honestly deceptive

Yeah, it's over, it's over, I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said "What's up?" and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you, but we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger, last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tilted and I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you
