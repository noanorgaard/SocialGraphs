Ever since that day I asked you into my heart
My world has changed so promise me you'll never part

'Cause I'm lost without you
Easy to see
I'm lost without you
And there's no letting go
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go, go away
Said don't ever go away

You pick me up those times I'm down
You make me laugh when there's no clown
No one else can love me like you do
Heaven knows that I'll proclaim
The love I feel when I hear your name
There's no substitution quite the same
You might also like
Now some say I'm crazy and I'm acting insane
But there's no life without you so I'll stake my claim, oh

I'm lost without you
It's easy to see
I'm lost without you
So I just keep holding on
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go, don't ever go, go away
Na-na-na, go away, hey

Can you tell them about love?
Love is sweet and love is kind
Love will bring you peace of mind
And how do you know?
Well, I'll tell you so
He won't ever go
Oh no, He won't ever

Now, that's what I love about Him
Huh, that's what I love about Him, oh yeah
Hey, 'cause He won't ever go away
No, said He won't ever go away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm lost without His 

They say streets of gold
Can you imagine somewhere
Where life will never end
No one ever grows old (Any older)
Oh, my brother please
Come with me

It's what I live for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I wanna be

There are instructions
That we must follow to a tee
In order to reach there
And there is where I've got to be

No more dying
There is a place where there'll be no more crying
And He is the light
Counting those days when we meet in that place
(Willing to die for)
Ooh, oh, oh

Willing to die for

(Do you wanna go?) (I wanna go)
Willing to die for
It's what I live for
(Say Heaven, say Heaven, say Heaven)
Willing to die 

It's hard to understand sometime
Is there a master plan?
How do I make sense of everything I'm going through
Maybe it's not ours to know
So we have to learn to let things go
And simply try to make the most of every day
And have the faith that somehow we will find the way

So count it all joy, yeah
All that you're going through
(No matter what you're going through)
Even when you're feeling down
Count it all joy, yeah
Each moment's a gift to you
(No matter what you're going through)
So turn it all around
And even in the darkest night
If you look hard enough
There's a trace of sunlight waiting there
Yes, waiting there for you, for you
For you

Been searching everywhere to find
That rainbow in the air
(Rainbow)
Whenever I came close
It just seemed to disappear
I had to change my point of view
Start looking at myself
I can't believe I never knew
Everything that I need was right here
Yes, inside of me

So count it all joy, yeah
All that you're going through
(No matter what you're going through)
Even when you're feeling down

Even in the darkest night
If I look straight ahead
There's a trace of sunlight waiting there
Waiting there
Yes, waiting there for me and you
