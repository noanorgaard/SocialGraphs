1 ContributorBest Friends Forever LyricsTearls you try so hard to hide, you hold it all inside
Pretend it doesn't matter
Why keep it yourself when you got someone else
You know can make it better?
You try to be so strong but I always know when something's wrong
See when you're feeling down
Hey, wasn't it you who's always been there for me?
Don't forget what we've been through together
Hey, isn't it true we promised to always be best friends forever?
Word you don't need to say, the sad that's on your face
Isn't hard to see through
I've been there once or twice, it's you that make things right
My turn to be there for you
You try to be so stong but I always know when something's wrong
See when you're feeling down
Hey, wasn't it you who's always been there for me?
Don't forget what we've been through together
Hey, isn't it true we promised to always be best friends forever?
When the rain come down I'll be there, I will always be around
Just wanna be the one to catch you when you fall

Don't forget what we've been through together
Hey, isn't it true we promised to always be best friends
