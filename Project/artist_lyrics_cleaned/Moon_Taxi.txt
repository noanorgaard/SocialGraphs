No one's an island
Here we stand, hand in hand
Rising up again

But you've got the fight in your eyes
And now we're shining under red hot lights
The truth burns as bright as the sun
We're gonna come back and show everyone

We'll watch the world look back at you
What is it seeing? (what is it seeing?)
But we did what we had to do
To keep believing (to keep believing)

Cause we didn't know back then
No one's an island
Here we stand, hand in hand
Rising up again

So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

Woah-ooh

Sometimes it's hard to tell
What we're really living for
Hear the voices calling out from the streets
Singin' get ready
Get ready for more

Oh, woah running wild
Oh, woah running wild

So drink it in, let it race around your mind
We come alive, as it's dripping from our eyes
Oh this city's wild
Oh its burning through the night
Until we say goodbye
And just for now
We could come undone with the rising sun

Oh, woah running wild

Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know

Crossing the desert when I lost the caravan
I found a compass in a box buried underneath the sand
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I've got
Running in circles I was losing my mind
When you found me and you led me to the water just in time
Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got
