Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
"Aye, aye, aye, aye aye..."

It's your right to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
If you love your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye, oh" (Oh)

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me, do you feel the same? Everybody say..

See the look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready, aye
Come along let's get it
If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me, do you feel the same? Everybody say

Party people say, party people say, "Aye

It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all, oh
Whether I rise or fall, oh
I'm gonna give it my all

Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say

Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say
Celebrate and 

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You might also like
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, 

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah
You might also like
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Oh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, 

What's life like on a train?
Nobody there knows your name
As your decision changed
Do you wish that I came?
I thought you'd pick me up from work
I waited for your truck for half hour
I know you said you were gonna
But I never thought you'd leave

This one thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody, oh

Square face and puppy eyes
Found out they never lied
Your old man lived in the sky
Left your house with a yard
But you went away a different try
Found a place that's your size
Too good to finish life here with me
I couldn't get you to say
Why you wouldn't let me come
What should be simple just ain't
And it shouldn't hurt like it does
You might also like
This one thing is made for us
Won't stay with us, it ain't saving us
But I'll take one thing over everything
I'll take that thing over anybody

Baby, hold me, don't pick me up
I need a compliment
Just a touch from a friend
I need a gentle word
I need your company
I'll keep

One thing that was made for us
Chasing us, saving us
I take one thing over anything
I take that thing over anybody
I take one thing over everything
I take that thing over anybody
Oh, oh, anything
Oh, oh, take one
