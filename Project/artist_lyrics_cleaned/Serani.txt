Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

We've been together six months now (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows (Made me change my ways)
I gave my life over to you (Then you turned around)
After all that we've been through (I was your rebound)

Girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance
You might also like
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

Is this the life you really want (Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very fun (There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your happiness

But, girl, I want you (All time)
I'll forever love you (You're mine)
I'm not mad, even though I'm sad
('Cause you) Should give me one more chance

Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah-ah

'Cause you're my one and only
I'm still here feelin' lonely
Feelin' wasted, yeah-e-yeah, yeah-e-yeah, ah-ah
You're my sunshine, I need you back one more time
Ti-i-ime, time, ah-ah
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah-ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games,
