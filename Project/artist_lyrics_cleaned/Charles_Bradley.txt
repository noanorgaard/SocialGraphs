When I was down and out
I need some company
When I didn't know who to turn to
I was all alone
I need some kind of love
To help me see things through
Baby! I'm lost in your love
You know what I mean? Lost in your love

Make me see who you are

Baby (Baby)
Nobody but you (Baby)
Oh, oh oh (Ooh, baby)
Nobody but you, baby
Nobody

Hold on to my love
I will take you through

Nobody!

Baby (Baby)
Nobody but you, baby (Ooh, baby)
I don't want to be lonely (Ooh, baby)
