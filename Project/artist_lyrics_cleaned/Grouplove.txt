Yeah, we laughin' like a Wednesday night
We ran across the interstate
And drank a bottle of vinegar
And then we stayed up really late

Break it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be

And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for ya'
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dippin'
And I can't understand what I'm after

So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
But green is blue, and so are you
And now we gone to Jupiter (Right now)
To Jupiter (Ah, shit)

The sky is blue, the trees are too
Swim, swim, swim from green to red
Go to bed, ya' sleepyhead
Swim, swim, swim in your swimming pool

Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Living in the back of a boat just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right

And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight clan
Throw your dukes up, "wham!"
We are splashing in the water to the beat

Hot day, mid-June
Naked kids, running wild, and free

You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
The ships and treasures make reef
Just one of those days had a blue, perfect wave
Come out and join, you'll see

We are lying in the sun, when we're done find a towel
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams (uhh)
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh 

Livin' without my shadow, livin' far away
Livin' without my shadow, livin' far away (And I said)

Three times we climbed the stairs that never went nowhere
Tied up in basket and she carried me to February
Three times she marries me, but I was never there
Can't keep the family from changin' me to what I am, yeah, oh

Livin' without my shadow, livin' far away
