Yeah, keep on shining your light
Gonna make everything, pretty mama
Gonna make everything alright
And I ain't got no worries cause I ain't in no hurry at all

Well, if it rains, I don't care!
Don't make no difference to me
Just take that street car that's going up town
Yeah, I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland
And dance the honky tonk
And I'll be buying everybody drinks all round

Don't you feel it growing, day by day?
People getting ready for the new
Some are happy, some are sad
Wo-oh-ah, we gotta let the music play
Mh-hm

What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through
Oh now, mamma don't you ask me why

Woh-ho-ho, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
All the time


Well, I know you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away

Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

Woh-ho-ho, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music
All the time

Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Woh-uh-oh, listen to the music

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
