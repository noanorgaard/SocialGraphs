We're insane, but not alone
You hold on and let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again
Like the sun, we will live to rise, again

What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test?
And if I fail, what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

We're insane, but not alone
You hold on and let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die and then ignite again

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
I'm a searchlight soul, they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking, when I get it right, when I get it right

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

So what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine
So don't you lock up somethin' that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying, no, not tying

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
