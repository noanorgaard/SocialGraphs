If you see me runnin'
Through the streets and callin'
Into love I'm fallin'
Katie, be my darlin'
And if you hear the silence
I hope you find it charmin'
I'll be out in the mornin'

What can I do to make her see?
I would swim the ocean wide
From New Orleans, to Galilee

If you see me runnin'
Through the streets and callin'
Into love I'm fallin'
Katie, be my darlin'
And if you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charmin'
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie, be my darlin'

Through the streets and callin'
Into love I'm fallin'
Katie, be my darlin'
And if you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charmin'
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie, be my darlin'
If you see me runnin'
Through the streets and callin'
Into love I'm fallin'
Katie, be my darlin'
And if you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charmin'
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie, be my darlin'
If you see me runnin'
Through the streets and callin'
Into love I'm fallin'
Katie, be my darlin'
And if you hear the sirens
I hope you find it charmin'
I'll be out in the mornin'
Katie, be my
