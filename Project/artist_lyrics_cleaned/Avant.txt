I stepped in the club in your hood
I slowly turned left, and there you stood
You and your friends talkin', but when our eyes connect, I knew then
It was just like two-ways on beam, I'm your king, be my queen
And what do you wanna do tonight?
My truck is parked out front, so let's ride

I can read your mind, babe (Ohh)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin', babe)
It's alright (With me, baby), it's alright, yes
I can read your mind, babe (I can)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin', baby)
It's alright (With me, yeah, yeah), it's alright, yes

So, baby, take a ride with me, and I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pourin' down, then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control over your body, that's my goal
So, baby, just come down here, just let the gravity pull you near

I can read your mind, babe (I can)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know what you're thinkin')
It's alright (Can you feel me? Yeah), it's alright, yes (Ooh, baby)
I can read your mind, babe (Just me and you right now)
I know what you're thinkin' (I got an idea, babe, yeah)
It's alright (Ohh, yeah), it's alright, yes

I know you wanna rub, I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel, so, baby, keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grindin' slowly
I know you wanna rub, I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel, so, baby, keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grindin' slowly

I can read your mind, babe (I can read it)
I know what you're thinkin' (And I know)
It's alright (You see, I know, that you know, 'cause I can feel it too, babe)
It's alright, yes
I can read your mind, babe (Just me and you, yeah)
I know what you're thinkin' (I know, yeah)
It's alright (Ohh, ohh, yes), it's alright, yes
I wanna love, baby (That's what I wanna do to you)
I wanna feel you (If you come, if you come)
I wanna love, baby (Oh, ohh, oh-oh, yeah)
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you, girl)
I wanna love, baby (Come on and go with me)
(I want you to stay with me)
I wanna feel you ('Cause it's alright with me, listen, baby)
(Come on and go with me)
I wanna love, 

I got your legs spread all over the bed
Hands clenched in the sheets
Hair wild as hell
I know the only thing on your mind is sexin' me
Girl, I can feel your temperature rising
You should feel my nature too
Come on, it's gonna be a bumpy ride
Girl, let's do what we came to do

Girl, when we make love all night

We really make love

On the balcony gripping the rails
Slowly I'm pulling you near
Sayin', "Shhhh, babe, don't make too much noise
There's a lot of people that live around here"
Emotions running high
My hands planted on your thighs
You feel me going up and down
And round and round and round

When we make good love all night

Girl, your driveway in the back seat
Windows tinted, it's getting deep
Fog all over the glass
I don't know how long I can last
With you moaning crazy
Girl, keep on calling me
I'll take you to ecstasy
And when I'm done, you'll be fast asleep
Girl, when we make love all night

The house, the boat, and the jeep, babe
In the tub, in the pool, or the beach, babe (don't matter to me)
Get your grove on (Get your grove on), get your grove on
(If you got a lady, get your groove on)

Every time I see you, girl, I get a bad vibe
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
Just thinking of someone else in between your thighs
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)
That's why I say...

When we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
Oh, but now
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

I don't wanna be with you
Put that on everything I own
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
If I never see you again, I won't be mad at all
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm.) No, no
'Cause I believe that you're my downfall
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)

A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain
Times keep changin', come sun or rain
