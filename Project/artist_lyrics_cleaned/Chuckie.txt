1 ContributorUnderground Choppers - Miz Mash Up Lyrics
The bigga the figga the bigga the gorilla like godzilla
Like a veteran packin a weapon and killin when spittin this ammunition
Listen this sum'bitch I'll get vicious quick wit these lyrics any minute
So give me a second I'll leave you dumb in a instant wit a mouth equipped wit a banana clip on a mission
I'm in it to win to get it
I kill it with the rhythm whole; never wit it minimal
A killa with a million syllables
Leavin a beat critical a lyrical individual over flowin wit a mouthful wit the flow from the mo when i go I own it
Yo
Whenever ya ready to battle me you better be steady wit a melody better watch who the fuck you be challenging I'ma monster
Choppin up 16's like a piece of meat on beats bringin heat cuz Mizury the unholy from Missouri
Kicks it harder than soccer
Hotter then lava, I be the chopper motherfucker with lyrics comin to get it in deeper than ya fuckin daughter
I go harder then a automatic rappin in a fashion blastin on bastards like I be packin and rackin a fully stocked sawed off on any roster
Beats are tellin me there ready when they wanna be buried heavily in a cemetery
So they ain't comin carefully whenever their bringin that rhythmic energy
I'm ready wit a lyrical hammer wit the stamina playin like a cinema
So when I'm on a beat beatin the beat to a inch of its life I'm not givin a fuck
I hit em and they feel it 'cause I'm a killer any minute, so when I get up and finish em, I do it big
And keep it strange; dibkis teeth of a chainsaw painfully makin a verse hurt when this chopper rips

No beat is a hostage i spit toxic; eat 'em alive when choppin i'm labelled cautious when killing
With a million syllables leaving a verse full and critical cause i'm an invincible lyrical criminal super up'd villain
And i be chopping it up wit the rhythm holding the title of a killer gorilla
Born in the wild steppin and wreckin any village; Chopzilla
Go getta in the middle of any season ta deepen the reason of a breathin
Demon beating the weaken; seeking the dream eating the beats to pieces
I'ma bad mother chopper dropping the heat and don’t ever call me a dreamer cause
This nigga dont believe in sleep
When most be day dreamin believin on what they thank, i be grinding and defining how i eat by murdering 16's
And I'm wit a team of some beast teethin lookin for some blood and they call me that mizury and I'ma little bit mizunderstood
And i don't give a damn ill throw a temper tantrum; chucky of the rap game when i put my chucky on
I'm tested with the best ta wreck ta rest that’s left when taken their breath from they chest when the Midwest chants progress
Making you possessed when spitting venom and the rhythm compress like i'm a snake striking my prey looking for who’s next
Well catch a case when the makin the AK mix wit the base so don’t think we can't; we’ll fill a page and define slaughter
I treat beats like enemies when I'm bringin the misery and properly murder a verse like a real underground chopper
Tech N9ne decided we to grimey for the world wide wit our fire so he hired a rap god over real monsters
'Cause when it comes to this quick shit; our tongue spits in tongues bitch 'cause will lyrically paint a picture like an author
I load 'em up when i be unloadin' a clip and demolish shit; my targets ain't hard ta miss when i be equipped wit these lips
I take part in hip-hop anonymous stomping like a hippopotamus being confident shaking and breaking ya beds ta wake you up bitch
You might also like
I'm definining a mad whitey ta get excited like a riot wit the quiet comin uninvited and packin
I'll shotta rapper down wit a full clip of syllable killin action in tragic; shootin the beat up like a insulin reaction bastards
At any instant my tongue be passive wit no blinkers when passin most these bitch ass mainstream rappers
I wilding out harder then what nick cannons about every time my mouth opens spittin cannons at them actors
And pullin weight like a tractor; never lookin backwards; i push go and go after gettin what i want on purpose
I wanted to make an indention wit some rhythm while keepin it real and original so i keep pounding on the undergrounds surface
I'm a fuckin chopper; unlike a lot of the motherfuckers out here just tryin to rap fast
And i be kickin it wit team and we gasin it like matches settin a fire to the mattress under hip-hops ass
I be livin it independent breakin the bread while leavin the mics dead and killin for funds; killin for fun; ill punch a beat in the cunt what!
I get a little mental on the instrumental when my dental hit syllables gettin critical when i starts speakin in fuckin tongues
I'ma little advanced for regular music son wit a elevated level it gettin harder to step my game up
And i be bustin a nut when i bust on a beat givin it all of me; knee fuckin deep in that slut sprayin Miz babies like its nothin when i nut
Choppin it up wit that per fec tion; this profession is killin and my tongue is the weapon
I'm beastin and feastin on these emcees feelin froggy not jumpin at me from they leap pad at home
I'm a under ground chopper from the bootheel motherfucker, I'm Mizury
Kickin wit kings of versatility and delivery in remedies defining real art made it easy

The devil and I'm able to catch fire like a "fire-fighter" being a fire starter when I'm preachin to the choir; a soldier wit a flame thrower
Showin devotion as the rappin chucky wit a temper killin em over being the mad whitey; son of Sam of the Rap game; I'm mister lawmower
Wit a mouth motored by the south killin syllables without count-in em out 'cause the syllables per second I'm addressin is on y'all
I just beat a beats heart beat till it don beat and then I eat it like I mean it like a feinin zombie high as fuck on some bathsalts
I'm balls to the wall; i'ma problem 'cause I'm awesome when I'm droppin these bombs on em without a cause; so fuck y'all, I don't give a damn
The villain in me being a felony on a killin spree in any vicinity wit a crowd and a mic stand just shows i go turkey-ham
Psycho like I'm Michael at thanksgiving gettin savage attackin a track choppin it up like a ninja
Out to get your attention and make you listen to my visions makin you picture em wit the wisdom of this ballistic
Rhythm I've written killin the competition wit the ammunition when spittin
Choppin em up and bustin em down like a demolition derby like im on a mission; special edition, mint condition 'cause their hasn't been a thirsty nigga ta merk me wit lyrics
From the clearance isle gimmicking tryin to mimic this image y'all better off packin a picnic wit a mortician bitches
I'm chopper doin it properly; monster inc. wit the fitest gettin timid any min makin it vivid;scarin you is the business
And I'm addicted to workin; committed to over-workin and rippin a verse on purpose; I admit it Mizury’s vicious
Packing semen of a demon being a heathen beating seeds in any region making a legion while I'm reading it like I'ma rapping yakkin Charles Manson
While I be given a reason for you to believe in I'm a beast beasting it every season teething and feasting feeding Off beats like I'm treating myself for my own personal satisfaction
Acting up acting out with the action with tactics putting tax on the verses I'm no freestyler my style isn't free febreezing it fresh with the way that I be serving up the motherfucking murder
When working overtime being a hard worker performing that lyrical serial killer horror Halloween when I'm on the scene making it reality Optimiz Prime sort of like a Transformer
While packing a quarter of dab like a disorder dabbing upon these motherfuckers, swerve
When I hit them with the words merged in a verse converted in a sweet entree serving dessert first
Chopper tongue twisting it with a curve gassing them till it burns I'm that Chopper they warned you about to ask around about me to get to chopping properly and when you ready to pay attention and stay steady and learn
Oh y'all don't see things the way we be seeing the action
Burn the stage down with some TLC like it's left eye playing with some matches
Space shuttle flow from the mo better hold on never will I be a Tech 9 my Rhymes are to Gatling gun
Stunting as the white boy bringin that white noise being a little bit strange when I bang avoiding you average fucks
I be shittin in the booth like a porta potty while rocking a potty mouth dropping two's just to piss out number ones
Staying suited and booted to be a party-pooper when I'm losing my shit because bitch i stay shitting in the club
FINISH HIM
Bigga the nigga the bigga the figgs the godzilla in killin with the syllables drillin em full in any venue when i pull the heater fire breather
Drinking ether by the liter my meter staying full no sleep for the wicked I'm living a dream makin it a reality with a salary with the talent that I was born with like a leader given
Wisdom listen to my ignition Hemi ripping with the cyborg flow with the ambition to slap you bitches out of the bed with a Folgers can to get you to wake up and vision
Us underground choppers on a mission Worldwide Choppers all over the world riding a beat with ease collecting money because that's our motherfucking business
Mad
