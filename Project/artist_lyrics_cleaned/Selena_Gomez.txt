I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

I'm on my marquise diamonds

Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad

Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You might also like
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants,

I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night (Ah)
Drunk on a feelin', alone with the stars in the sky

I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you

Saw the dark side of the moon
