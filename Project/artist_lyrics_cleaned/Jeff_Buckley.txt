Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child?
You know how much I need it

Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one

So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?

Oh, oh, oh
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mhm

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him

My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come

It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
How long will I wait for you?
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too
