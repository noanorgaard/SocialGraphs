But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow

The hangover I'll go through, won't have nothing on you
So bartender, how 'bout another round?
Yea, I know that I'm ignoring all the warnings
But I'll worry about the morning in the morning

Cause baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow
You might also like
When this temporary whiskey fix is over
And it dawns on me that I need you when I'm sober
So maybe you're right, it's time
To get over you and get on with my life

But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear that I'm not drowning in my sorrow
Girl I know I'll never love you again, til tomorrow
Til
