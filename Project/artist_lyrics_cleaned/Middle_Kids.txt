I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open, sucked me in and I went down

I came a little closer to the truth that day
I heard its call in the alleyway
And the one resounding answer that I could take
Is that I don’t know nothing and I got no way

And then the road cracked open, sucked me in, and I went down
Now standing face to face with the king of the underground
Some things just don’t add up, I’m upside down, I’m inside out
