I took him from the start, I can hold it down
I can't even lie, I'm the truest
Put that on everything, on everything
What can I say? Anytime, anyplace
I be on it (Ah yeah, ah yeah)
Not many know what it takes, how to handle this lady
Yeah, I own it (Ah yeah, ah yeah)

Baby, believe me, this won't ever stop
(Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't stop)
I can make this look easy, got this on lock

Yeah, that's me right there
(Can't stop, won't stop, hold up)
Yeah, that's my man
(Can't stop, won't stop, hold up)
Yeah, that's me right there
Can't nobody love that man
Like I love that man
That's me right there
That's me right there
I ain't ever goin' nowhere (Can't stop)
He ain't ever goin' nowhere (Won't stop)
That right there (Hold up)
That's me right there
