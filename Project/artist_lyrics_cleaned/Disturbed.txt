In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
You might also like
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of

Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh)
Open your eyes
See-through the disguise won't you open your eyes?
(Open your eyes)
(Hey! Hey!)

You've lost your sense from the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Become whole again and let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you

You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see (Can't you see)
Are you afraid to be exposed to the demons around you?

Open your eyes
See-through the disguise won't you open your eyes?

You would all be running in a world you cannot hide
And the end is coming for the lemmings standing in line
Overcome it, let the fury build inside
It could all be broken if you only opened your eyes
(Whoa-oh-oh, hey!)
Open your eyes

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope
And we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Ah, ah, ah, aw

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

Ah
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why

You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time

When the heart is cold, there's no hope

I can't let you go
Yes, I am stricken and can't let you 

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes (Oh)
No, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me
You might also like
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes (Oh)
No, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

And when I dream
(Ha, ha)
And when I dream
(Ha, ha)
And when I dream
(Ha, ha)
And when I dream
"No, Mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No, Mommy, don't hit me, ah
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me, ah-ah
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch
Fuck you, I don't need this shit
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die"

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over
