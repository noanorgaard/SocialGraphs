Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me (Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start, (Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)

I get kind of hectic inside
Mm, baby, I'm so into you

Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over

With my boyfriend, my laughin' boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
