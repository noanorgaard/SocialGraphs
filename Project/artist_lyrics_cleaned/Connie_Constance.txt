Dancing to the beat of my heart
Up to my knees in grass
Sticks and stones can't leave scars
When I'm under the stars (x5)

Looking for a clearer path
Mouth wide open cause I'm tired of the past
Wanna leave Earth and learn to live on Mars
Build a UFO thats faster than your moms car
Stick out my tongue to the rain
Clear my face from the pain
Running in circles, insane
Life it's but a childs game


Looking for a clearer path
Mouth wide open cause I'm tired of the past
Wanna leave Earth and learn to live on Mars
Build a UFO thats faster than your mom's car
Trying to grab a shooting star
Put it in a pocket take it home to my jar
Watch it manifest my own little universe
Let the others jest while I shouldn't move the EarthYou might also
