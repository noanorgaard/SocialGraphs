I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold

And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing

Some people lie, but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I'm close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
(Ooh)

I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
'Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

Some people try, but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I'm close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

1 ContributorABADDON Lyrics
Yuh, yuh, yuh *laughs*
She’s back
I can’t wait for this
Ready? 1, 2, 3—

If they wanna break the law
Then go ‘head and break it back
If they wanna take the land
Yeah, go ‘head and take it back
If they wanna shoot at us
We’ll go ‘head and shoot ‘em back
And if they ask us if we’re serious, just tell ‘em—

Uhh
Yeah, we’re serious like a heart attack
Fibrillation, cardiac
They groomin’ killers, zodiac
Develop war, darkroom, Kodak
We carry the nation, got bad backs
No scoliosis, straight to the fact
That people are pissed, elеven mil deep
And we take it to thе streets, okie dokie
No hokey pokey, right foot, left
A dead canary’s final breath
Got gas in the lungs, their hate over love
Brownshirts with guns, yeah, that’s what I see
Peace unlikely (Yeah, yeah)
You’s a Nazi (Yeah, yeah)
Roll the dice, no snake eyes
Bitch, we callin’ fuckin’ Yahtzee
What the fuck? (What the fuck?)
The fuck is this shit?
You want a civil war
So fear’s what you elicit
Stay peaceful en dehors
Whenever life permits it
But the fire’s en dedans
This Abaddon is embryonic
Bitch, I’m on it, so iconic
Moves tectonic, fast like sonic
Wake the sleepers, catatonic
Eat the rich, so economic
Make it grow like hydroponics
Sound it out like Hooked on Phonics
Small egos, Napoleonic
All you dicks are microscopic

Just tell ‘em heart attack
If they wanna break the law
Then go ‘head and break it back
If they wanna take the land
Yeah, go ‘head and take it back
If they wanna shoot at us
We’ll go ‘head and shoot ‘em back
And if they ask us if we’re serious
Just tell ‘em
And if they ask us if we’re serious, just tell ‘em—

You know we been callin’ and callin’ and callin’
This empire’s towers are fallin’, we’re tired of holding them up
Bloodthirsty white colonizers
Political liars, and funeral pyres are done
Tryin’ to intimidate, bitch
You just made enemies of the state
No, the fact of the matter’s not up for debate
You’ll remember the name, you shouldn’t have given us guns
Bitch, we’re armed
One republic, counting stars
Forget the world, chasing cars
There’s no patrolling burning hearts
I’m carrying plates like a waitress
So rotten inside, you attainted
Your evil will soon be abated
I’m steppin’ on you like a damn dominatrix
You’re clutching your crucifixes whenever you
See all the cicatrixes left from the
Harm that your people inflicted
You’re unrestricted, bitch, get convicted
Yeah, just remember you’re temporary
That you’re expendable
The system isn’t broken, y’all still
Hopin’ it’s amendable
Tenacity commendable
Audacity condemnable
We’ve revolutionized before
We’re doing it again, you know
We’re not going back
To how things were, it’s just a fact
That we are slaves to the rich
Now it’s our turn to bite ‘em back
If they wanna break the law
Then go ‘head and break it back
If they wanna take the land
Yeah, go ‘head and take it back
If they wanna shoot at us
We’ll go ‘head and shoot ‘em back
And if they ask us if we’re serious
Just tell ‘em heart attack
If they wanna break the law
Then go ‘head and break it back
If they wanna take the land
Yeah, go ‘head and take it back
If they wanna shoot at us
We’ll go ‘head and shoot ‘em back
And if they ask us if we’re serious
Just tell ‘em
And if they ask us if we’re serious, just tell ‘

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no

Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb

To get up and get out of the town we were raised
Yeah, 'cause we were done
I remember
We were sleeping in cars, we were searching for Oz
We were burning cigars with the white plastics tips
'Til we saw the sun
But we said crazy things like

Just because they're younger days
