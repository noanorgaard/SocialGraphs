Set them up, I'll knock 'em down
Another drink, Another round we go
I don't know which road to take
Holding on, for heaven's sake
Looking for the words to say to you
And I feel the push and pull
Taste the flesh and lose your soul
I'll think that I'll just let go to you
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall
Oh-oh
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall
Oh-oh
Oh I like the way she looks
Hope she cleans and hope she cooks
Take her home, a second look
Well is this sex or is it love
Hoping you don't call my bluff
Either way, you're something that I need
You might also likeAnd I feel so justified
Laying next to you tonight
Hear the sound, it's calling out to me
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall
Oh-oh
You gotta lean into the fall
Lean into the fall
Oh-oh
No, I can't find you
No, I don't want to
No, I can't find you
No, I don't want to
No, I can't find
