She left me and said
Baby won't you come to bed
But I cannot sleep
While the sun's awake

And the nights been so long
You don’t get me right, don’t get me wrong
Now my head tells the tales
I hardly know

I remember t-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
In the backseat together
And the seatbelts were burning our fingers
In the t-shirt weather
I remember sleeping to the early afternoon

Drinks fly like birds
Across the kitchen trouble stirs
I'm tongue tied by words
I used to know

So we talk 'til we're sick
17 went far too quick
When my mind plays tricks
I have to go

I remember t-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
In the backseat together
And the seatbelts were burning our fingers
In the t-shirt weather
I remember sleeping to the early afternoon

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

I remember t-shirt weather
I remember some days
We were singing our lungs out
In the backseat together
And the seatbelts
Were burning our fingers
In the t-shirt weather
In the t-shirt weather
In the t-shirt weather
Yeah in the t -shirt
