Okay, it's first place or fail bitch
Get white girl to a pale bitch
Say I won’t leave you stranded
Like hairnets, then I bail bitch
You need help? See a therapist
I ain't out here saving hoes
She said I’m insane
Too vain, varicose
I’m going deep, baritone
Blowing on the very strong
That Hercules, I murder beats
You don’t know me, you were very wrong
I’m on the way to the bank
I can't be touched like I’m rollin' a tank
Shout out to NEM for supplying the bass
The flow is so dirty I hired a maid
You might also likeShit, speaking of dirty what’s up with these dames?
I will not eat if the pussy ain't shaved
Ew
We are not on the same page
We are not in the same league
Weed, lean, you trying to get high
Whatever you need, I know a guy
I told you already, now is my time
We here to party, please don't be shy

One shot for my new bitch
Two shots for my old one
Three shots let’s do this
Four shots I’m so gone
Five, six, seven, eight
Wait what's up with the hate?
You shouldn’t worry about me dog
You should be getting this cake

Stomping in my timbo's
Hopping out the limo
Chain swing like medals
Get up on my level
Two bad bitches with me
Kylie, Kendall, Kendall, Kylie
Kylie Kendall
Okay this beat knocking, this beat knocking
Like someone trying to get in
You keep jocking, You keep jocking
No I don’t want to be friends
I work like every day
I don’t really have weekend
But, I am my own boss
So if I want to I sleep in
Usually I’m up early
Handling business that doesn't concern me
Unless it's about women, money, rapping
Money, women, fashion
G'd up I stay flier ay
You know the saying, you can’t buy taste
These girls are all on me
And I throw em' wood like a fire place
I rep the empire state
Home of the some of the greatest ever
I need me a place out west
Don’t really fuck with rainy weather
I’ve been looking in Cali
But I wouldn't mind Arizona
Stay low key, this fame shit bring paranoia
Boy you know I spit them jalapenos
For the pesos not a day goes
By that I’m not stacking up like Legos

Okay, you see its first place or fail bitch
Feel me, like brail bitch
Pants a little tighter
But its hammer time I nailed it

Stompin in my timbo's
Hoppin out the limo
Chain swing like medals
Get up on my level
Two bad bitches with me
Kylie, Kendall, Kendall, Kylie
Kylie,
