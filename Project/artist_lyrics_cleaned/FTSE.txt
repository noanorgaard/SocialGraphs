Heartbeat, Headstone
Even 'gainst tile, As you're seeing monochrome
I feel it through my fingers
Electric Shocks, through skin and bones
Down my spine it tingles
And I float
Float, float, float
And I float
Float, float, float
Inhales deepen
And I'm lingering like smoke
Trailing out I'm seepin'…out
Chasing the wind blows
Conscience shifted, feet are liftin' up
I…I
And I float
Hanging from my shoulders
Swingin' like a metronome
Sinkin' to a rythme
Breathing in Stereos
Like punching under water
Reaching out in slow motion
Crestin' and breakin', oxygen oceans
And I float
Float, float, float
And I float
Float, float, float
Inhales deepen
And I'm lingering like smoke
Trailing out I'm seepin'…out
Chasing the wind blows
Conscience shifted, feet are liftin' up
I…I
And I float

DUST… settlement, settle in
Inhales deepen
And I'm lingering like smoke
Trailing out I'm seepin'…out
Chasing the wind blows
Conscience shifted, feet are liftin' up
I…I
And I
