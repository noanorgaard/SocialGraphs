Q, I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
It's evident that you intelligent, but you can't escape that life
And for you, my nigga, I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But it's hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of a cracker, I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them runway jets?
Fly to Singapore, one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to God, its hard out here for a young black man to live
If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga, won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter?
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time, know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HGC, no A/C
Got the block hot, you keep runnin', cops say "freeze"
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, Birds or the Beez
Birds or the Beez
Birds or the Beez
Tired of the same ol' shit
Niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant
Keep these niggas right up out the game
Get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music, boy and leave this dope alone and count my change

Count my change
Count my 

Oh, oh, luxury

Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, prolly off a Norco

Nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo-doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm focused
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down, down
(Woo, woo) Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah

Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year
