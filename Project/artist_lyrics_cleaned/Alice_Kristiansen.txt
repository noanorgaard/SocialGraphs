How are you spending your time?
I'm spinning round passin' days
Stuck inside this retrograde
Sunsets and sunrise
I'm somewhere in between
Living on dreams of you
Deep inside this twilight blue

Perfect porcelain
Drawing constellations with the freckles on my skin
Starlight shining through your eyes
The warmest kind of glow
And I just need to know

How are you spending your time?
I'm spinning round passin' days
Stuck inside this retrograde
Sunsets and sunrise
I'm somewhere in between
Living on dreams of you
Deep inside this twilight blue
You might also like
I could light the Heavens on fire
With all the love I have inside

How are you spending your time?
I'm spinning round passin' days
Stuck inside this retrograde
Sunsets and sunrise
I'm somewhere in between
Living on dreams of you
Nothing else I can do
Deep inside this twilight blue

Mmmmm
Twilight blue
Mmmmm
Twilight
