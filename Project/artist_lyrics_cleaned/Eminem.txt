'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, this shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat 

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck, I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, 

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who", "Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, "How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

Ha-ha
I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand 

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you" — "No, you ain't
Come back" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that’s the culprit, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you 

I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too

Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

That's about as far as your body goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?

We just met and I just fucked you

I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game

Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great"
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax

Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on 'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me
Or I'ma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither
You ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too
You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you

You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

Hahaha
I'm just playin', ladies
You know I love you


Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down
Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed (Get along with)
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head (You're tryin' to)
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath (And you think I'm)
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, 

Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand-new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusa—
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand-new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
You might also like
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there, someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy, we got you on tape"
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh, boy, just touch my body
I mean, girl, just touch my 

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

And if I stumble, I won't crumble

But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)
A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I 

Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?

Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, "Woo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

Fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old can't afford to be
A lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the old, H-I to the new, que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient, I won't make no more mistakes, shit, my
Potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit, I ain't even s'posed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image, I mirror it when I stand near it

Same shit, different toilet, oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him the way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm as calm as
The breeze, I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms, I'm a
Superstar, girl, I'm ready for you, Mama

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first, I'll kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shake it so nervously
Take your time, baby, ooh, you're the bomb, baby
Ooh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?

You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up

SLIM SHADY
OR SHOULD I SAY EMINEM

Phil:
The nutshack has come back to bring some ass
You think you are the greatest rapper ever? I give you a pass
Your songs don't come close to a killshot
You look like you got beat up at a parking lot
I got my own animated show, while you were part of a crappy movie
You don't have any way to stay groovy
With your bad behavior, you are the monster, Slim
My crew will always hate you, right up to the brim
I've had enough of your shit, I'll never love the way you lie
Your dad abused you so bad, it's like he wanted you to die
Everytime you committеd crimes, you lose yourself
Losing your tеmper is, bad for your health
Slim Shady Show:
I’m a Godzilla, god killing frauds when they popin off the top grab ya balls and chop em off end this beef but add some broth then force feed this mother fucker while I’m calling ya mom
While I’m duel wield chainsaws, till your brains gone, “you done son?” not yet ma, I’m busy murdering these wannabe South Park knock offs, I mean my god! Your animation so bad make me want to eat some buck shot

AWESOME RAP, 

Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles
Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do it well
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my deathbed
Screamin', "F that",  yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, "Settle your fuckin' ass down
I'm ready for combat, man"
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as
Nuts, lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch
Need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack
In his hatchback, trailer hitch attached
To the back (Dispatch)
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp?
Does Lil Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp? Does a word search
Get circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up, are you insane?
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is light-
Ning, and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then, how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie
While I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty, shorty, I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgement is clouded, must
Just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder (Ah)
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"
'Cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario
Though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though (Ah)
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, you don't understand
I don't do this for anyone ever"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say? I'll say
You can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, JAY, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?

She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, "Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care"
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available, now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day," bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile, you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with her
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la-love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before

And I told her, "Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna
Go do what you wanna do, I don't care"

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her keychain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick, now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin', but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch, cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, "Okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?"
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She's screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat, like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up, like, "Fuck it, I've had it
I'm checkin' into rehab," I confess I'm a static addict
I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch, combative, possessive
In fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful drivin'
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin' "rape"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of
Wait, "dinner at eight"?
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the
Game of love, love, love, love


I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis

Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna

You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind

Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'

See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you) What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No)
There's a **** year old little ****
Laying dead with a slit throat, in your living room
Haha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you? (No)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you
Oh my God, I love you How the fuck could you do this to me?
(I'm sorry) How the fuck could you do this to me?
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault
"Oh my God, I'm crackin' up" Get a grip, Marshall
Hey, 'member the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat (No)
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We could've—, hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah! Somebody help"
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat

And I want you to say that

Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

With every breath in my lungs

Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?

Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe

I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*), "Back is the incredible!"

Geez, you guys are so sensitive

I'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted

'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!
(Shady, haha)

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse, the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though (Face though)

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh-huh)

Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage? Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole

Shit's finna get thick again

Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah)
They call me a freak, 'cause
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom and the opponent is gettin' no
Mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Don't hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No (No love), no (No love), no (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No (No love), no (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (

Step by step (Oh), heart to heart (Heart to heart)
Left, right, left, we all fall down (All fall down, all fall down; all fall down)
Like toy soldiers (Oh)
Bit by bit (Bit by bit), torn apart (Torn apart)
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me, "Stay out," this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you callin' names, and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him, mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.​
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, 'cause
Step by step (Oh), heart to heart (Heart to heart)
Left, right, left, we all fall down (All fall down, all fall down; all fall down)

Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
"But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'"
"But, baby, wait!" "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real"
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

*Curtains 

I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
'Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter, gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that

Kings never die

Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed to
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, 'cause

They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, 'cause makin' the beat
Ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die
Kings never 

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—
Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you 

Man, first of all I'm a boss (Woo)
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates, and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid, so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call 'em 'tramp stamps'
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow, I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (Woo)
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin', “Die, Santa”
Missed the tree, and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders (Yeah)
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' 1's, 5's, 10's or even 20's
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the North, East and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South-parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, come on!

Now, whether you're black, white, or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil, and you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a 5-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up
Now, you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let's have us a little bash

I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo"
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

Woo
Fuck is wrong with you?


I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you
Without 

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—
You might also like
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life


You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a "Fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same road)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, 

I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, "C'mon, son!"
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll— wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
