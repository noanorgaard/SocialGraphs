(Ayy) I see you lookin', but you tryna act cool, right?
(Ayy) You don't even really care what I do, right?
(Ayy) Probably wanna pick, probably want two, right?
Pretty girls get ugly when the mood right
Little mood light, go ahead and let it go
I don't mean to come across too sexual, oh, oh
But that ass is epic though
Titanic saga
Volcanic, hot lava
We burnin' up, I could serve it up
Like Luke, I am your father
Only if you wanna take a dip in each other's waters
Take this bedroom and turn it into a sauna

She's sending me drinks, I fed her one back
She said, "Ayy, boy, you're drinkin' too fast"
And we can take it slow
You'll never be alone
Just tell me it's all you tonight
You might also like
All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through
All you tonight, all you

If I want her, I'ma get her
Send the waitress over
Quit that bougie shit, girl
Bend that ass over
Mr. Round of Applause
I can do it with no hands
I go hard in the paint
She ain't even got a chance
Don't come by yourself (Uh-uh)
Bring a couple friends (Woo)
Sold out shows, all in Japan (Woo, woo)
Tell your friends I'm the man (Woo, woo)
Ask your man (Drop it)
Wipe me down, down
Make that ass clap, clap
Make that ass clap, clap

Yo, this that dance floor 808
She hit me like a 808
Have you on like vodka straight
Bottles up, you and me
Me and you on a trip
All night flight, girl, let's dip
Lickin' my lips, I'm in the zone
