I wake up everyday
Try to take control
Of things I cannot fix
I cannot face alone
I need you by my side
My one and only friend
I cannot let it pass
I cannot let it in

And I pray

Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars

Let's lay down in the grass
With our old and worn out shoes
Looking at the stars
On a blanket made for two
It starts to get cold
You let me know you're near
It's your warmth that reminds me
How much I need you here
You might also like
And I pray
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars

Some day
You drift away
I'll be left to dream
Some day

Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the stars
Baby, it's you and I
Baby, it's you and I
Living up in the sky
Getting lost in the
