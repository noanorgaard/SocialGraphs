I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before
You might also likeMy heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll

Sing once 

I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell
Auf Wiederseh'n, adieu

Adieu, adieu
To yieu and yieu and yieu
You might also like
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiederseh'n

I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

So long, farewell
Auf Wiederseh'n, goodbye

I leave, and heave
A sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye

I'm glad to go
I cannot tell a lie

I flit, I float
I fleetly flee, I fly

The sun has gone
To bed and so must I
So long, farewell
Auf Wiederseh'n, goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
