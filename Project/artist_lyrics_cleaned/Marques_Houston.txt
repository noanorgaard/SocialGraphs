Baby, look, I'm tired of trying
To convince you that I ain't caught up lying
When she walked passed me I looked
So what? Big deal
I don't understand how that can make you feel
That my love ain't for real

(Every day I thank the Lord above that you're with me)
You're with me
(Tell me why would I throw that away?)
Why would I throw that away?
(What can I do to prove that this is where I wanna be?)
Yeah
So I may look occasionally
You're the only one I need

If I wanted (That girl)
Then I would be with (That girl)
(But that one ain't for me)
Hey, she's fine as hell but she'll always be (That girl)
Yeah, nothing more than (That girl), yeah
(No matter what she do, she don't compare to you)
Check
You might also like
What you yellin' for? (Why you screamin'?) Huh
Girl, you act as if you just caught me cheating
When you look at other men, and don't act like you don't
I don't trip because I know that I'm the guy
You come home to every night, baby, yeah

(Every day I thank the Lord above that you're with me)
That you're with me
(Tell me why would I throw that away?)
Yo, why would I throw that away?
(What can I do to prove that this is where I wanna be?)
Yeah
Though I may look occasionally
You're the only one I need

If I wanted (That girl)
Then I would be with (That girl), yeah
But that one ain't for me
Yo, she's fine hell but she'll always be (That girl)
And nothing more than (That girl)
No matter what she do, she don't compare to you
Hey, yeah, check it
I, know I, need you right here with me
Oh I know I need you
No other girl will do
'Cause I need you
Right here with me
Oh I, need you
Whoa-ho

(That girl)
Then I would be with (That girl), yeah
(But that one ain't for me)
Hey, she's fine as hell but she'll always be (That girl)
And nothing more than (That girl)
(No matter what she do, she don't compare to you)
Oh, said if I wanted (That girl)
Then I would be with (That girl), oh-ho
(But that one ain't for me)
Oh, she's fine as hell but she'll always be (That girl)
Nothing more than (That girl), yeah
(No matter what she do, she just can't be you)
Yeah

If I wanted that girl
I would be with that girl
But that one ain't for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be that girl
Nothing more than that girl
No matter what she do, she just can't be you,
