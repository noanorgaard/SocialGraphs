Baby, turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low

Run a bath and pop a little champagne
I, I love the way we celebrate
Oh, cause you know
That I'm good with watching old movies
Playing footsie, ah underneath the sheets
Oh, let's go-o-woah

Don't need to take me downtown
We're having this fun when no one's around
We know what happens here
When the lights go down, lights go down
The lights go down, the lights go down

Baby, turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo

Gonna turn all the lights down low, oh, yeah, 

We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood

He don't take my rebel heart and try to fix me
But 'round the house there's always something that needs fixing
Bridges that generation gap
Wins over grandma, mom and dad
Sticks by me through the good, the bad and ugly
If I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
Hey, hey, hey

We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time (Every time)
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood
Mmm, yeah

Go back to nineteen-sixty-seven (Come on)
Yeah, he always keeps me guessing
Little rough around the edges
Disappear into the sun set
Oh
We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time
We ride (Yeah)
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time (Back in time, yeah)
Every time
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood
Oh oh, yeah
Oh, if I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
