Little lady
You look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say
And tonight I wanna make you mine
We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time
Oh, no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight

'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

Sweet lady
Don't you look away
I don't mean to make you shy
But we haven't got much time
Tonight, I know just what to say, yeah
I'll love your cares away
And you and I will find a way
You know that there's a possibility
That we'll never get this chance once again
Oh, no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight
Baby, tonight
'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute

'Cuz I can't wait another minute (No I can't)
I can't wait another minute for your love

Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
