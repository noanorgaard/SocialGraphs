I'm holding on to you
And you're holding on to me
But not forever don't you see
You're only young for one and
You running through these sheets
And falling really deep into your love
I hope we never have to meet again
I have a heavy heart and I can see the end
I'll promise I'll be fine 'cause
You're eyes are just so beautiful you'll never know

Oh what you gonna do my love
Man what you gonna my love, my love
It's raining out a palm of ideas
And I'm trying to find the answer myself
You need to change yourself my love
Hating on yourself my love, my love
Don't listening to things
You have the answers are all in yourself
You might also like
I'm holding on to you
Before I go to sleep
I fall into my sheets
I'm drowning in the room
Our hearts are playing games
We're such a shame that we have to lose
Tell me you that you change
Just to feel the same
My feelings are all bruised
You were supposed to be the one
That make me feel like 'ooh'
It's best we fade away
Time can only change what we went through
I really loved you
And I'm sorry I'm this cruel


Oh what you gonna do my love
Man what you gonna my love, my love
It's raining out a palm of ideas
And I'm trying to find the answer myself
You need to change yourself my love
Hating on yourself my love, my love
Don't listening to things
You have the answers are all in yourself
So baby don't you worry no more x4

What you see in me
You are strong
Don't forget me
He is yours
Talk to me
Let me go
