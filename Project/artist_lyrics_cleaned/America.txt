I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was lookin' at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go
I know
'Cause a free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying, no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Wishin' on a falling star
Waitin' for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by purple rain
Aw, come on, Joe
You can always change your name
Thanks a lot, son, just the same

Well, I keep on thinking about you, Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you, can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor correspondent and I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle?
Will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little?
Just enough to show you care
Well, I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin'
I just can't make it
