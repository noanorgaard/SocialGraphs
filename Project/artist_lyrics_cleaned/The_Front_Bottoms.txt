There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through

There's comfort in the bottom of a swimming pool
I'm holding my breath for you
There's no doubt in my mind
That if you could, then you would try
To crack my ribcage open
And pull my heart right through

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last

There's comfort in the silence of a living room
The TV is on for you
Hide in your basement
While your house burns down
Your teeth are loose inside of your gums
They will eventually fall out
Follow an orange extension cord
Under a carpet, to a closet door
Feeding the black light
That will someday make me very, very, very
Very, very rich

But I'm a creature
Of a culture that I create
And I'm the last one on the dance floor
As the chandelier gives way
And I am permanently preoccupied with your past
I've been around long enough now
To know that the good things never last
They never last
How low is your self esteem?
How low could it possibly be?
And I know, I know, you're in love with me
And I've been ignoring you
To listen press "one", to record a message press "two"
What the fuck is wrong with you, you fuckin' moron?
You fuckin' moron, what the fuck is wrong with you?
You pick up the girl, you're done, it's over with, you fuckin' idiot!

I will stop cutting my pants into shorts
I will address the issues I cannot ignore
And I will do the things I think you might like
And I will be alone, probably the rest of my life

You're very close to bein' the dumbest motherfucker I've ever met in my life
I'm starting to think you'd be the dumbest motherfucker to ever walk this earth
I'm givin' you advice
Turn around right now
Who the fuck

It's wrong, what you're doing is wrong
That you "needed the closure", well, how is this better?
What the fuck did you drive to her house for?
"Closure"? What "closure"?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Breaking up with you. Done. Bye

Just you and me
Getting high, and hanging out
Getting high, and messing around
Getting high, and trying to figure it out

There was a sacrificial ritual inside my room last night
Was held there in secret, hard to see anything in the candle light
Now there is melted wax all over my floor
And the scent of incense is rising up from underneath the door
Now, maybe it was not as serious as I am making it sound

Just you and me
Getting high, and hanging out
Getting high, and messing around
Getting high, and trying to figure it out

I feel the burn, my tired feet
Not much to go, a few more streets
See, your face is all I need
My one and only, my sweet relief
And you would think I never had it
The way that this world likes my magic
But it was all for you, to continue to be able
To continue to be able right now

I don't need your reasons anymore

I’ve been sitting here, all by myself, laughing

I put my wrong finger in the hot wax
Now I can't play for you like that
The last thing I need is truly
The stupid excuse for a reason to fight back
I can't begin, begin to tell you
The way it all felt when everything fell through

You moved to New York to meet a beautiful girl
And drink fancy cocktails without a care in the world
But you got scared they're all gonna find someone else
So you find one and tell it things you're dying to tell
We got high as hell, (The record) I forget how it went
It was a song about love, and at the time, it made sense
When the side ended, we just laid there in bed
You had fallen asleep, but I stayed up and read
I made a list of everything I said I never meant
Considered all the things I never said, but I digress
I got dressed, kissed your forehead, and left
You called me when you woke, but I was sleeping off the
