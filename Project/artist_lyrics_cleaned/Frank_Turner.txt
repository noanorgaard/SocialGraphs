Amélie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights
The problem with falling in love in late night bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every—

Things got fractious, and I felt faithless
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart
But baby, I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate
I let slip my guard, I let go of the rudder
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another

Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up everything
Give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing
Every little goddamn thing

And I've been skirting round the rim
Of doing something brave
And not just standing, but jumping in
Of making circles into squares
Of laying down the bare facts
Like a burden I can't bear
And I can almost find the words
But I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse upon your pretty lips
The pressured white behind your fingertips
And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuckups and my faults
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together
So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
Just give me one fine day of plain sailing 

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right

And I've been waking in the morning just like every other day
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain
And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
But you're not lying there any longer
And I know that that's my fault
So I've been pounding on the floor and
I've been crawling up the walls
And I've been dipping in my darkness with Serotonin-boosters
Cider and some kind of smelling salts!

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right

And on the first night we met you said, "Well darling, let's make a deal
If anybody ever asks us let's just tell them that we met in jail."
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like a stony-faced accomplice
But tonight I need to hear some truth if I'm ever getting through this
Yeah you once sent me a letter that said, "If you're lost at sea
Close your eyes and catch the tide my dear and only think of me"
Well, darling, now I'm sinking, and I'm as lost as lost can be
And I was hoping you could drag me up from down here towards my recovery

If you could just give me a sign, just a subtle little glimmer
Some suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
Then I would stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller
All the time
Because I know you are a cynic
But I think I can convince you
Yeah, cause broken people can get better if they really want to
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I am hoping to
Survive!

It's a long road up to recovery from here
A long way back to the light
A long road up to recovery from here
A long way to making it right
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover?
Darling, sweet lover, one day this will all be 

Things didn't kill me but I don't feel stronger
Life is short but it feels much longer
When you've lost that fight
Yeah, you've lost that hunger
To pull yourself through the day

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
So come on, everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

So we all have secrets that we hold inside
Yeah, the worst little things that you never confide
And the worst one of all that you just can't hide
Is that you're never quite as strong as you sound

So I'm sorry, baby, for the times I've hurt you
Sorry, friends, for the times I desert you
Most days it feels like I don't deserve you
And I wonder that you're all still around

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
So come on, everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

Come on and join me in the water
And we'll swim for home
Sometimes it's hard to remember
I couldn't do this on my own

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
I won't ask for anything more
The path I chose isn't straight and narrow
It wanders around like a drunken fellow
Some days it's hard for me to follow
But if you've got my back, I'll go on
If you've got my back, I'll go 

Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've found
Hanging out and drinking with my friends in the cathedral grounds
And later dodging drunks as we dance along Jewry Street
As we wander up town to The Railway, our friends to meet

There's something about coming back to your hometown again
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends
And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
I'm a Wessex Boy, and when I'm here, I'm home

Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've lost
Huddling for warmth on the top step of the Buttercross
Sitting on the benches by the bridges at the riverside
Of counting down the hours for the buses 'cause I missed my ride

There's something about coming back to your hometown again
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends
And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
I'm a Wessex boy, a Wessex boy, and when I'm here, I'm home

And one day I will hear this song anonymous and sweet
Ringing out from a busker's guitar on the ancient city streets
I'll pause a while and smile before I continue on alone
And somebody else will sing the words and I'll feel like I'm home

There's something about hometowns that you never can escape
The triumphs and the tragedies, the tortured little fates
The welling of nostalgia and a feeling kind of strange
'Cause despite the little changes, yeah, this place still feels the same

There's something about coming back to your hometown again

And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
