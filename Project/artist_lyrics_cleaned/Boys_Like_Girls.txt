Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind me
Answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away, forget yesterday

Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue (Taste it on my tongue)
The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad, it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me cryin', say hello to goodbye (Oh, yeah)
'Cause just one sip (Oh, yeah) would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now it's over

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinnin' 'round a roller coaster ride
The world stuck in black and white (Stuck in black and white)
You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush

All the time I wasted on you
All of the bullshit you put me through
I'm checkin' into rehab 'cause everything that we had
Didn't mean a thing to you

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, but now I'm sober

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over

'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?

And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, "Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors"
I don't wanna ever love another
You'll always be my thunder
So bring on the rain
And bring on the thunder

Today is a winding road
Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
Whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Today I'm on my own
I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
And now I'm itching for the tall grass and longing for the breeze
I need to step outside just to see if I can breathe
I gotta find a way out
Maybe there's a way out

Yeah, I'm walking on a tightrope
I'm wrapped up in vines
I think I'll make it out, but you just gotta give me time
Strike me down with lightning, let me feel you in my veins
I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain

Today is a winding road
That's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
Whoa
