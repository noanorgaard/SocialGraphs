That's it?
That... eh
That's-
That's all it is?
It sa-
It say-
It says "AMAZING!"
And it's just his-
His-
His face
I-in the corner?
After-
After-
After all that?
That I just went 

You said you'd be my dream, I could have you every night
And if by morning I'd forgotten you, well, no big deal, that'd be alright
'Cause you're the reoccuring kind
You are the reoccuring kind
You never really leave my mind

Are you the love of my lifetime? 'Cause there's been times I've had my doubts
We were just kids when I first kissed you in the attic of my parents' house
And I wish we were there now
I took so long to figure out
What this book has been about

Now I write when I'm away letters that you'll never read
You said, "Go explore those other women, the geography of their bodies
But there's just one map you'll need
You're a boomerang, you'll see
You will return to me

Well, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will
Oh, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will, you will

'Cause if you don't, then this book's all lies
If you don't, then my plans would all be ruined
If you don't, I'll start drinking like the way I drank before
Oh, oh, and I just won't have a future 

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here"

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up, I say "enough is enough
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon


And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away

I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase:
"If you love something, give it away"

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away
We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke, we're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
'Cause we're coming for you!


I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying, "Let me walk away, please"

You'll be free, child, once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where 

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me, I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening
By the morning won't exist

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag

I got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
That started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is

It was so simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
So simple in the 

Now it's two o'clock
The club is closed, we're up the block
Your hands on me
I'm pressin' hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth
Tryin' to keep the words from comin' out
You didn't care to know
Who else may have been you before

I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where is the kid with the chemicals?
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time
You said it feels good; I said I'll give it a try

Then my mind went dark
We both forgot where your car was parked
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning

Bad actors with bad habits
Some sad singers, they just play tragic
And the phone's ringin', and the van's leavin'
Let's just keep touching, let's just keep, keep singin'

I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where is the kid with the chemicals?
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind

But you, but you
You write such pretty words
But life's no storybook
Love's an excuse to get hurt, and to hurt
"Do you like to hurt?" "I do, I do!" "Then hurt me"
Then hurt me
Then hurt me, then hurt me
Then hurt me
Then hurt me
Then hurt me
Then hurt me
Then hurt me
Then hurt 

And so I thought I'd let you know
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm, mhm

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling, we just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery
Aha, mhm
Besides, maybe this time it's different
I mean, I really think you like
