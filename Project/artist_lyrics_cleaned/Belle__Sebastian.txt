But we don’t have the money
Money makes the wheels and the world go round
Forget about it, honey

Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms I remember
Everybody’s talking about you
Every word’s a whisper without you

But we don’t have the money
Money makes the wheels and the world go round
Forget about it, honey
Trouble’s never far away when you’re around
Cause we don’t have the money
Money makes the wheels and the world go round
Forget about it, honey

I didn’t see it coming
I'm just not in the running

Take me on a train ‘cause I’m not flying
I can see the world from a different side
Read about us in the morning papers
When we make it alive

I didn't see it coming (Make me dance, I want to surrender)
I'm just not in the running (Make me dance, I want to surrender)
And we don't need a lifetime (Make me dance, I want to surrender)
We’re following the right line (Make me dance, I want to surrender)
And we don't need a lifetime (Make me dance, I want to surrender)

Let me step out of my shell
That's wrapped in sheets of milky winter disorder
Let me feel the air again, the talk of friends
The mind of someone my equal

I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (Give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning, give me the afternoon
The night, the night

Tinseltown has followed me
From Tinseltown to grey adorable city by the docks
The girls are walking, moving air, the sun hangs low
The girls don’t care as they paint themselves at dusk

Towns' and cities' populations up and grow
The workers move to the suburbs
In between, I watch and go
I run alongside rush-hour traffic, a prayer for every car


I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)

I want to write a message to you
Everyday at ten o'clock in the evening
Yellow pearl my city is
This is your art, this is your Balzac, your Brookside, and your Bach


San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read
It always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may

I love you, I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place
Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job
Maybe, but not what she deserves

Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passerby
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like, "Walk Away, Renee"
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour

You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You're the funny little frog in my throat

My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
She gets the all highlights wrapped in pearls

I had a conversation with you at night
It's a little one-sided, but that's alright
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You've come to save my life again

I don't dare to touch your hand
I don't dare to think of you in a physical way
And I don't know how you smell
You are the cover of my magazine
You're my fashion tip, a living museum
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
I'll maybe tell you all about it
