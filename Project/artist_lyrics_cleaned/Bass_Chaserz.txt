Shawty too sweet like a now or later
Baby girl you a treat like a now or later
Got a girl from the creek I'll annihilate her
She gone get that pussy beat either now or later (4x)

Baby girl I'm a beast never been in the wrong
Okay baby girl I'm lying can I sing you a song
Baby girl you looking lonely so you tagging along
Started rubbing on your body started taking your thong, Off
Shawty said her man was on, Soft
Going hard on the job, Boss
Lips all on my bone, Dog

Suck it like a Jolly Rancher uh
But she lick me like a lollipop ayy
Little mama was a belly dancer yea
And I love it when she make it pop
Cute eyes thick thighs and a beautiful face
Really think I got an ace with some boom in her bass
You know I don't ever chase but I want a little taste
Little mama so sweet make a nigga say ayy
