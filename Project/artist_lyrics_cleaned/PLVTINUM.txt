Late night reminiscing
Shut your mouth
Just kiss me
I see lightning in your eyes
(Instrumental)
I think i'm drunk enough to say that I love you
Say that you want me too
Say that you want me too
You might also like
I know I'm thinkin' too much lately
I'm sick of sleepin' on my own
I know you're scared of slowing down and
Letting go
I just wanna go, be alone in my hotel
We can smoke a bowl, hit the road by the windows down
Maybe we can roll, drivin' slow
Take a chance on me

Late night reminiscing
Shut your mouth
Just kiss me
I see lightning in your eyes
(Instrumenta)
I think I'm drunk enough to say that I love you
Say that you want me too
Say that you want me too
Say that you want me too
I think I'm drunk enough to say that I love
