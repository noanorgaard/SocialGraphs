I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
No I'm not backing
No I'm not backing down

I've watch the game
I've stood on the side line
That same old same
But now it's my time, yeah
Cause if you don't stand for nothin'
You always fall for somethin'
This isn't how it's meant to be
So I'll just keep on walking
Let him do the talking
I'ma have to make a scene, yeah

I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down

Yeah, I been there, did that
Afraid to be me, so I hid that
Gripped with the fear, so I disappeared
Then dropped to the ground like a missed catch
But I, I'm done with that
You can tell 'em all that I'm done with that
No more backing down into the background
That’s now, cause I put them old habits down
I follow da leader
And where he may take me may make me a leader
It’s wrote on the wall all you need do is read it
Can’t be a lame duck and try to soar with the eagles
So I'm crossin' the line
Tell 'em all dog that I lost too much time
Ain't stayin' in this place cause I gotta win the race
And I'm runnin' for the crown
Ain't backin' down now
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, 

Oh, but we got real pain and real fears
Thirsting for the drying of our real tears
It's not satisfying anymore
Ain't it true that the veil was torn

I don't need no stained glass
To be washed in his blood
I don't need no perfect, put together pretty words
To be enough, no
I want Jesus and his real love
Something I crave deep inside of my bones
So you can leave your religion at home

Spent my life trying
To keep all the rules
Now I know it's about what he's already done
Not about what I think that I gotta do

I don't need no stained glass
To be washed in his blood
I don't need no perfect, put together pretty words
To be enough, no
I want Jesus and his real love
Something I crave deep inside of my bones
So you can leave your religion at home

I want real, real love, hey

I got real pain and real fears
Thirsting for the drying of real tears
It's not satisfying anymore
Ain't it true that the veil was torn

I don't need no stained glass
To be washed in his blood
I don't need no perfect, put together pretty words
To be enough, no
I want Jesus and his real love
Something I crave deep inside of my bones
So you can leave your religion at home
I want real, real love
I want real, real love
I want real, real love
Oh, ye—yeah,
