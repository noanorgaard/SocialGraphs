New world order making decision
I see feminism all up in em
You can tell by his tight denim
A black fascist over you bastards
So high you couldn't even see me
I'm moovin like the black musolini
Re arranging the borders
Child of the sun
We use to pack quarters inside your daughters
Slick rhymes
Around mind they loiter
A ricter scale when I hit California
Hands is registered Everlast
An outkast
Mom's sayin the stankonia
Gods words is proverbs observe
How I speak to you in graffiti
Nothing but black letters on white paper
7 series never wanted a scraper
They yellow tape off the crime scene
They white chalked off a blind dream
Premier it on a wide screen
All the crazy shit that my mind's scene
Devils with badges
Move like homosapians
Has god forsaken them
There's no mistaking it
Fight the power
We need to take it then
They banned the same shit they used to erase my men

Welcome to the new religion

Its like batons choose blacks to bat and bruise
Baton Russe
My hearts yearning for the way they shot sterling
Counting my earnings
I burned a bill for every grave turing
I always seem to cash out at the pastors service
Know we miss you
In my pockets got burried wet tissues
Mom's tears smeared on the torso of my brothers peers
Fearing I'll be the next nigga that'll disappear
Plan to fire back in the events of my final act
Great Gatsby
Leonardo Decapri
80 wavy it's getting crazy
Malcom max b
A fine Canine
And yeah I see these cats be
On the prowl running around tryna scratch me
Come catch me
And I stayed by your side
And I stayed by your side
And I stayed by your side
I pray you stay by mine
Welcome to the new religion

I swear to God
I hope you pray to God
Ya'll niggas wanna play with God
Fuck boy should've played your part
I take you out before I'm taking off
Silently I shot to the top
Silently I shot to the top
Silently I shot to the top
Team T till my fucken heart stop

I was God's contender
I was envious from his rage
I was God's avenger
I'm delirious in a phase
I know God remembers
I swayed millions toward your way
I arose to victor
Forbidden wisdom all written in gold scriptures
Seeds of knowledge they hide of abolish off
For fear or fascination of my past generation
Generating a cure for the diseased and anguished
Just an Aries made in the Aquarius age should distinguish
Farwell to all you gold diggers
Fuck niggas
Sponsored accomplishments for doing what most didn't
Heart on my sleeve worn out like a gold pendant
My soul shifted like dropping gears when down drifting
Looking around I see my towns different
Only idolizing the clowns that they see fitting
Unorthodox with the flow you'll see my styles different
I'll never compromise
Tilique on the rise
Fuck the other side

I swear to God
I hope you pray to God
Ya'll niggas wanna play with God
Fuck boy should've played your part

Silently I shot to the top

Team T till my fucken heart stop

It's a war of religion
Divided by our concious
Who shall be forgiven
Persuaded by our logic
Who's bound to forget it
Or spirit was the target
Who's down to give it
Who's the provider what your subscription
I'm breaking down barriers
While cell phone carriers determine your decisions
TMat collisions
DNA insinsions
Fuck a donkey of a day
When systematic gun play
Will send a slug in your direction
Pray for those who need protection
As a gavel sways
Nen come home enlightend
From a department that won't correct men
I stand corrected
I'm second guessing my blind theory
My uncle Kenny
He said the system will never hear me Got a cousin
Who caught caught a case
Like don't stand near me
The bail is Charles Manson
Since the 60 they feared me
I'm nearly a charismatic soul searching through the solstice
Leave these niggas alone was more focused coming home

He's saying I need to bounce back from Gem' like I was wack just before this
Like Checkpoint 3 after getting battered by Caustic
And I don't share that assessment, I thought I smashed it but for this
A couple people said they wanna hear that Raptor performance
You wanna hear that Raptor shit?
That 'no Geneva policies'
That 'whole demeanor bothers me'
That 'joker, fiend, a mockery'
That 'hopeless mediocrity with-' (no redeeming qualities)
So I wrote a little remix that I know you people wanna see
I'm a different sort of legendary, with a modern pedigree
You trippin' on an era we transitioned from successfully
Think he was the best MC, in a form that's dead now he
A, withered corpse a relic we just, digged up from the cemetery
Missin' your identity, drifted from it steadily
Clingin' for it desperately to this distorted entity, a bitter source of enmity
A twisted sort of effigy, a distant thought, a memory just livin' off his legacy
So you must be twisted off the Hennessy, you thought this would be close at all
Steal on him he's splittin' I take the money like Golden Balls
You always reference books, and get the title and who wrote it wrong
Actin' like a know-it-all, 'bout shit that you don't know at all
Like when the towers fell, how did the steel beams melt in 'em
I ain't fuckin' with Alexa, it's gettin' real Orwellian
You wish, this is no longer a scene you're welcome in
And if this was 1984, your style would still be relevant
See that's a old style that you do and they go wild when you use it in '09
But it's losin' it's old shine, now it's useless it won't fly
He just cruisin' this whole time being reduced in a gold mine that was boomin' to bone-dry and in ruins
Now you scrapin' out the barrel but, won't find the solution
And don't try 'cause his hubris is so bright it's consumed him
I'm cosigning the blueprint but don't like how you use it
To coast right through the movement with no sign of improvement
I'm out here snappin' like tourists in Harlem that's on the A train
Snappin' like DJ Khaled when his weight change
Snappin' like a Great Dane, snappin' like a Beyblade
Snappin' like SJWs in a safe space
Grew up called 'Jedi', the prophecy ain't dead and gone
It's young Skywalker, X-wing, upper echelon
You're young Skywalker 'cause you went to school with a helmet on
In the special room with the special kids, stretch him out, get my special on
Bars make the IRA redesign the letter bomb
Been tryin' to get it on, Dave Grohl with the Everlong
Gettin' drawn out from who I mail 'em from
This'll go left, the young fool back out me like Sessegnon
So watch yourself and watch your step
Less time watched together watchin' me with all your friends
Off your head, on the net, now act like I'm not the best
Now act like I'm not a threat
Tell 'em all you're not impressed, you think that we've forgotten then?
Oh you check the comment threads, what's been said, the compliments
I've gone all red, what blush, aw shucks, stop it Greg
As soon as this battle got dropped he got snider, sneak dissin'
Passive aggressive, he got hyper
Since he not top billin' on King Of The Dot fliers
Throwin' shade should lose that chain off his neck, like Scott Steiner
And saying I bit your Bigg K round in my title match too
Bro, what parts are the same, please describe me a few
Yours is a dream sequence, mine's the afterlife of the dude
Yours's about his anxiety, mine's about him tryna be cool
Yours is metaphor, mine's allegory, he's lyin' to you
So what we down to here then Greg, that the writin' is good?
Well fuck it, let's say me bitin' is entirely true
Congrats, the worst round of my career was inspired by you

Look, I never brought up the third, you bitin' my third round
But that was clever rapping, but question
How can you bite me when the actual event never happened?
Yo, plus you know that was some sick verses, I really like the wordage
Plus it happened in a round where sound doesn't exist: perfect, none of us heard it
Dog, you're just throwin' together a million multis, y'all think when he writes things
He be like "Hmmm, initiate multisyllabic rhyme scheme"
Loosen up, I mean I don't really- I'll put you in a hole that I dug up in the ground
I ain't fuckin' wit' this clown
He brought up Golden Ball 'cause it's no mystery I'm doin' numbers in this round
Got me openin' whisky to my moment of victory
Better knuckle up, you toe to toe with a grizzly
I pull a shank out, get to pokin' his kidneys
When I hold it against him don't, hold it against me
He gotta live in my shadow, winter solstice can miss me
Just cause son is obscure don't mean Soul'll eclipse me
You're not a threat, this so called Scottish vet scrawny body probably a buck twenty sopping wet
If I put hands on him, his cause of death would be, pocket check
Ironic, I'm at your wake talkin' 'bout what got you slept
Watch your step, get ya' body Dhalsim stretched, mop the floor with him, swab the deck
Shotty this ya' greatest? Well I'm not impressed
But I want the best, bring me ya' Soul then I'ma, leave with a GOAT's head like Baphomet
Dog I give a fuck how they rate you ho
Basic flow, in the killing fields that same approach an Achilles' heel, ankle broke
Will it heel? Pray it don't
Bitch I will, cave ya' skull
Don't, make me go, Bobby Flay on Soul
The, blade'll go in, takin' bones out
Bake him slow like fillet of sole
Blade is so big it'll leave his DNA exposed
That mean the machete sprayin' blood everywhere like a Danny Trejo role, play your role
I'm sayin' I'm Satan, yo Shotty, the venue's a little vacant bro
If you want to sell out, you just gotta trade ya' Soul
To hell wit' him
It's cool, I heard his team Shark City, I'm like the Sharks bit who?
I'll slaughter your whole team and make shark fin stew
I mean, I ain't wit' the whoopty whoop
He's just a baby Shark, doop doop dodoop dodoop
I'll knock him off the pedestal they placin' him on
He the biggest in Shark City, what you supposed to be? Megla Da Don
Speaking of, I heard you battled on URL, is it true?
Well, how did that go? Did you win? Did you lose?
I heard someone got bodied, was it him? Was it you?
Man, that shit was horrible Soul
Up there rantin' about beatin' Tony D like that's important to know
You tried to spit your little bars, they was bored with you though
Then four in got stopped like border patrol
The angle was not dope
And don't blame the crowd or act too artistic for the stage that you got smoked
Fuck- excuse my French, he think he Monet but he not close
Just made a terrible impression but maybe I'm paintin' with broad strokes
That shit was great to witness
Exposed his little racist image
I mean I knew he lost when Beasley listed one of his strengths as 'Privilege'
Shit, we in the UK but you ain't safe from gun violence
Amazing, you battle a Gemin1 but he still made it one sided
I mean he went from "I'm 'bout to body a lyricist" to "how they not take me serious?"
The crowd was probably delirious
They had Soul, beside himself, like a out of body experience
Follow me, all this work, tryin' to be they best rapper
Beat Cee Major then Raptor, couldn't even be main event after
Still not the Scottish GOAT, it must be a respect factor
Speaking of BA, they both have Scotland to rep
Both malnourished fiends - is it that hard is it, crack rock, is it meth?
I mean you wanna be him so bad, the last thought in my head
I thought URL taught you, you can't copy respect
Bodied on SMACK, outshined in huge ways
Cooked in Atlanta, outright got souffled
Sucked in Canada, that outlines his crusades
Think Brexit: money ain't worth shit outside the UK
And you wanna know why, you know why?
'Cause even when you're good, your personality is so bland
And that ain't just gonna change with all the multis you scratchin' in your notepad
You overcompensate, when you battle and you know that
And even named yourself after exactly what you don't have
A

Sometimes you make plans... sometimes they don't work outYou might also 

The guy came out, and he was, he was all like, "You're nobody," fuck- fucked up and shit  The other dude, the other dude was there, unsettling as fuck, and he was just totally fucked, like, totallyYou might also
