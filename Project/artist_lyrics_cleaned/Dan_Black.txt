It's been another long day
A slow motion emotion wave
Crashing over this sardine can train
And I'm at the back, squashed in tight
But it's okay 'cause inside I
Know when I get home tonight

It's torment into ecstasy
It's torment into ecstasy

I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me

Into the sheets, she and I slide
Heavy little , smiles open wide
Heads thrown back, sweet silent cry
Folds of sheets, clean and white
Rough and ripple like wings in flight
Like waves at night, like the tail of a kite
You might also like
It's torment into ecstasy
It's torment into ecstasy

I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me

Ah-ooh, ahhh
Ah-ooh, ahhh
Ah-ooh, ahhh
Ah-ooh, ahhh
Ah-ooh, ahhh
Ah-ooh, ahhh

It's torment into ecstasy

I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
I want that hot breath of life in me
Ah-ooh,
