My friend say I should live a little
Need to start saying yes more
I comprise and meet him in the middle
'Cause new actions will get you new results, huh
They gave me something to think about, huh
It's life and I'm supposed to live it out, uh huh
I'm holding on to the universe, huh
Praying that she don't let me down

I'm afraid if I try something crazy
I'mma end up in love, love, love
If the world that we live in is crazy
And it's difficult to trust, trust, trust

I'm feeling alive
I'm feeling alive, alive, alive
I'm feeling alive
I'm feeling alive, alive, alive

If you feel what I'm saying say
Oh, oh, oh, ohoho
Oh, oh, oh, ohoho
If you feel what I'm saying say
Oh, oh, oh, ohoho
Oh, oh, oh, ohoho
You might also likeI'm afraid if I try something crazy
I'mma end up in love, love, love

I learned to keep an open mind
I was holding up my blessings dog
Never know what you will come to find
Who knew that oil would come from the ground?
People only know what they choose their eyes to see
I know one thing that's for sure
It's some much more we can be

Don't be afraid to try something crazy
You might end up in love, love, love
'Cause the world that we live in is crazy
And we gotta learn to trust, trust, trust
