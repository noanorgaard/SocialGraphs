I'm running through the rubble
I'm getting into trouble
I gotta get the money flip it gotta make it double
Gotta chase a cheque gotta make some profit
Feeling like the prophet
With  my hand inside in my pocket
I gon rock it
U can't stop it
Turning nothing into something
Like some gossip
Promise
I gon blow up like a comet
Cinematic
My vision so panoramic
Smoking cannabis
I'm floating like Aladdin
So Deep in my thoughts i'm sinking in the Atlantic
Still breathing
I'm king of Atlantis
Check these waves
Niggas got u praying like a mantis
I got magic
Like houdini u gon vanish
No time to panic
I managed to save the planet
In a alternate universe
A nigga rapping verses in Spanish
I'm high as hell so please don't ask a nigga how he managed
You might also like(Chorus)
I got a bad feeling about it x4

(Verse:2)
I got my feet above the surface i'm living still got a purpose
Its me
Versus the universe since the day i was given birth
Born with a curse and i was worth it
Kept my hands dirty cuz i'm so down to earth and
The world spins
Its more sins
The devil got me cornered
Like a rodent
But i was chosen its the omen
Golden like i'm roman
Hit u with the Trojan
Leave you frozen like a snowman
I even out the odds do the math
Im no god
I'm a G just an odd one
Tryna Put me in a box niggas get outdone
Put me on a track you get outrun
Feeling like i'm Malcolm -
X dropped an album
From the grave and whats the outcome?
They say they only u love when you gone
And its wrong so i put in a song
So when i'm gone
I just hope u live a long
Cuz when i was... u didn’t bother call
(Chorus)
I got a bad feeling about it
