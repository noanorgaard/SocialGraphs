I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker

What you've done to me
Well I've seen many a friend be silenced
Thinking nobody would believe them
Well baby you've got another thing coming
You can try to make me stop, call it delusion
But every time I don't shut up, it's revolution

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon

Right now
It's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
I see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
But baby a bruise is, only your body
Tryna keep you intact
So right now
I think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
I think we should hop on the purple line
'Cause maybe our purpose
Is to never give up when we're on the right track

Meant the things you said
Turns out I had no idea
You'd ever tell me we were done
Or what that would feel like to hear

And you think that I'm beautiful

I think about the time
When I went down on you in the gallery
And I was always out of line
But I thought you were right there with me

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

All despite
