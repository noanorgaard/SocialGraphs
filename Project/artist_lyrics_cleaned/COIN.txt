Sleepless lonesome nights
Haunted by due time

Hope is dying for now
Haven't you heard?
Atlas folds at the thought
Of what he's just learned

A chain letter trap with one weak link
Maybe we should talk before I speak
Borrowed thoughts from a bitter end
Blame is ours and mine to

Bend it by the fault
Pompeii set us up

Before it gets worse

I let you down
I know it
I'll let you down over and over

I don't wanna dance
I don't know how
I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you

I don't wanna dance
I don't know how to dance with you

I don't, I don't know
I don't, I don't

Losing my cool
Over some accidental weekend
But honey I've got nothing to prove
And I know it seems cruel
You never call me on a Monday
Baby it's got nothing to do with you, no

I'll let you down over and over

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

You know my type
Tightrope across the table
Mmhmm, uh huh, I can't keep holding my breath
New wave, no time
Red velvet under pressure
Blah blah, green eyes
I never leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

Silence is golden, and you've got my hopes up

Something tells me
That you're never gonna stop 'til you get what you want
Don't you tell me that you never even thought
Maybe we could run, oh
Maybe we could run, oh
Maybe we could run

Pick a fight, set the house on fire
With bombs in your eyes
Well, the matter never seemed to make you afraid
Hit the ground running, Los Angeles
Find another naive arm to twist tonight
And if you're thinking that you'd like to quit
That's fine, you never wanted it anyway

Break my back just to make conversation
Pulling teeth just to ask how your day went
You’re disconnected
An inconsiderate mess
You've got me all to yourself

But are we alone?
Your eyes are staring vacantly
Oh, are you even listening at all?
There's no one here but you and me
So tell me, would you rather be alone?
Would you rather be alone?

I see you hiding
Behind a flickering screen
What did you come here for?
And then you light up
Who's keeping you company?
Don't wanna dance in the dark

Don't lie to me darling
Would you rather be alone?

It's a screen, it's a life
It's you, it's me
