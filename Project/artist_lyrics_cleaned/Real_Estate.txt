And I might as well be talking backwards
Am I making any sense to you?
And the only thing that really matters
Is the one thing I can't seem to do

When the night was over
And the field was lit up bright
And I walked home with you
Nothing I said came out right

And I might as well be talking backwards
Am I making any sense to you?
And the only thing that really matters
Is the one thing I can't seem to do

And I might as well be talking backwards

And the only thing that really matters
Is the one thing I can't seem to
Make sense of this dream

Impatiently, as I wait for you

The night surrenders swiftly
The moon retreats from sight
The darkness that surrounds me
The sun cuts like a knife to shine

Impatiently
Impatiently

The birds singing
The sun rising
Impatiently

As I wait for you
For you
For you
