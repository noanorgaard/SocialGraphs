I am not your Casanova
Me and Romeo ain't never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love ya
Gonna to say it to you time and time again

Oh Casanova

Every man deserves a good woman
And I want you to be my wife
Time is so much better spent baby
With a woman just like you in my life
So let me love you
Fill me up inside
I wanna hold you baby
So let me squeeze ya
Don't you know that i'll be on my knees for you baby
Oh baby

I am not your Casanova
Me and Romeo ain't never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love ya
Gonna to say it to you time and time again

Show you what you mean to me each day babe
Baby, baby, baby

I am not your Casanova
Me and Romeo ain't never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love ya
Gonna to say it to you time and time again

Oh Casanova
