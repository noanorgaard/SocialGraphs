I'm not into you
Anymore
I'm not into you
Anymore

No longer you that I'm falling for
I got my feelings up off the floor
I gave my best yea I gave my all
But now I no longer make that call
You might also 

From the moment you saw me I was your prey
You crept upon me got inside me more each day
Even though I never thought it would be this way
You wrapped around me, held me, made me wanna stay

And I should have known
Cause they warned me so
I can't let you go
Don't wanna let you know

You make me feel good
I stand like the king stood
And if I should feel loved, it's cause
You run through my blood
You make me feel good
I stand like the king stood
And if I should feel loved, it's cause
You make me feel good
You might also like
From the moment that you caught me unaware
You stood upon me, fooled me, made me think that you cared
Even though my mind is warning me despair
You got inside me, now there's something in the air



Take me to a place where we both don't have to face the things we face
There'll be nothin on my mind

I was told I'm not in control, but I'll sit and wait for it to unfold
Cause, when you're looking, you never find
All that you're looking for will find you blind

Take me to a place where we both don't have to face the things we face
There'll be nothing on my mindYou might also
