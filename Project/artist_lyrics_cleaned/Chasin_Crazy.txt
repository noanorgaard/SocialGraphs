Making ripples in the water baby don't ya think we oughta start, rubbing some lotion on our shoulders
Yeah it's gonna be a hot one, so drink em if ya got em…
Thats how we do summertime, lay back in the sunshine
Not a single worry on my mind a couple friends and feeling fine
That's how we do summertime
Dancin' and laughin' on the weekends
Every Friday night ya find us there, fire and a bunch of chairs
Baby there ain't no better feelin'
Knowing you got all you need, simple as a summer breeze
Thats how we do summertime, lay back in the sunshine
Not a single worry on my mind a couple friends and feeling fine
Thats how we do summertime
It's the simple pleasures in this life
Gotta grab them as they're drifting by
Thats how we do summertime, lay back in the sunshine
Not a single worry on my mind a couple friends and feeling fine
Thats how we do summertime, lay back in the sunshine
Not a single worry on my mind a couple friends and feeling fine
Thats how we do summertime
