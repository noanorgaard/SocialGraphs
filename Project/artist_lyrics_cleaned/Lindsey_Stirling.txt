Somebody shine a light
I'm frozen by the fear in me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me


Shatter me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

I wouldn't be so alone
We burn every magnet and spring
And spiral into the unknown
