Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

Never an honest word

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
