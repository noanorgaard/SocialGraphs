Say there is a fire in the dark when I close my eyes
And it's keeping me up at night and it's making me feel alive, ooh
I got a flashlight summoning up the stars
And it's showing them where we are
We'll be lighting up the dark
Oh oh oh flames
We hit it way too hard
We take it way too far
But it's a dying art
It's just the way we are
And I don't know what's the right way
To make them see that, see that
Cause in this maze, yeah, we're all flames, we're all flames

There's no fire if there's no flames
There's no fire if there's no flames
There's no fire if there's no flames
