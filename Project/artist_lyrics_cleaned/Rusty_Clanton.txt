I don't think I can take another sleepless night
If I just had another 20 minutes of darkness
I could finally rest my tired mind
Instead of wondering what everybody
Thinks of me and everything I do
It'd really help me out if you were through
Cat outside my window why won't you settle down?
I don't think I can take another brutal fight
There must be somewhere else you can make those awful sounds
And why do you wait until I lay down every night?
It's really less about the rest
And more about me feeling in control
Still, It'd really help me out if you could go
Oh wouldn't you think that by now
Someone my age should have these things figured out?
But I still depend on a few hours a night
To not over-think every dumb little thing in my life
Ooooooo
Oooooh Ahhhhhh

1 ContributorThat’s How It Goes LyricsThis is how it starts, with smart aleck remarks
You got me showin teeth, grinnin back at me
It's something in your walk
I know it ain’t your fault
When you took my breath away
The more I've got to say
The less I wanna talk
You listen to my songs and tell it like it comes
You make me wanna write so how could it be wrong?
You shake my heart right up
So how am I expected to stay away when I belong next to you
In highs and lowest lows, it's you and me
That’s how it goes
Yeah this is how it goes
I love you head to toes
It hasn't been a year. Always want you here
We got one for the books
I don't care how it looks
When you tell me I'm a catch, keep me comin back
Sinker, line, and hook
I'm never feelin stuck or watching where I step
Is this what they call love? I think I'll call it love
I'm back to where I started
You might also likeSo how am I expected to stay away when I belong next to you
In highs and lowest lows, it's you and me that’s how it goes
I don’t want to cause a scene, I don't want to cause a scene
I just want you to know exactly what I mean, just what I mean
When I say that I love you ’cause "I love you" won't mean what it's supposed to mean unless I got you close to me
So how am I expected to stay away when I belong next to you
In highs and lowest lows, it's you and me that’s how it 

I love how your heart beats
Whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me
Without being told to
Yeah I love the way your touch is always tenderly
But darling most of all
I love how you love me

I love how your eyes close
Each time you kiss me
And when I'm a way from you
I love how you miss me
Yeah I love the way your kiss is always heavenly
But most of all
I love how you love me
How you love meYou might also
