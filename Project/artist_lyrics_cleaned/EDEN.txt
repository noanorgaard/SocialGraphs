'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
But we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

And so I stand off like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart
Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, and, so I guess it's
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah
Woah, let die to let live

No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
