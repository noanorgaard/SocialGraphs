A while back I had to switch the name dog/
So if you ain't heard of banks well your late dog/
That's the only that's changed I'm still the same dog/
Its just the next episode call that Nate Dogg/
And I Dont give a damn about none of that hate/
Because its all handshakes when they up in my face/
Got a lot of cats that wish they was in my place/
But its my season now they got have to wait/
Its another reason for all they hearts to break/
Because they put they heart into it I made it palpitate/
Had to kill a couple dreams but man it that's the breaks/
Gonna kill a couple more I'll meet ya at the wake/
Too much to prove I live everyday like tomorrow my last/
(Woah now)
I am the dude to do what I do even if its to fast/
(slow down)
Fourth down, So when I come to your town/
Whether FSU or SoCal I'll Pepperdine on you Simonals/
Homecoming, parade thru my city like i just won/
Upset tummy when I show up, but that just means I'm the next up/
Heave ho dirty mind in these clean clothes/
I'm Hot as hell anti freeze yo but I cool ya down anti freeze though I'm mean joe/
Alfred Banks, that's my name please wear it out/
Fresh kicks pls wear em out oxygen I'm about to air em out/
Dont act saditty here's a tip so passionately/
I'll make her strip like magic city/
For all my royals like Kansas city live lavish with me/

Verse 2:
Nowadays I got a lot to lose/
I outwork anything in my opticles/
I Go against the grain my people fuck the rules/
So you Don't want none like a catholic school/
(New work) Like a student going back to school/
(Kool herc) I created what you rocking to/
(New shirt) So you Kno I gotta cop the shoes/
(Paydirt) because I'm really bouta drop some jewels/
First of all its the kid from the boot like doc martins/
Laxatives love to start shit/
Going hard thru the hardships/
Shining star on the starship/
Flame spitta nicks name is arson/
The governor was the one that charged me/
Im on death row I beg ya pardon/
Wordplay gotcha thirsty for my birthplace/
It's NO kinfolk we ain't want you here in the first place/
Betta back it up up yell cut if ya acting tough/
Y'all Long winded with the wackest stuff/
Safe sex better rap it up then rap it up/
They shyt so spotty/
Fuck with me you Know I got it/
This rapping stuff it ain't no hobby/
In the studio that's where you'll find me/
Getting cake like a birthday party/
Or rocking shows I'll rock yo party/
I'm the man go tell somebody/
That I'm the man better ask somebody/
Chorus: HomeComing x
