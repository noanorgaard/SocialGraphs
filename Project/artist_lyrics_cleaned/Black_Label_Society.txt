In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black

Withdrawn a step away just to find myself
The door is closed again, the only one left
This storm that's broken me, my only friend, yeah

In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, all shall fade to black
In this river, ain't no coming back
In this river, all shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
