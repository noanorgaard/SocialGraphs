Rich white girls
All I'm doing is wasting my time chasing rich white girls, yeah
All they do is bitch and they whine
So tell me what could I give you that your daddy can't give you?
Baby, what could I give, to a rich white girl?
They only love me when I pay 'em no mind

Your purses, your girlfriends, your love of hurting me
My new car, my new house, my insecurities
You kiss me as if it's a favor done for me, woah, uh
And dating a man like me is just a change in scenery
'Cause you never learned what it's like to treat someone decently

You're just a rich white girl

People talk too much shit in my face
'Round my back, on the phone
Ain't been famous for a while but I'm still up in my zone
And I don't usually smoke, but I'm high on sativa
There's mugwort in my tea, I smell like heaven, I'm a diva
Bangin' Aaliyah so loud in my speaker that I cannot hear you, no, I'm gone
Don't you be blowin' up my phone, I'm in a different time zone
Ever since a matter of time, all my girls is badder than nine
Hope to banish the debt
You hammered, you still don't know how to handle your wine
That's probably why you're hittin' me more
Yeah, I've got a rule 'cause I've done this before
Just fuck 'em three times and don't fuck 'em no more
'Cause they just fall in love if you fuck 'em the fourth
Don't get me wrong, I really like it when we're vibin'
But when I'm in another city, shh, be quiet

Switched whips, where wake, she saw it
This bitch on my ass, like a pair of my drawers
Any phone I ever own, she call it
She call me at 2, call me at 3
