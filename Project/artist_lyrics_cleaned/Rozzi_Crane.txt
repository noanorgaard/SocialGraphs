Yeah yeaaah
It's just that I still believe that I can find
Somebody who is strong like me
The kind of guy brave enough to face a fire
Without giving up
I want someone who can handle me
But you're half the man that I am
You're just a boy, boy
And I won't, I won't set off for half the man I am
Show me a man, one who can stand
As whole as I do, and be true
Love me like I do not half the man that I am!!
It's a losing game, and I don't wanna play
What's so hard about showing up when you say will
When love gets hard, you run away
We fall apart 'cause you're so afraid!
This love could set us on fire, so you just keep under your smooth
You're half the man that I am
You're just a boy, boy
And I won't, I won't set off for half the man I am
Show me a man, one who can stand
As whole as I do, and be true
Love me like I do, not half the man that I am!!
You might also likeBut it's so strange despite all the THINGS that you put me through
Still feel that pain of something like LOVE for you
Saddest part is that you still own my HEART!
But you are, you are only half the man, half the man that I am!
You're half the man that I am
You're just a boy, boy
And I won't, I won't set off for no half the man I am
Show me a man, one who can stand
As whole as I do, and be true
Love me like I do, not half the man that I
