I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, "You don't gotta be a victim"
Life ain’t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

Had a boogeyman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, "It's all your fault"
He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong"
