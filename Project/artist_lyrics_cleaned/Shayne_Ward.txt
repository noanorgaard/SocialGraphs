You got my attention at hello
We had this connection that wouldn't let go
There was something sexy about your voice
Anything you say makes a beautiful noise

Oh-oh
And now we break up to make up right away
(We make up right away)
Just an excuse to lay in bad all day
(Oh, we'll lay in bed all day)
I know that this thing we have won't ever change
(And that's why I have the confidence to say)

A lot of girls are sexy
But you know how to use it
You can keep me up on the phone all night
We say let's hang up on three
But we don't ever do it
Ain't it crazy how after all this time
We got that you hang up, no, you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up, no, you hang up kinda love

I still get the goosebumps I felt the first time
That I saw you walk in to a room
Girl, you had me hooked on that beautiful view

And now we break up to make up right away

Baby, you still know just how to blow my mind
And after everything that we've been through
It still feels right
(Girl and I) I know (That) I can't
Picture living my life without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
A lot of girls are sexy
But you know how to use it
