Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

My mama told me, "Boy, make good decisions"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real, I need a bih who gon' cooperate

I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
See my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine
None of this shit just fall from the sky
I'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired

Them people took my 40, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'

I told my mama we gon' be fine
So I'm up all night way after sleep time
I'm just thinkin' 'bout Lil Kuda, gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga behind
No daddy, so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I'ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin' all night, I'm going senile
With two niggas toting three four-fives
I seen a nigga play gangster, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I'm on XXL, I'm in New York now

I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

I keep thinkin' 'bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
Why we keep on falling victim?
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers, love my sister
Damn, I miss my lil' one
I know sometimes I be trippin'
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I'm too street for the industry
But I think that's where I need to be
'Cause verbally, mentally, and physically, I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smokin' one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But low-key, they be easin' me
You bitches don't mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin posted on the street, gon' call it Sesame
1K 'til the death of me, don't put your life in jeopardy
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard

I swear not a day goes by

Bleedin' concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissin' on nobody, B, I'm vibin' on the beat
Honestly, I'm just tryna be, I just gotta be
Tryin' to get over on anything, they tellin' lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't gettin' on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?

In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my socks
Find another route, and then I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

Fuck the FPL, bitch we buckin' all the power
I been doing well since I bumped into that power
Yeah them niggas straight, but ain't no nigga like a nigga from Broward
Running out of mollies so I laced her up with powder
Young nigga, I just wanna lay low and chill
Hoe don't call me Kodak thought I told you call me Bill
You know a nigga clutching got to keep that thang concealed
Nigga what's the point of doing it if you ain't gon do that shit for real?
Damn man, I thought Ian Rapport keep it real
Used to fuck with Carlo 'till he showed me what it is
