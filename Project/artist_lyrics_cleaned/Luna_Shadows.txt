Your tell-tale heart, baby, beating like a drum
Pounding out your chest, now repeating on the one
Tear the floorboards, baby, do it just for fun
'Cause you buried it once
Now you're digging it up
And going down with the sun

Who's gonna believe you?
One of these nights, somebody's gonna leave you
No one's gonna save you, save you
Come the full moon
Who's coming to the rescue?
What if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
No one's gonna save you, save you
When you cry wolf

There's a knock at your door
With the lights, with the lights out
Turn the lock, hit the floor
It's onto you, it's onto
You might also like
Your tell-tale heart, baby, beating like a drum
Pounding out your chest, now repeating on the one
Tear the floorboards, baby, do it just for fun
'Cause you buried it once
Now you're digging it up
And going down with the sun

Who's gonna believe you?
One of these nights, somebody's gonna leave you
No one's gonna save you, save you
Come the full moon
Who's coming to the rescue?
What if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
No one's gonna save you, save you
When you cry wolf, cry wolf
You cry wolf, you cry wolf

Tear the floorboards, baby
Digging it up
Tear the floorboards, baby
Do it just for fun
Tear the floorboards, baby
Digging it up, digging it up, digging it up
Who's gonna believe you?
One of these nights, somebody's gonna leave you
No one's gonna save you, save you
Come the full moon
Who's coming to the rescue?
What if tonight it's running, gonna get you?
No one's gonna save you, save you
When you cry wolf, cry wolf
You cry wolf, you cry wolf
No one's gonna save you, save
