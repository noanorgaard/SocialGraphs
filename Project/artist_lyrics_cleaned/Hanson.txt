The lights are on and I'm on an imaginary stage (up)
Even without high heels
Anywhere on the runway
You know I'm cool
Everybody knows
I opened my eyes
And posed like I wanted, babe

Wow, a bright light is shining on me
Nobody can stop us, no (Us no)
Wow, I feel alive
Feel so crazy now
This feeling
Ah, ah, ah, it's my way

My two toes rising to the top
A move without any harshness
Phones that get busy looking at me (Ah yeah)
Don't pay attention, set us free
I'm my own wannabe
I pose nicely like I'm the main character
You might also like
In this moment I feel alive
Not getting locked up in this evident frame
I stand up straight
I feel so high
It's the most freeing moment
Meet the real me, yeah

Pose, pose (Strike a pose)
Pose and pose, yeah!

Dance like there's nobody around (Ha)
Life is my only stage (Yeah, yeah)
Let's go, oh yeah
I'm crazy and I want to enjoy myself in my own way, babe

Wow, this new sensation
Even I am surprised
Nobody can stop us, no (Yeah, yeah, you can't stop us, no)
Wow, I feel alive
Feel so crazy now
This feeling
Ah, ah, ah, straight away
Two toes rising to the top
A move without any harshness
A pose where you don't know where you're going
Don't pay attention, set us free
I'm my own wannabe
I pose nicely like I'm the main character

In this moment I feel alive (I feel alive)
Not getting locked up in this evident frame
I stand up straight
I feel so high
It's the most freeing moment
Meet the real me, yeah

Everybody pose
Life's so (Ga-ga-ga-ga)
Get in position

The tip of my chin is way up high (Yeah, woo!)
I move without trembling (Huh)
A pose that no one would expect (Life's so)
My two toes rising to the top (Yeah)
A move without any harshness (Ooh, woo!)
A pose where you don't know where you're going (Life's so)

In this moment I feel alive (Ho-woo-oh)
Not getting locked up in this evident frame
I stand up straight
I feel so high (I feel so high)
It's the most freeing moment
Meet the real me, yeah
I feel alive (Ha-ah-ah)
Don't care about other people's stares (Ho-ooh)
Walk with your shoulders straightened
I feel so high (That's right, strike a pose, then go)
It's the most freeing moment
Meet the real me, yeah

Pose, pose
Pose,
