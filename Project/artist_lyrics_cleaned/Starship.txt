Oh, of course, they'll be totally discrete!

In your motel room

Good morning, I'm T. Rickster
Today, the entire central U.S. is alive with talk of incidents of supernatural activity
Alleged ghost sightings and other related paranormal occurrences have been reported across the Midwest
Well, everyone's heard ghost stories around the campfire
Ah, heck, I've even told a few stories of my own
But apparently, from eyewitness reports, these guys are actually saving people and hunting things!
*Riiiiing!*

*Ring, ring*
Is it an ordinary demon or does it have yellow eyes?

Stand aside, please

Hi, you're listening to Angel Radio
The phone-in topic today: the Winchester brothers
The controversy builds
More sightings have been reported
Some maintain these so-called professional hunters from Lebanon, Kansas are the cause of it all

I got it, I got it!
Dean? Dean?

Still making headlines all across the country, the Winchesters are at it again
This time at Blackwater Ridge
The boys slugged it out with a pretty pesky Wendigo
Then stuck around and enjoyed beers around the campfire with some lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance
This is T. Rickster, for Channel 7 news
I ain't afraid of no Squirrel
I hear he likes the pies
I ain't afraid of no Moose

Sam!
Dean!
Sam!
Dean!


Uh, if planes go down
Or there's a freaky clown, baby
You better call
(Winchesters!)
Oww!

*Growl*
Come in, Sam
Dean, I saw it, I saw it, I saw it!
It's right here, Sam
It's looking at me
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?
I think he can hear you, Sam
Don't move, it won't hurt you
Aaaahhhh! *Roar*
Dean! Dean!
Dean, what happened, are you okay?
Son of a bitch, he slimed me!
That's great, actual physical contact
Can you move?

Let me tell you somethin'
Huntin' makes me feel good
Huntin' makes me feel good
Huntin' makes me feel good
Yeah, huntin' makes me feel good
Oh, huntin' makes me feel good
Oh, carry on my wayward son

When Death is at your door
Unless you have a settled score
I think you better call
(Winchesters!)

Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)
Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)
I think ya better call
(Winchesters!)
Haha
Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)
I can't hear you!
Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)
Louder!
(Winchesters!)
Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)

(Winchesters!)

*Thunder*
Hey! Hillywood!
Get up!
Now, let's go kick some ass

Who ya gonna call?
(Winchesters!)

Do you believe in Wendigos, vengeful spirits, warding sigils, EMF meters, shapeshifters, demon-possession, telekinetic fairies, werewolves, vampires, Jefferson Starships, or the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?
Uhm, if there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you 

Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares? They're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the chokehold, oh
Then we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools

I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
