Wanted to take her back to my place
Driving 90, let the cops chase
Making that "Damn it feels so good" face
Cause she don't wanna wait, no, wait 'til we get home

Oh that girl, she want it, yeah she need it
She a bad mother, and I believe it

She says "Pull over and don't lock the doors"
She doesn't care who sees anymore
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)
It's better when it feels wrong
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh yeah, ooh-oh)

Six miles high up in the airspace
She says, "Come on to the back, baby"
Everybody knows just what's happening
But she don't give a shit, nah, she just want this OOH!!

1 Contributor10 Victoria’s Secret Models (Whethan Remix) Lyrics
Been on the L train in Chicago
Halloween day, you dress like Khaleesi
And some whiskey, said, "I don't drink, thanks"
Said "That's okay, I like your honesty"

I don't know where this train's going
Red line, red lights if it breaks down
I wouldn't care now

Even if 10 Victoria's Secret models
Walked in this room right now
I'd never take my eyes off you
I'd never take my eyes off you
And if I were 10 thousand miles
From this room right now
I'd never take my mind off you
I'd never take my mind off you

Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand...

I'd never take my eyes off you
I'd never take my eyes off...

I kissed you backstage, in Toronto
Three inches on me, with the heels on, but I don't care, baby
Had some herb on ya, said, "I don't smoke, thanks"
Maybe today I'll try it with you, babe

I don't know where this thing's going
Red lights, red lips in the pool house
I'll make a new vow

Even if 10 Victoria's Secret models
Walked in this room right now
I'd never take my eyes off you
I'd never take my eyes off you
And if I were 10 thousand miles
From this room right now
I'd never take my mind off you
I'd never take my mind off you

Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
(Right now, room, room, room)
Were 10 thousand miles
Ooh, you, never take my mind, ooh
Right now
Even if 10 Victoria's Secret models
Walked in this room right now
I'd never take my eyes off you

Time stops cold
Why would I ever waste my time with any other girls?
Why would I ever trust my secrets with somebody else?
With somebody else?
You make time stop cold
When you be looking at me like there ain't nobody else
And we can have this kind of room all to ourselves
I know I'll never take my eyes
