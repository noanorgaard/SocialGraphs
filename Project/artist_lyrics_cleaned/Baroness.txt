Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me, I needed a surprise

In a dream, a great calamity
To stone my heart and firm resolve
And render nerves to steel
The polestar wheeled about my head
Until such time it grew
A deep well of despair I found
The day my dreams came true

Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me

Shock me, I needed a surprise

What was the plan here? I can't seem to stop
Pissing and spitting from bottom to top
Picking up viscera, tendons, and broken remains

Did you find another way?
Was it my turn, or yours, to say
"Did you find another way"?

Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

I took your advice and the requisite pills
And forbidden pies from a white windowsill
Swallowing caveats, Baphomet's breath and migraines

Did I tell you, "Don't come home"?
Why was your mouth beginning to foam?
Did I tell you, "Don't come home"?

Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones
