See I was raised in the CMD streets
All my friends was runnin' through the rubber bands
It was rough growin' up in the East
We was broke but now we do the money dance
'Fore the iPhone I had a Tracfone
The Lil Wayne song was the ringtone
Can I tell you a lil' story from the heart one time

Got a seed on the way, tryna get low but

Couple niggas went fast, asked what hood he was from
Stood up, tried to run cause he knew what it was
3 shots in his back left his face in the mud
And I still remember when I got that call
Tears in my eyes bloody knuckles to the wall
But my homies outside told me "hop in the ride"
They got guns on they thighs (oh my)
Oh my, I spy with my little eye
Five niggas and they music on blast
All wearing flags so my niggas hit the gas
Fuckin' blood bath when the truck rolled past
Coolant in the street, dead bodies on the ave
Heart beatin' fast but my niggas just laughed
And we ran a red light, drove off in the night
And I ain't ever been so scared in my life
I remember it was...

And I been up fo' 3 nights in a row
Thinkin' 'bout them gold bullets out that passenger door
Down by the river and the hanky panky
My bro got shot by the bank-de-panky
And I damn near cried 'bout my homies outside
And everybody ducked when the truck rolled by
Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mothers won't see they sons no more
Gold bullet shells out the passenger door
I just looked at my nigga like "dawg, let me
