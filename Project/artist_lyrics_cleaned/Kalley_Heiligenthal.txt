I feel it in the wind, You're about to ride in
You said that You would pour Your Spirit out
And You said that You would fall on sons and daughters

So like the rain, come and drench us in love
And let Your glory rush in like a flood

And we are fixed on this one thing
To know Your goodness and see Your glory
Oh, we're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty
So I can see it now, Your kingdom come (all around us)
I can hear it now, the sounds of heaven
You said that if we ask, we'll receive
So we are asking for Your greater measure

So like the rain, come drench us in love
And let Your power rush in like a flood

Yeah, we are fixed on this one thing
To know Your goodness and see Your glory
Oh, we're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty

The time is now
The time is now

So come and blow on through
And Spirit move, we're ready for You
To come and blow on through
Oh come and do what only You can do
So come and blow on through
And Spirit move, we're ready for You
To come and blow on through
Oh, come and do, yeah, what only You can do
And we are fixed on this one thing
To know Your goodness and see Your glory
Oh, we're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty
