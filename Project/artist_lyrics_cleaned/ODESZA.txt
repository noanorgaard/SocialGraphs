I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I could be down on it
You could be all we need


I was thinking you and I could
Skip the part where we small talk each other
Turn the beat up, turn it real loud
Turn the beat up, turn it real loud
Hold me to my word this time
I'm gonna take another ride
Call me on my bitter side
Call me on my cell at night
Take it to the limit, babe
Don't ask me to commit a thing
If no one gets hurt, what was it worth
What was it worth, what was it worth

'Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner
With the Scarlet Letter
And while you're watching
You may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

I need a sign or a signal
I've overthought everything I can think of into symbol
I need the coat and your jacket
And the remnants of your cigarette packet

I wanna go, so, what'd you say
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

It's only water, it's only fire, it's only love
It's only slaughter, we're only liars, it's only blood
They're only thoughts that I'm having, thoughts safe within my head
You're only crying, you're only dying, you're only red

I heard the news today that you weren't mine to save
I hope that you're comfortable in the quiet lasting grave ()
What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf

It's only water, it's only fire, it's only love
It's only slaughter, we're only liars, it's only blood
They're only thoughts that I'm having, thoughts safe within my head
You're only crying, you're only dying, you're only dead

It's only water, it's only fire, it's only love
