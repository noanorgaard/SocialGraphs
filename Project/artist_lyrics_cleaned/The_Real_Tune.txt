It's off? I bet, I bet
Turn off the reverb too, we don't need that
Everything off? I bet, I bet
Ay ay
Focus on the wrong shit, always thinking about the past. It is what it is, that shit don't matter no more
I'm different, I don't got a pattern. Thinking about Saturn, thinking about that
Fuck. Leave the past, be a new me
Be a new me. Niggas thought they knew me, but they only knew the old me. Don't have a bitch to hold me
I can't change it. God help me. I can't help it. Drugs help me. And I feel hopeless, but shit
I know my potential, so I'ma keep going. Keep doing me. Keep doing me. Keep being me
Never change. Someday hop on a plane. Made some plans, and I'm planning on making it. My dream reality
I'ma be remembered for eternity. Numbers going crazy, it's cool to see. And my heart still cold like ice cream
Sadly my heart still broken, like glass. Yeah, leave the past. Leave that shit
Leave the past
Leave the past
Leave that shit
Leave the past
Fuck that shit. Fuck the past
This shit amazing. Niggas was just hating. All this love, I know niggas faking. Leaving the past, I'm going to different places
Playing my cards right
All aces

All y'all can't get clout. It's a shame. All y'all saying my name
Anyway, back to the topic. Leaving the past, I'm going back to the future. Got a cape, I'm feeling super
I'm a bird, no owl. But shout out Drake
Shout out OVO. My girl white like snow
She my baddest bitch, she know. I rap on that beat
I flow like a boat. All these drugs, I don't want no more
But fuck it, I'ma take one more
All y'all sleeping, all y'all snoring
But I'ma keep making some more. Music and shit on my own. Sneak dissing
I'll put you on the
