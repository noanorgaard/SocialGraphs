Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song while we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
