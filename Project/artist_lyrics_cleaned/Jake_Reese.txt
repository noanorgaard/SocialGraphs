1 ContributorDay To Feel Alive Lyrics
I've been a poor man and I've been a king
I've had my life and the world on a string
I've traveled many roads but I'm so far from done

I have been hopeless and I've had my faith
Some things I've lost and some things I have saved
All of these moments showed me the way that I've gone
Good to know, there's so much to live for

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, what a day to feel alive
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, what a day to feel alive

I've made some wrong turns, I've made some mistakes
I've broke some promises back in the day
But I've got a feeling I'm ready to leave it behind, oh
Good to know there's so much to live for
