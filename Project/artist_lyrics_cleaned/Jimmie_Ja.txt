Yeah
Mama I feel it, and I know you feel it too
Just pull up to the crib I’ve got a couple things we could do
We could slow it down to Jimmy Jam & Terry Lew
I could put you onto some shit that you ain’t never knew
And I know your type, the type that’s been hurt
The type of girl that ain’t been treated how she deserves
I can be the guy to treat you right and show you some worth
Show you how it feels to have somebody putting you first
Look baby I got you, no questions asked
We can light up and pour up until we crash
Don’t want you bringing up your ex’s and dirt from your past
Want you to focus on your future build some shit that last
But baby let me ask, what’s it gonna take to win you over
‘Cause it’s 10pm and I don’t feel likе being sober
When’s thе last time you let somebody come and hold ya

Grab a bottle take a sip ‘cause it feel right (right)
Spent the day, but I need you here all night (night)
Know you’re scared to love, but it’s alright, alright (right)
Can I meet you in the nighttime
Girl I know you know you wanna come out
Let your hair down, it’s been a while
Since you’ve met somebody real who made that body smile
I can tell you wanna trust and not be in denial
I know it may seem like I’m speaking from a lack of patience
But I can tell you feel the vibes, just from our conversations
It ain’t no rush but I’m just saying what we’ve both been thinking
When I’m in LA, you should come and kick it for the weekend
Yeah, yeah
Baby just slide through
I wanna gaze up at the stars the ones in your eyes too
The night is still young and this lovin’ is brand new
I’m always gon’ remember the moment I found you
You’ve got it going on, and I’ve been patiently waiting
As soon as you’re off work, go ahead and send your location
Let me pull up on you this loving is for the taking, we can’t escape it
Girl we’ve got to meet, in the nighttime (time, time)
Grab a bottle take a sip ‘cause it feel right (right)
Spent the day, but I need you here all night (night)
Know you’re scared to love, but it’s alright, alright (right)
Can I meet you in the nighttime
Grab a bottle take a sip ‘cause it feel right
Spent the day, but I need you here all night
Know you’re scared to love, but it’s alright, alright
Can I meet you in the

Make thief your heart like a bandit
Some dey hate our love, they can't stand it
But we go dey together cos we stand fit
