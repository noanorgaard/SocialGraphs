There's a demon in me
Telling me to believe
That you and I are more than just friends
There's an angel beside
Saying things just ain't right
But I'm not good at listening

You keep me up up
Keep me up all night
Who you think you are
Do this every time
You keep me up up
Just to bring me down
Look like a fool right now
Whenever I see you out
Hey you said that you would change
And you were gonna fix it
I say that talk is cheap
I'm going that's it
I'm staying up up
Staying up all night
Me myself and I
Staying up all night
All night...

Hmmm
Got your cards in my skin
And it doesn't make sense
But I love it when I feel the pain
Got your teeth sink ‘em in
What I'm fighting against
The part of me that loves the rain

There's a demon in me
Telling me to believe
That you and I are everything
There's an angel beside
Saying things just ain't right
But I'm not good at listening

You keep me up up
Keep me up all night
Who you think you are
Do this every time
You keep me up up
Just to bring me down
Look like a fool right now
Whenever I see you out
Hey you said that you would change
And you were gonna fix it
I say that talk is cheap
I'm going that's it
I'm staying up up
Staying up all night
Me myself and I
Staying up all night
All night...
You keep me up up
