When I grow up, I'll call you when I'm sober
You can take me for whatever that you want me to be
I'm addicted to all the time wasted
'Cause I'm scared of all the people that you have to believe, yeah
People that you had to believe, yeah
Flicker and fade, like the light behind your eyes
When you die, my words were such a lonely place
To hide, were you counting on my lies to help you
Sleep? Baby we were both sick all along

If I grow up I will tell you that it's over
You can hate me 'cause I'm everything you wanted to be
I'm too addicted to all the wrong places
'Cause I'm scared that there's nothing they will ever believe, yeah
The light behind your eyes will finally die, yeah
'Cause my words were such a lonely place to hide
Were you counting on my lies to help you lie, yeah?
To yourself, you can't be counting on yourself
You might also like
Do you love me 'cause I think I'm going under
I finally realised this is nothing that you wanted to see
You're a liar and I hate you for that so much
But I forgive you 'cause I really want to see you
