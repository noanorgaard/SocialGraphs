Oh, oh, I choose you, girl, yeah

Baby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World (World)
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl (Girl)
When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (Stalker) to walk a green mile (Mile)
We pilin' up the paper on the dinin' room table
'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable (Fable)
We rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
'Cause what's a ho with no pimp? And what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose
Oh, oh, I choose you, girl, yeah

Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick, or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cause it's gonna get wetter, better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't
Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it
Slaughter-slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eatin' good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just gettin' plump
'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up (Shit)

Oh, oh, I choose you, girl, yeah
Ah, I choose you,
