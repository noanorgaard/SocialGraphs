It's your boy Thundercat

Heavy-hearted, but my burden's light
I just wanna live, and learn how to fly
When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny
Kenny Loggins

Your heart is struggling, baby
Trying to believe
That there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you, babe
It’s all so easy?

Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they're worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

Ladies and gentlemen; Michael McDonald

Wake up and dream, tear down the wall
Of all you believe that might not be true
Long as love lies waiting there
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
Long as love lies waiting
They ain’t know our way, baby

Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they're worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride
Hey, how's it going? This is your boy Thundercat
If you're gonna fill your water bottle with vodka
Always make sure you have a friend with a bottle that actually has water in 

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh-ahh

Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you
Just to watch you throw it in the trash?
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess

That's when she said
"Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I'm down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way"
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more

At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes

From my eyewitness binoculars (Uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (Uh-huh)
We mastered the (What?) pressure (Yeah)
Hazardous (Uh-huh), harassing us (That's right)
You laugh at us (You did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Body bags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin, be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
I bitched while we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, Percocets
And for all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'fore we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone comin' can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wasn't coming home from the pen, but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by
