So many reasons for you and I
To go and leave one another behind
I do not want it like that, like that
All of the times that you fucked my head
Go on and do that with another instead
Cause I do not want it like that, like that

I was your treasure, treasure, treasure
I was your treasure
I was your treasure, treasure, treasure
I was your treasure

Late in the night, you wonder what I’m hiding
Calling me out, you’re drunk I’m tired fighting
Silent treatment, my heart’s beating
Is all we had now lost?
Yeah you know it, yeah you know it

I was your treasure, treasure, treasure

I don’t even bother anymore
But say something, say something, say something
We can’t get along like this no more
Just say something, say something

On and on and on it goes
On and on and on it goes

'Cause I've been nothing but good to you
Your howling into the night won't do
I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you

Every moment my heart went black and cold
Nothing stings as much like never knowing
What you've been up to, whose bed you're crashing now
I wanna get rid of the feeling, turn it all around

Get out the door and disappear
When you get home I won't be here
Don't act surprised as if you cared
Don't even bother, 'cause

Can't get along, can't be alone
Where's your mind at?
Are you on your own?
You're falling out, I'm falling back
Where's your heart at?
Don't you feel alone?

Tell me would you give us one more try?
'Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Heavy-hearted, trouble on my mind
'Cause I, I think about, I think about you

Your words, they burn
I read it twice, the way you write is different
You're cold, and it's cruel
Acting like I am someone that you never knew

I've tried, but a heart don't lie
Don't you remember?
'Cause I remember

I've tried, but a heart don't lie
Don't you remember?
