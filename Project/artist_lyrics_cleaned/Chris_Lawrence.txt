the senator dressed like an austrian
sheep, stopping in for coffee & insulting
the lawyer/ he is on a prune diet &
secretly wishes he was bing crosby
but would settle for being a close
relative of edgar bergen
passing the sugar to iron man of the bottles who arrives with a grin & a heatlamp & he's pushing "who dunnit" buttons this year & he is a love monger at first sight . . . you have seen him sprout up from a dumb hill bully into a bunch of backslap & he's wise & he speaks to everyone as if they just answered the door/ he dont like people that say he comes from the monkeys but nevertheless he is dull & he is destroyingly boring . . . while Allah the cook scrapes hunger from his floor & pounding it into the floating dishes with roaring & the rest of the meatheads praising each other's power & argue over acne & recite calendars & pointing to each other's garments & liquid & disperse into segments & die crazy deaths & bellowing farce mortal farm vomit & why for Jesus Christ be Just another meathead? when all the tontos & heyboy lose their legs trying to frug while kemosabe & mr palladin spend their off hours remaining separate but equal & anyway why not wait for laughter to straighten the works out meantime & WOWEE smash & the rage of it all when former lover cowboy hanging upside down & Suzy Q. the angel putting new dime into this adoption machine as out squirts a symbol squawking & freezing & crashing into the bowels of some hideous soap box & even tho youre belonging to no political party, youre now prepared, prepared to remember something about something

the chief of police holding a bazooka
with his name engraved on it. coming in
drunk & putting the barrel into the face
of the lawyer's pig. once a wife beater,
he became a professional boxer & received
a club foot/ he would literally like to
become an executioner. what he doesnt know
is that the lawyer's pig has made friends
with the senator

gambler's passion & his slave, the sparrow & he's ranting from a box of platform & mesmerizing this ball of daredevils to stay in the morning & dont bust from the factories/ everyone expecting to be born with whom they love & theyre not & theyve been let down, theyve been lied to & now the organizers must bring the oxen in & dragging leaflets & gangrene enthusiasm, ratfinks & suicide tanks from the pay phones to the housing developments & it usually starts to rain for a while . . . little boys cannot go out & play & new men in bulldozers come in every hour delivering groceries & care packages being sent from las vegas . . . & nephews of the coffee bean expert & other favorite sons graduating with a pompadour & cum laude - praise be & a wailing farewell to releasing the hermit & beautifully ugly & fingering eternity come down & save your lambs & butchers & strike the roses with its rightful patsy odor . . . & grampa scarecrow's got the tiny little wren & see for yourself while saving him too/ look down oh great Romantic. you who can predict from every position, you who know that everybody's not a Job or a Nero nor a J. C. Penny . . . look down & seize your gambler's passion, make high wire experts into heroes, presidents into con men, turn the eventual . . . but the hermits being not talking & lower class or insane or in prison . . . & they dont work in the factories anyway

the good samaritan coming in with the
words "round & round we go" tattooed on
his cheek/ he tells the senator to stop
insulting the lawyer/ he would like to
be an entertainer & brags that he is
one of the best strangers around, the
pig jumps on him & starts eating his
face
illiterate coins of two head wrestling with window washer who's been reincarnated from a garden hoe & after once being pushed around happily & casually hitting a rock once in a while is now bitter hung up on finding some inferior. he bites into the window ledge & by singing "what'll we do with the baby-o" to thirsty peasant girl wanting a drink from his pail, he is thinking he is some kind of success but he's getting his kicks telling one of the two headed coins that tom jefferson used to use him around the house when the bad stuff was growing . . . the lawrence welk people inside the window, theyre running the city planning division & they hibernate & feeding their summers by conversing with poor people's shadows & other ambulance drivers, & they dont even notice this window washer while the families who tell of the boogey men & theyre precious & there's pictures of them playing golf & getting blacker & they wear oil in the window washer's union hall & these people consider themselves gourmets for not attending charlie starkweather's funeral ye gads the champagne being appropriate pagan & the buffalo, tho the restaurant owners are vague about it, is fast disappearing into violence/ soon there will be but one side of the coin & mohammed wherever he comes from, cursing & windows washers falling & then no one will have any money . . . broad save the clean, the minorities & liberace's countryside.

the truck driver coming in with a carpet
sweeper under his eyes/ everybody says
"hi joe" & he says "joe the fellow that
owns this place i'm just a scientist. i
aint got no name" the track driver hates
anybody that carries a tennis racket/ he
drinks all the senator's coffee & proceeds
to put him in a headlock

Lem the Clam tho, he really gives a damn if dale really does get nailed slamming down the scotch & then going outside with Maurice, who aint the Peoria Kid & dont look the same way as they do in Des Moines, Iowa & good old debbie, she comes along & both her & dale, they start shacking up in the newspapers & jesus who can blame 'em & Amen & oh lordy, & how the parades dont need your money baby . . . it's the confetti & one george washington & Nadine who comes running & says where's Gus? & she's salty about the bread he's been making off her worms while dollars becoming pieces of paper . . . but people kill for paper & anyway you cant buy a thrill with a dollar as long as pricetags, the end of the means & only as big as your fist & they dangle from a pot of golden rainbow . . . which attacks & which covers the saddles of noseless poets & wonder blazing & somewhere over the rainbow & blinding my married lover into the ovation maniacs/cremating innocent child into scrapheap for vicious controversy & screwball & who's to tell charlie to stop & not come back for garbage men arent serious & they gonna get murdered tomorrow & next march 7th by the same kids & their fathers & their uncles & all the rest of these people that would make leadbelly a pet . . . they will always kill garbage men & wiping the smells but this rainbow, she goes off behind a pillar & sometimes a tornado destroys the drugstores & the floods bring polio & leaving Gus & Peg twisted in the volleyball net & Butch hiding in madison square garden . . . Bearface dead from a flying piece of grass! I.Q. - somewhere in the sixties & twentieth century & so sing aretha . . . sing mainstream into orbit! sing the cowbells home! sing misty . . . sing for the barber & when your found guilty of not owning a cavalry & not helping the dancer with laryngitis . . . misleading valentino's pirates to the indians or perhaps not lending a hand to the deaf pacifist in his sailor jail . . . it then must be time for you to rest & learn new songs . . . forgiving nothing for you have done nothing & make love to noble scrubwoman
