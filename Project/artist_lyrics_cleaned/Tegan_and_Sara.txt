You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

In a minute, I'll be hoping that you're outside
Another second, you'll be walking on my wild side
You know I'm ready for anything to happen
Take this passion, turn it into action

Right where I want you, back against the wall
Trust when I promise, never let you fall
Right where I want you, back against the wall
You can trust me, I'll never let you fall

Tonight, if you fuel my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

It’s not just all physical
I’m the type who won't get oh so critical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical

All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me
Here comes the heat before we meet
A little bit closer
Here comes the spark before the dark
Come a little closer

Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, erring on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Spelled out your name
And list the reasons, faint of heart, don't call me back
I imagine you when I was distant, not insistent
I follow suit and laid out on my back
Imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that
