Won't you 
Believe  in this lie with us all
Leave you in the dark

Now my body's on the floor and I am calling
Well I'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?

Well it's not a rebellion
When you're selling out to another fashion salesman
Our promising lives are full of empty promises
Temptation's falling and calling you home again
Well I'm sorry if we've let you down

Cute lil' mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair
Down her back like mine

Man she ain't never
Had a love like mine
But Man, I ain't never
Seen an ass like hers

Had me loss for words
Told her to back it up
Like berp berp
And I made that ass jump
Like jerp jerp
And that's when she
She licked me like a lollipop
Like a lollipop
