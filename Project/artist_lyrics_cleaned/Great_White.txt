For every single broken bone I ever suffered
For every cutthroat cunt and gutless motherfucker
Want to kick me when I'm down
Want to stomp my head into the ground
You won't knock me off my two feet
I'm fuckin' built like an animal
Bad to the bone since the day I was born, yeah
But I've got miles and miles
To go before I sleep
My nose is bleeding, head is spinning
I can't fuckin' help from grinning
Have I lost or am I winning?
Let's settle the score
You might also like
What are you looking for?
Well, Angel-baby I don't know anymore
I have the story in my head
The pen and paper in my hand
I cannot seem to see this through from the beginning to the end
I suffer writers block and blurry vision
As fact begins to blend in with fiction
It's hard to tell the difference when my subconscious
Cleverly manifests itself into characters such as these

I'm a gypsy rebel fighter and I haven't got a soul
I've got a pocket full of demons and my fists are made of stone
I've got the teeth of a great white
And I've worked up quite an appetite
For all that mince-meat in between that vertebrae you call a spine
I throw a mean left hook that could stop a fuckin' truck
And I've got seven deadly reasons why you shouldn't push your luck
Cause on my Colors album I showed you the flags that I was flying
But if you listen close enough you could see that I was trying to say

On the day I was born they say the heavens wept
Cause I was born with a crown of thorns on my head
And the hearts of a million men in my chest
I'm unstoppable
Two fingers up and singing, "Fuck the world"
Oh yeah, I got my eye on you girl
And if I can't have you, nobody will
One, two, three, four

Now let me show you where the fuck I'm coming from

I'm twenty-two years old and what the fuck do I got to show
I've got the skin on my muscles and the muscles on my bones
My bones encase my heart, my heart protects my soul
So tell me what the fuck he's got that I don't
Aside from the slit throat, and the broken neck
You're gonna get if you don't start showing me some fucking respect, boy

Keep it together now
Deep breath, deep breath

Fuck him
And fuck her
And fuck you too
Fuck what you say when it ain't what you do
I've served my penance and I've paid my dues
Not to suffer motherfuckers and the likes of you
I'm gonna break, and when I do
I know that I'll just blame you
But the truth is that I
Am just so sick of my fucking life, I want to die
You see I gave her my heart but she gave it back
So I took my little baby and I put her in a bag
Then I stomped her fuckin' head until it blended with the floor
You'd be surprised how many people shed a tear for a whore like you
And at the funeral I was tearin' up the dance floor
Cause they were playing my favorite song
All night long
To my surprise, it was an open-casket
But the body in the coffin was mine
You see I knew right then this was the fuckin' end
I'd clearly lost my fuckin' mind

And the Desperado knew right then
That true love just ain't in the cards for men like him
It's a long and lonely road we walk
But someone's gotta do it
(Remember who you are)

Well, Angel-baby I don't know anymore
I have the story in my head
The pen and paper in my hand
I cannot seem to see this through from the beginning to the end
I suffer writers block and blurry vision
As fact begins to blend in with fiction
It's hard to tell the difference when my subconscious
Cleverly manifests itself into characters such as these

Batter up, batter up, batter on deck
Take the blunt of this bat to the back of her head
Three swings three strikes, if by chance she dies
First place prize is called self respect
You see a whore is nothing more than a gutter with a face
The apex of her ethics can be found between her legs
So I don't hesitate, no contemplate to send the bitch to hell
You think I really give a flying fuck about a jail cell? (Hell naw)
My whole life is a prison (Prison)
Yeah I'm alive but that don't mean that I'm living
In my chest lies a nest infested with war-monger maggots
And the man in the mirror is a self-destructing faggot
I ain't fuckin' around this ain't a god damn joke
If I don't get this shit out I think I'm gonna fuckin choke
Everybody claims to be hard but they've never felt real pain
You see, baby, real's my middle
