We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want

It took a little time to make a little better
It's only going up, just one thing then another

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have attained, why try anything?
I will get there, just remember, I know

Drawn apart, New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder, will you wait for me?

Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?

I built a hive, became one with the bees
But we fell like rain, got lost into the sea
If I don't know, the wind will carry me
So just hold tight

Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist, I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you

In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore

The door is open, you whispered to me
As you stood frozen in deep uncertainty
I hope that you know what I am thinking
Before you go with your heart sinking

And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore, anymore
Anymore

Now, now you're digging a wreck
What will you write about?
How did you find that out?
You get paid and don't need any respect
Senses fading
She's no lady

Oh, we've made a mistake
We've lost our minds
We've lost our memory
Oh, what's it gonna take?
There's always something else
Waiting on the shelf

You could be president
You never paid the rent but I don't mind
You got no reason to learn what came first
It can't be good enough, good enough

I saw the world today
It comes in green and gray
Refrigerator hum
And chewing gum and instant karma
The war's a whore
