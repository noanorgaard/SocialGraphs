You, you hear it too, you hear the music?
(vocalizing)

Now sing
Sing, sing for me!

Have you ever yearned to go
Past the world you think you know?
Been enthralled to the call
Of the beauty underneath?
Have you let it draw you in
Past the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
Of the beauty underneath?
Can you taste it?
Have you heard its music and embraced it?
Do you crave the visions that have chose you?
Do you wonder why it chose you?
You might also likeLike it knows you
Knows you have a darkness running through you
If you're not afraid, I'll show it to you

You don't fear the darkness, do you?

Have you found yourself beguiled
By the dangerous and wild
And been hooked as you looked
At the beauty underneath?
Have you felt your senses surge
And surrender to the urge
Tell me you know it too
Know the beauty underneath
If it's in you
In your skin, and bone, and blood, and sinew
If it doesn't frighten you and shake you
There are places I can take you

I can taste it
I have heard the music and embraced it
Even in the wonders that you've showed me
It's as if he's always known me
It seems so beautiful
So strange yet beautiful
Everything's just as you said

And he's so beautiful
Perhaps too beautiful
What I suspect cannot be
Still he seems so much like me
I can't look away

Can you taste it?
You have seen the darkest and embraced it
Don't you crave the visions that have chose you?
Don't you wish that it had chose you?

Why he knows us?
Knows our skin, and bone, and blood, it's in you

Knows the things I recognized within you
Are you willing to continue?
But it knows you
Knows your skin, and bone, and blood, and sinew
Knows you have no beauty deep within you
Knows the madness can continue

And you're ready

Yes

Come closer

Yes

You've no fear of the beauty underneath
You can face it

Yes

You can take it

Yes

You see through to the beauty underneath
To the splendor

To the splendor

And the glory

And the glory

To the truth of the beauty underneath

The beauty underneath

You'll accept it

Yes

You'll embrace it

Yes

Let me show you the beauty underneath
To the splendor

To the splendor

And the glory

And the glory

To the truth of the beauty underneath

The beauty underneath

You'll accept it
