2 INT.
BARRACKS--DAY
Marine recruits stand at attention in front of their bunks.
Master Gunnery Sergeant HARTMAN walks along the line of blank-faced recruits.
HARTMAN: I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your Senior Drill Instructor. From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "Sir!" Do you maggots understand that?

RECRUITS (in unison): Sir, yes, sir!

HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you. Sound off like you
got a pair.
RECRUITS (louder): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training ... you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of death, praying for war. But until that day you are pukes! You're the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings! You are nothing but unorganized grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit!
Because I am hard, you will not like me. But the more you hate me, the more you will learn. I am hard, but I am fair! There is no racial bigotry here! I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally worthless! And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps! Do you maggots understand that?
RECRUITS (in unison): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you!
RECRUITS (louder): Sir, yes, sir!

HARTMAN: What's your name, scumbag?
SNOWBALL (shouting): Sir, Private Brown, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! From now on you're Private Snowball! Do you like that name?
SNOWBALL (shouting): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well, there's one thing that you won't like, Private Snowball! They don't serve fried chicken and watermelon on a daily basis in my mess hall!
SNOWBALL: Sir, yes, sir!
JOKER (whispering): Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
HARTMAN: Who said that? Who the fuck said that? Who's the slimy little commode of shit twinkle-toed cocksucker down here, who just
signed his own death warrant? Nobody, huh?! The fairy fucking godmother said it! Out-fucking-standing! I will P.T. you all until you fucking die! I'll P.T. you until your assholes are sucking buttermilk.

HARTMAN: Was it you, you scroungy little fuck, huh?!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: You little piece of shit! You look like a fucking worm! I'll bet it was you!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
JOKER: Sir, I said it, sir!

HARTMAN: Well ...no shit. What have we got here, a fucking comedian? Private Joker? I admire your honesty. Hell, I like you. You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.
Sergeant HARTMAN punches JOKER in the stomach. JOKER sags to his knees.
HARTMAN: You little scumbag! I've got your name! I've got your ass! You will not laugh! You will not cry! You will learn by the numbers. I will teach you. Now get up! Get on your feet! You had best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Private Joker, why did you join my beloved Corps?
JOKER: Sir, to kill, sir!
HARTMAN: So you're a killer!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Let me see your war face!
JOKER: Sir?
HARTMAN: You've got a war face? Aaaaaaaagh! That's a war face. Now let me see your war face!
JOKER: Aaaaaaaagh!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! You didn't convince me! Let me see your real war face!
JOKER: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
HARTMAN: You didn't scare me! Work on it!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
Sergeant HARTMAN speaks into cowboy's face.
HARTMAN: What's your excuse?
COWBOY: Sir, excuse for what, sir?
HARTMAN: I'm asking the fucking questions here, Private. Do you understand?!
COWBOY: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well thank you very much! Can I be in charge for a while?
COWBOY: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you shook up? Are you nervous?
COWBOY: Sir, I am, sir!
HARTMAN: Do I make you nervous?
COWBOY: Sir!
HARTMAN: Sir, what? Were you about to call me an asshole?!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: How tall are you, Private?
COWBOY: Sir, five foot nine, sir!
HARTMAN: Five foot nine? I didn't know they stacked shit that high! You trying to squeeze an inch in on me somewhere, huh?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir.
HARTMAN: Bullshit! It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress! I think you've been cheated!
HARTMAN: Where in hell are you from anyway, Private?
COWBOY: Sir, Texas, sir!
HARTMAN: Holy dogshit! Texas! Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy! And you don't look much like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down! Do you suck dicks?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you a peter-puffer?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddam common courtesy to give him a reach-around! I'll be watching you!

HARTMAN: Did your parents have any children that lived?
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: I'll bet they regret that! You're so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece! What's your name, fatbody?
PYLE: Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!
HARTMAN: Lawrence? Lawrence, what, of Arabia?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: That name sounds like royalty! Are you royalty?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Do you suck dicks?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I'll bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose!
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: I don't like the name Lawrence! Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence! From now on you're Gomer Pyle!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
PYLE has the trace of a strange smile on his face.
HARTMAN: Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle? Do you think I'm funny?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Then wipe that disgusting grin off your face!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!
PYLE: Sir, I'm trying, sir.
HARTMAN: Private Pyle, I'm gonna give you three seconds--exactly three fucking seconds--to wipe that stupid-looking grin off your face, or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you! One! Two! Three!

PYLE: Sir, I can't help it, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! Get on your knees, scumbag!

HARTMAN: Now choke yourself!

HARTMAN: Goddamn it, with my hand, numbnuts!!

HARTMAN: Don't pull my fucking hand over there! I said choke yourself! Now lean forward and choke yourself!



HARTMAN: Are you through grinning?
PYLE (barely able to speak): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you!
PYLE (gasping): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I still can't hear you! Sound off like you got a pair!
PYLE (gagging): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: That's enough! Get on your feet!

HARTMAN: Private Pyle, you had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links... or I will definitely fuck you up!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!

Prepare to mount! Mount!

HARTMAN: Port... hut!

HARTMAN: Pray!
RECRUITS (in unison): This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it, as I must master my life. Without me my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviours of my life. So be it... until there is no enemy but peace. Amen.

HARTMAN: The deadliest weapon in the world is a marine and his rifle. It is your killer instinct which must be harnessed if you expect to survive in combat. Your rifle is only a tool. It is a hard heart that kills. If your killer instincts are not clean and strong you will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill. You will become dead marines.

INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
The recruits in their skivvies stand at attention in two facing rows on top of their footlockers, arms outstretched, hands held rigidly in front of them, palms down, for inspection.
HARTMAN moves along the row of men. He smacks a recruit's hand.
HARTMAN: Trim 'em.
HARTMAN points at the feet of another recruit.
HARTMAN: Toejam!
To another recruit.
HARTMAN: Pop that blister!
HARTMAN stops in front of PYLE and notices his foot-locker is unlocked. He picks up the lock and holds it up to PYLE.
HARTMAN: Jesus H. Christ! Private Pyle, why is your footlocker unlocked?
PYLE: Sir, I don't know, sir!
HARTMAN: Private Pyle, if there is one thing in this world that I hate, it is an unlocked footlocker! You know that, don't you?
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: If it wasn't for dickheads like you, there wouldn't be any thievery in this world, would there?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Get down!
PYLE steps down, from the footlocker. HARTMAN flips open the lid with a bang and begins rummaging through the box.
HARTMAN: Well, now .. . let's just see if there's anything missing!
HARTMAN freezes. He reaches down and slowly picks up a jelly doughnut, holding it in disgust at arm's length with his fingertips.
HARTMAN: Holy Jesus! What is that? What is that, Private Pyle?!
PYLE: Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!
HARTMAN: A jelly doughnut?!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: How did it get here?
PYLE: Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir!
HARTMAN: Is chow allowed in the barracks, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: And why not, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!
HARTMAN: Because you are a disgusting fatbody, Private Pyle!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut in your footlocker, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, because I was hungry, sir!
HARTMAN: Because you were hungry?
Holding out the jelly doughnut, HARTMAN walks down the row of recruits
still standing with their arms outstretched.
HARTMAN: Private Pyle has dishonored himself and dishonored the platoon! I have tried to help him, but I have failed! I have failed because you have not helped me! You people have not given Private Pyle the proper motivation! So, from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up, I will not punish him, I will punish all of you! And the way I see it, ladies, you owe me for one jelly doughnut! Now, get on your faces!
HARTMAN (to PYLE): Open your mouth!
He shoves the jelly doughnut into PYLE's mouth.
HARTMAN: They're paying for it, you eat it!
HARTMAN turns to the recruits.
HARTMAN: Ready . . . exercise!
The platoon does push-ups.
RECRUITS (chanting in cadence)

32 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
We see a towel on a bed. A bar of soap is tossed on the towel. The towel is folded over the soap forming a weapon. A hand picks up the towel-weapon and bangs it on the mattress making a dull thud.
PYLE is asleep in his bunk. The platoon silently slip out of their beds and form up around PYLE. A blanket is thrown over PYLE, each corner held down by a recruit, pinning PYLE to the bed. COWBOY shoves a gag in PYLE's mouth. PYLE is helpless. The platoon files past beating PYLE with the bars of soap wrapped in towels. PYLE's screams are muffled by the gag.
JOKER is the last one. He stands back from the bed.
COWBOY (to JOKER): Do it! Do it!

COWBOY (removing gag): Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

HARTMAN: None of you dumbasses knows?

HARTMAN: Private Cowboy?

HARTMAN: That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed twenty people from a twenty-eight-story observation tower at the University of Texas from distances up to four hundred yards.

HARTMAN: Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

HARTMAN: Private Snowball?
SNOWBALL: Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!
HARTMAN: That's right, and do you know how far away he was?
SNOWBALL: Sir, it was pretty far! From that book suppository building, sir!

HARTMAN: All right, knock it off! Two hundred and fifty feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got off three rounds with an old Italian bolt action rifle in only six seconds and scored two hits, including a head shot! Do any of you people know where these individuals learned to shoot?

HARTMAN: Private Joker?
JOKER: Sir, in the Marines, sir!
HARTMAN: In the Marines! Outstanding! Those individuals showed what one motivated marine and his rifle can do! And before you ladies leave my island, you will be able to do the same thing!

35 INT. BARRACKS--DAY
Recruits standing at attention in two facing rows. HARTMAN walks between the rows, leading them in song.
HARTMAN & RECRUITS: Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday, dear Jesus, Happy Birthday to you!
HARTMAN: Today ... is Christmas! There will be a magic show at zero-nine-thirty! Chaplain Charlie will tell you about how the free world will conquer Communism with the aid of God and a few marines! God has a hard-on for marines because we kill everything we see! He plays His games, we play ours! To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep heaven packed with fresh souls! God was here before the Marine Corps! So you can give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps! Do you ladies understand?

HARTMAN: I can't hear you!
RECRUITS: Sir, yes, sir!

A few recruits, including PYLE, are mopping the floor.
38 INT. LATRINE--NIGHT
In the latrine COWBOY and JOKER are also mopping the floor.
JOKER stops, looks around to be sure they are alone, and turns to COWBOY.
JOKER: Leonard talks to his rifle.
COWBOY keeps mopping.
COWBOY: Yeah!
JOKER: I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore. I think Leonard's a Section Eight.
Pause.
COWBOY: It don't surprise me.
They both go back to mopping.
JOKER speaks again after some silence.
JOKER: I want to slip my tubesteak into your sister. What'll you take in trade?
COWBOY: What have you got?
39 EXT. FIRING RANGE--DAY
HARTMAN kneels behind PYLE, looking on with approval.
PYLE finishes a good group and reloads his M-14.
HARTMAN: Outstanding, Private Pyle! I think we've finally found something that you do well!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
40 EXT. PARADE DECK--DAY
HARTMAN inspects the recruits.
HARTMAN (to JOKER): What's your sixth General Order?
JOKER: Sir, the private's sixth general order is to receive and obey and to pass on to the sentry whorelieves me ... all orders ... Sir, the
private's sixth ... Sir, the private has been instructed but he does not know, sir!
HARTMAN: You slimy scumbag, get on your face and give me twenty-five!
JOKER: Sir, aye-aye, sir!
HARTMAN walks to PYLE.
HARTMAN: How many counts in that movement you've just executed?
PYLE: Sir, four counts, sir!
HARTMAN: What's the idea of looking down in the chamber?
PYLE: Sir, that is the guarantee that the private is not giving the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir!
HARTMAN: What's your fifth general order?
PYLE: Sir, the private's fifth general order is to quit my post only when properly relieved, sir!
HARTMAN: What's this weapon's name, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, the private's weapon's name is Charlene,
HARTMAN: Private Pyle, you are definitely born again hard! Hell, I may even allow you to serve as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!

DISSOLVE TO:

42 EXT. FOREST--DAY
Woods. For the
first time the platoon marches in
full combat gear carrying rifles.

JOKER
(narration)
Graduation is only a few days away and
the
recruits of platoon thirty-ninety-two are salty.
They are
ready to eat their own guts and ask
for seconds.

43 EXT.
FIELD--DAY
In full combat gear and with fixed bayonets, the
recruits
charge through green smoke.
JOKER
(narration)
The drill instructors are proud to see that we
are growing beyond
their control. The Marine
Corps does not want robots. The Marine
Corps wants killers. The Marine Corps wants
to build indestructible
men, men without fear.

44 INT. BARRACKS--DAY
HARTMAN talks to the
recruits formed up in a
school-circle.
HARTMAN
Today
you people are no longer maggots.
Today you are marines. You're part
of a
brotherhood.

45 EXT. PARADE GROUND--DAY
Graduation. A
marching band. Spectators.
Hundreds of marines parade by in dress
uniform.
HARTMAN
(voice over)
From now on,
until the day you die, wherever
you are, every marine is your
brother. Most of
you will go to Vietnam. Some of you will not
come back. But always remember this:
marines die, that's what we're
here for! But
the Marine Corps lives forever. And that
means
you live forever!
DISSOLVE TO:

JOKER
Sir, yes, sir!

HARTMAN
Forty-two-twelve, Basic Military Journalism.
You gotta
be shitting me, Joker! You think
you're Mickey Spillane? Do you
think you're
some kind of fucking writer?
JOKER
Sir, I wrote for my high school newspaper, sir!
HARTMAN
Jesus H. Christ, you're not a writer, you're
a killer!

JOKER
A killer, yes, sir!
HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!

PYLE doesn't answer.
HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!
We see PYLE
in close-up, now completely with-
drawn, barely able to answer HARTMAN.

PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN
You forget your
fucking name? O-three-
hundred, Infantry. You made it. Perkins!

PERKINS
Sir, yes, sir!

47 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
The platoon
sleeps. JOKER walks slowly down the
squad bay with a flashlight.

JOKER
(Itarration)
Our last night on the island. I draw
fire
watch.
JOKER hears a muffled sound. He isn't sure where
it
comes from. He slowly enters the latrine.

48 INT. LATRINE--NIGHT

Running his flashlight across the room JOKER Sees
PYLE sitting on a
toilet, loading a magazine for
his M-14 rifle.
PYLE looks up at
JOKER and smiles. It is a
frightening smile.
PYLE
(strange voice)
Hi, Joker.
JOKER stares at PYLE for a few
seconds.
PYLE has quite clearly snapped.
JOKER
Are
those ... live rounds?
PYLE
Seven-six-two millimeter,
full metal jacket.
PYLE smiles grotesquely.
JOKER
Leonard .. . if Hartman comes in here and
catches us, we'll both be
in a world of shit.
PYLE
I am .. . in a world . . . of
shit!
PYLE gets to his feet, snaps his rifle to port arms,
and
starts executing the Manual ofArms.
PYLE
(shouting)
Left shoulder ... hut! Right shoulder ...
hut! Lock
and load! Order ... hut!
PYLE picks up the loaded magazine, inserts it
into
the rifle and smartly brings the rifle down to the
order arms
position.
PYLE
(shouting)
This is my rifle!
There are many like it, but
this one is mine.

49 INT. BARRACKS
HALLWAY--NIGHT
By now the platoon is awake.
HARTMAN bursts from his
room, wearing his
skivvies and D.I. hat.
PYLE
(offscreen)
My rifle is my best friend! It is my life!

HARTMAN
Get back in your bunks!
PYLE
(o.s.)
I must master it as I must master my life!
Without me ...

50 INT.
LATRINES--NIGHT
HARTMAN Storms into the latrine.
HARTMAN
What is this Mickey Mouse shit? What in the
name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals
doing in my head?
(to JOKER)
Why is
Private Pyle out of his bunk after
lights out?! Why is Private Pyle
holding that
weapon? Why aren't you stomping Private
Pyle's
guts out?
JOKER
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform
the
Senior Drill Instructor that Private Pyie has a
full
magazine and has locked and loaded, sir!
HARTMAN and PYLE look at each
other. PYLE Smiles
from the depths of his own hell.
HARTMAN focuses
all of his considerable powers of
intimidation, into his best John-
Wayne-on-Suribachi
voice.
HARTMAN
Now you listen to
me, Private Pyle, and,you
listen good. I want that weapon, and I
want it
now! You will place that rifle on the deck at
your feet
and step back away from it.
With a twisted smile on his face pyLE
POintS his
rifle at HARTMAN.
HARTMAN look suddenly calm. His eyes,
his manner
are those of a wanderer who has found his home.

HARTMAN
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?!!
Didn't
Mommy and Daddy show you enough
attention when you were a child?!!!

BANG!
The round hits HARTMAN in the chest.
He falls back dead.

JOKER and PYLE stand looking at the body.
Then PYLE looks at JoKER and
slowly raises his rifle.
JOKER
(trembling)
Easy, Leonard. Go easy, man.
PYLE breathes heavily, and Keeps the
rifle aimed at
JOKER.
JOKER is scared shitless.
PYLE looks at
JOKER for several seconds and slowly
lowers the rifle. Then he stumbles
back a few steps
and sits down, heavily on the toilet.
PYLE turns
away from JOKER and stares into space,
a strangely peaceful look
transforming his face.
He places the muzzle of the rifle in his mouth.

JOKER
No!!!
BANG!
PYLE pulls the trigger and blows the back of
his
head over the white tiled wall behind him.

Syrup sippin'

Paint drippin'
Finger flippin' whoever be trippin'
So hypnotic
Pulling strings, like to feel harmonic
While my name circulate like a narcotic
Pushing keys like Beethoven I got it
And I do it with ease these motherfuckers forgot it
Oh, but now they know (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

Please, this shit's so fuckin' hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

Thirty-thousand words in a rap
That's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait
When I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours
Fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin'
But I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up
I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up
My bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick
Freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back
See my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed
Do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team
Earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid
I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin
Until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up
Yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hunnid bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits
Got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought
Camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops
Fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Call me Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon
Boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on
And I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up
Shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin'
See the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face
I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records
Who's your favorite artist? 'Cause I'm sure better
Well, maybe not, but I tried, though
Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino
'Cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow
Turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track
Give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap
And some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear
I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say
"I'm not here to play"?
"He got a flow and a voice now
I remember when he chokin' a boy out
But he's back in, showin' no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?"
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how
Got these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud
When we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny
My parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try
Tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line
All of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys
You better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch
Now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch
And you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense
Makin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube, off AdSense
All of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for "Rap God"
1.6K words
Though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
And I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, uh
All of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top
And we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh
All y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit
'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it
That subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap
Old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro
Now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin'
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!
You might also like

Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I "must behave, Ben"
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, "Bye", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

How can
I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury
Nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be
And it's in inconceivable dreaming
I know it's so unbelievable, being
Stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving
They givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing
What life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone
So I know when and where to cross it
All over the place
I'm surprised I haven't lost it

Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

Okay, it's time to go fast
So sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it
You gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second
I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track and fed it
Mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit
Want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it
Kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it
If I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it
Think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it
If this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this
Voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else
People want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better
Than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that
I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper
But I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find
Lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life
I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions
So much knowledge, I can't use the lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession
I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it
I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that
They just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it
I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'
And makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless
Ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited
Get off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now
Success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now
I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy

Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, "Reach for the skies"
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, "Why?"
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.​
I'm screamin', "Hi" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', "I got that paper on me"
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least

Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand
That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy

Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
-Most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
My chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through
These lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now
See ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now

It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, "Why you record so much?"
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, "Who would'a thought?", like, who would'a guessed it?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, "No," and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, "Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?"
I don't get it, I don't really understand
I've been living like, "Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand
Next to all these average fucking sad duds?"
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

Uh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever
But in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh, but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, "OMG, relatable!"
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
-Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

Okay
Okay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in
Thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-
-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens
They be tens or more, they be tens or more
I like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'
Damn, I've been livin' in a headache
Bitches never listenin', they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm livin' out
In my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'
Ooh, but I have got somethin' to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assumin'
Resumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'
That puts me to be in the view of the hidin'
I do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowin', the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded bases
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their space
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared

I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

People say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one
On vacation, I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station
Playing it, making it just get to the worst
My head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, "Oh, this kid is big"
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately, it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite
The fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya 'round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

I've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

Ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this
Picture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite
So I'm like, "Okay... no way"
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on

Like, ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

So I'm like okay, nah, no way
When it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I will say
I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

Damn
Some of these
Are too slow and also too fast
Whatever

I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna brag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is goin' off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

How am I gonna let all of this get to me?
Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity
Ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter
But right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder
'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things
What did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things
I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it
And all of the things that I said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked?
I just cannot wrap my head around it

I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment "Arrowhead water" in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real-
That you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go

Spectacular speculations
-Havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements
-Travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate
Trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and
Reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless
-'Sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations
And watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble
And turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation
And focus on education

But I'm petty, petty, petty, petty
That's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit
That I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram
And I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam
And you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

I've been comin' at this as a man
Trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly
And I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me
And do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes
When a basic bitch try to block me, uh

Livin' life, but you're stayin' the same
How you expect yourself to go take the fame
Make your name, but you don't take the pain
You wanna be unique but not make a change
Like, what? How you expect to go through this
Think about the goals, man, why you wanna do this
So stupid and useless if you never lose it
Risk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-
This ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success
Don't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed
And I'm open to "No" and I'm open to "Yes"
I'll do whatever I can to go to the best
That will go to the right and go to the left
No doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed
When I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest
I keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head
I think "No, why do I even try these things?
I need shiny things like diamond rings
And flying rings and pricey bling- uh
That is what drives these strings
I'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time
Sayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme
Never go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime
Learnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my
Day, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'
To spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain
No, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'
Sittin' with a dream, and maybe
Maybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me
But I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!
Why am I just the B of the A-team
At the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!
Uh, and I believe that I'm makin'
Cease for the takin', it's me in the train, and
I see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and
I keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'
But I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb
Pushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time
So I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there
Get where? I just don't want to get left there

I don't remember
I don't even know what that's from but that was written in there
It's been a lot of late nights, okay?

I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I'm threatening, they don't wanna let 'em in
They told me if I take it, I'll feel better, like it's medicine
But I ain't settling, they tryna rush me, like adrenaline

And labels don't reply so I can get a deal
I've been itchin' for this shit, someone give me a Benadryl
I get hella skill, man, they worried that I never will
Have success in bills, man, the grill- haha seven mill'
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I've been goin' overboard and now they jumpin' on the ship
Man, they hypocrites, pimpin' they butterflies while they in- okay, that one was work, uh
And want my Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child, know I'm anythin' but in the middle, bitch
Man, I don't give a shit, I'm well behaved, and so articulate
I'm the type to ask my fucking teacher for a syllabus
Uh, uh
Existential crisis, every day I think I don't exist
Chicken little, I'm a fryin' pan, I'm a dyin' man
Wake up every mornin', I'ma make a fuckin' diagram
And find a plan to be the highest man in this giant land
Rap so fuckin' hard, I think I'm injurin' my diaphragm
Iron Man, think I'm Iron Man
Kids be puttin' fire emojis on my entire 'Gram, I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singin' in the choir, man
And look at where I am, I never thought I would acquire fans
Acquire bands, say a bunch of random shit and rhyme it, man
That's how much I do not give a fuck, let's go to Ireland
Hundred grand on those rubber bands to hold your fuckin' bands
Listening to the cash register like your fuckin' jam
-Don't understand, like a Republican with a gun in his hand
Sayin' that "Trump is the man to come with the plan", livin' in wonderland
That shit is a fucking scam
Making America show that it's dumb again, ha! Ha...

They told me I needed to do a switch up
My friends told me I needed to get my hits up
It ain't that simple, I'm not someone that white teenagers wanna be like
I can't say "Issa" in a meme and have it pick up
Big up, I'm a transnational British person
Dimension C-137's my biggest version
I've been disturbin', music it isn't listed as urban
Air quotes next to my name in red caps, written as burden
I'm a fuckin' burden to every fuckin' person on this Earth, man
I'm determined, I'm tryna get it workin'
Sortin' out pins and needles like an amateur surgeon, that makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense
This song is conversational, so why you still talkin' to me?
I email artists, they haven't responded to me
My camera just went out, so why you still talkin' to me? Uh
I'm trying to give you free money, not fond of your feat
I'm tryna to make a deal, not call the police
I have free publicity, they don't want to be seen
I guess they don't wanna be seen, fuck these monopoly scenes
Uh, yeah, they collab with rappers with fifty plays
I hit 'em up about it and wait sixty days
Now I'm bigger than these rappers I'm askin'
I hit 'em up again, and then I never get a response, damn
What the fuck is happenin'? Damn

I said f-
Fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit, ayy
What'd it cost me is what it cost you, ayy
G-Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute, uh
No need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

Who's your momma? I need to know who taught you, I need to
'Call you believe, but I'm sure that nobody believes you
I'm makin'-I'm makin' music, as soon as I start makin' money, you tryin' to review
You gonna claim every verse on my album, are you gonna claim these too?
'Cause I am independent, you a little jealous, and you skeptical of how I'm really sellin'
You assumin' that I can't legit defend it, I'ma send you out here with a prison sentence
Copyright-abusin' pricks, tryin' to profit off my music shit
Little do you know that I am not afraid of you, and so I will refuse to quit, you stupid bitch
I'm bad for real, my shit got mass appeal, ayy
Every song that I drop is an anthem, you don't really have to kneel, damn
Freestyle, you don't have to steal, don't like it? Well, you have to deal, damn
If I say it that it's how I feel, it's real, I don't pass no drill, damn
Plug called like we had a deal, man, this shit ain't daffodils, damn
When it all comes d- at my door, get the fl- 'oy like a Happy Meal, ayy
If it does, then I have to kill, name a track like the- you pass a d'ill-
Haha, to 'hi-, killer, bum-uh-dum-num, damn, I have to chill
Yeah, this a new wave, y'all are too late
You say you gon' start tomorrow, well, tomorrow's today
I get-I get all these bags, stuff 'em in a suitcase
You a thief, you be stealin' flows like you Boonk Gang

I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Let's gom random shit, ayy

I take no credit for anything that I do
That's how I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you
That's the reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is
Some crazy shit nobody else's world did
And I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love
But, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck
I've been waitin', 'cause this is
The best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh
And I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted
When all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted

This is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

It's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good groove is really a great recipe
Can't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next
And then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text
Like, "Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel
Like a god— well, you get what I'm sayin'?"
And goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

I said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride
We feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high
Yeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit
All the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it
It's bumpin'

Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this
'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing
Blah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'
Every day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin'

Nearin'- we're nearin' an hour
If you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you
Long time, okay

I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, "Fuck it, I'm livin'"
People getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh

And how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Now, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and
The meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons
Yeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'
I'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people
Man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that is just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
And the next one, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
Uh, I just wish
That they'd go away
And I won't obey
No, I will never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up
With other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G'
But now I'm movin' onto other notes

My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights on all these stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

Everyone knows that it's so amazing
All the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital
My name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it
People liked it before they watched it
I'm wantin' way too much more than I have
And I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I g- vision
Of talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow
I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy
People consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses
It hurts because I am on loaded bases
Advanced shit, I know the basics
Already know them, they're overrated
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'
'Cause now I am open for game, and
I'm charged up
I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players
Don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares?
I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers
And bitch, I am going so later
I got time
My own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines
And I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

I've been all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, yeah
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
To a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one take

-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
Uh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch

I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And then if time is money then free time ain't really free
And all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics, uh

Rebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously, her
Breathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were
Before we could be searched, I'm like "Please, just please work"
Like a lenient slave owner— that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy
I play- I play-
-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?
Uh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, "Ew", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true
I'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do
It's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue
Fillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?
And why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?
That shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up
L—

—cay to the Vatican, havin' them
Good times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when
I was so young, too young to really know fun
But so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed
Yeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away
And it's so far away

This a civil war
It's a fuckin' civil war
Yeah, we be aimin' to the peace
So what we killin' for?
Yeah, anymore
What we even livin' for?
Yeah, they be murderin' for peace
That is a civil war

You know- you know they be lookin' at me right now
Like the sewer system, they about to pipe down
I've been writin' my essays, my webpage
Yeah, I call that a new construction site now
Blue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out
All these questions, man, I really wanna hide out
Or I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout
My shit before I wait to see it die out
Damn, I-I just wanna go along
I'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one
I'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up
They know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the
Doin' in the big leagues like I got drafted
Before the year-round hype over March Madness
Wanna get it to where these girls strippin' down
Like it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes
They be sayin', "Damn, Ben really got savage"
No, but unlike you, I am not average-

Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy

I'm addicted to the screen and the validations
Of people who are thirteen in another nation
I've been looking for acceptance in the message
Or a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted
Like Internet track meets, they erased it
Look at this shit, I've just recently made it
That how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'
Acheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it
Y'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro
You doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out and be me, believe in my own zone
Things become intense in the heat of the ozone
It's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so
Can I pretty please just be al-alone?
Nobody to retweet, delete on my home phone
I ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit
When they all claimin' they love it, uh
I ain't gon' hop on that loud shit
When I know I ain't about it, uh
Yeah, they cannot take this away now
They have something to say now
You cannot order this shit on a takeout
All of these bitches is fake now

—My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, "Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy"
Trappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick
'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, "What the fuck's happenin'?
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Puttin' it off to the side
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Damn
Every morning
I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
I put too much work in this shit to go pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I am mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
And I'm practicing hard
Never goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start

Uh, yeah
Putting my mind on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining the cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen, I'm
Eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest


Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh, yeah
Ayy

Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key, and
So I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sorta lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longin' to be a five-year-old, chillin', flyin' a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else workin' more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is movin' towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm tryna get a couple "OMG"'s
Or a, "WTF, he is so sexy"
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you sort your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers' shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous if people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;
It's way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and play, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy-ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Woah, this shit is corny, you really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'ma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake sayin', "Oh, man"
Not again, got a lotta friends who wanna end
All my shit, unsubscribe like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay, 'cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sittin', gettin' in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singin', "La-la", I got two LA's-
I be laughin', "Haha" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- gettin' sick and sicker
The flow on the track gettin' quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winnin' these bigger
Killer victor, not swipin' left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playin' these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spittin' these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changin' their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin'- I'm winnin'- I'm spittin' a million words per the minute
I'm in it to win it, I'm in it to win it, I'm fixin' to hit it, uh
This shit is my mission, not up to your opinions
You know that I'm grinnin', ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

But I don't wanna be a ribbon in the sky
Livin' in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of their eyes
Figure if you're livin' or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealin' with these guys, know that I ain't black and I rap
So I guess I'm automatically wack, when, matter of fact
I am better than like half of these actors
Outdated, like a battery pack that a Blackberry has
On the back of its tab
-Rapping has the wrath of attack to send a missile back to Iraq
Then leave a crack on the map
And put my train of thought right back on the track, oh
All these rappers out of breath
-That gasp like a motherfuckin' asthma attack, yeah
Match, match, match, makin' flames when I swipe right
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some crap on an app
-Blowin' up with bars like a TNT
Blowin' up: TNT, with bars: AT&T
I'm the one you may see on a screen
I won't be passin' out like, "Hey! Is he on lean?"
Nah, I ain't about that
The music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack
To the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back
Everybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back
I got a lot on my mind, I cannot go behind
Uh, ayy, ayy, ayy
I just deleted the- all those lyrics
But that don't matter, 'cause I'm sayin' them in spirit, bitch, uh!

Who would'a, who would'a thought
That Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doin' a lot, ayy
See me for the music I make
Not the views, not the shoes that I bought
I mean who would'a thought that I'd go up, up and away?
5K to 100K in a month how I play
'Fucker think he runnin' the game
See these haters, now they runnin' away 'cause I've come here to stay
Comin' from the jump in L.A.​
But a boy been comin' up in the Bay, where they utter my name
Man, I'm like, "What-what do I say
To a friend who think we one in the same?" 'Cause I'm done with the games
Sayin' "This is fuckin' insane"
Wanted bars, well, no one can complain, yeah, they lovin' the claims
I got an abundance of pain
When I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into-
Yeah

Who would'a, who would'a thought
That a motherfucker'd hop on UK vibe like I'm Drake?
Ayy, who would'a thought
I'd be spittin' all these syllables without makin' a single mistake?

But, I've actually- I've actually made a lot of mistakes, ooh, ooh
I've made a- made a lot of mistakes, ooh
I'm so big, I make hippopotamus shake, ooh
That's-that's really bad, ayy

Uh
Got to drink some water, it's great
Got a lot on my plate... uh
Damn

This is the third time we're on this beat
I do this beat like twenty times
But that's okay, 'cause you know I got so many rhymes
You know what? On this one, I'ma just freestyle, uh
Uh, I got all your bitches on my speed dial
Ayy, and you sittin' there, meanwhile
I'm doing all this shit, I got it like it's a free trial
Free trial, I ain't spending no money
Now everybody lookin' at me, say I'm so funny
But not in a way where they're laughin' with me
Now they're laughin' at me, man, they so silly
They so- they like BILLY by Tekashi
Now everybody, you know that they wanna stop me
But they not gon' stop me 'cause I'm not gon' let them
And now, everybody, you know that I want to get up
Into the best place, into the best place
Now everybody, I be writin' all my essays

'Cause who else is doin' hu- a hundred-sixty pages on a damn song?
Uh, 'cause I'm makin' this so damn long
People lookin' at me, need a blood- motherfuckin' tampon
Yeah, 'cause he's so borin' now

Demonstratin' what I gotta do now

Ooh, ooh, and I'm licorice

You be lookin' like a damn "Oink, oink", bitch
I got all these people, man, you know you so annoyin'
No annoyin', I don't really even know now

When I'm doing shit, I'm getting drunk, I get delirious
Uh but you know I do it sober

Little bitch, 'cause I'm lucky, I got a lot of good luck
Uh, I said, "Bye, have a good f-"

Drumline, like I'm doing this on a TV show
Now you see me, I'm like C-3PO

People lookin' at me, but you know I gotta- start more
Start more when I'm playin' on a pitch
People lookin' at me now, they see me, I'm on Twitch
But I ain't on Twitch, I only streamed like one- or twice
People lookin' at me, now I'm not so nice

Make a loud sound, make a loud sound goin' downtown
Ooh, all my music is surround sound
You hear it everywhere you go, spin around now
People lookin' at me, now they never want to drown now
All your music gets drowned out in a conversation
I got these people see a star, I'm in the constellation
And you know I compile it in a compilation
Everybody, man, you know that I be livin', ah-ma-raisin
Uh, ah, uh, I don't- didn't even say a real word there
Didn't say a real word
You a real nerd, I'll be flying like a real bird

People lookin' at me, but never gonna thank ya
Actually, don't test my gangster, 'cause I don't claim to be one
People lookin' at me, and I'm great, and they see ones
See fun, see ma- I just see more
Uh, yeah, your name is Seymour
Your dad's name is Seymour
I was doin' this shit, like way before
I was on tour, because I just had to take a detour
Uh, and you know that I des-
Destroy, destroy
Who are you? But I'm me, boy, but I'm- uh, me-me, boy
I don't do this shit, I just do this shit
All these rappers, man, you know that I am ludicrous
And I'm movin' bricks to the top of the charts
People lookin' at me, and you know that I'm not gonna start
I'm always gonna do it, 'cause I'm never gonna stop
People lookin' at me, now I'm sendin' all these shots
To the top of your dome, hit you, whip 'em in the dome now
Uh, and your bars, they get thrown out
And you know that I be doing this, I'm goin' down
Uh, but I'm goin' up, you goin' down!
I had to re- had to- had to do a re-phrase
You know how I had a great day
Uh, I might pull up wit' an AK
Uh, and you know I'm gonna make a great plate
Great plate, great escape, I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn
Uh, uh, uh

-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, "Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?"
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan man?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing
I'ma do this shit goin' on my campaign
Celebratin' every day, I'm drinkin' champagne
Ooh, and you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, "How that changed"
But- t-truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded, I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far
I might go in Mario Kart in a go-kart
I got people, now you know I'm goin' so far
So far, but I'm never gonna backtrack
I got all these people send me pics on the Snapchat
But I don't even use Snapchat
People lookin' at me, I might move that back
To the past rap, I be doin' mad facts
All my math facts in my math class, I got backpacks
On my back-back, bag-bag it up
I got all this money, now I stack-stack it up
Oh, ayy, freestylin's pretty fun, though
To be honest, you be lookin' like a dumbo
Oh, oh, who's the winner, bitch?
You already know who won, bro!
That's-that's a horrible bar, bitch
Bar, bitch in my car, bitch
I just do this shit, I'll do this shit like an Arby's, Ar- bitch
I don't know, I just do this shit, uh
And you know that I am too legit, uh

Well, who has ever flown like this?
The only kid who's so legit and going in
They focusing, they noticing, they know it's him
Got doors I be opening
Uh- game like some Yeezy's, I've just broken in
They all convinced that I ain't supposed to win
Now my flow's like water, 'cause it's soaking in
They won't go swim, more salty than a ocean is
I'm floatin' in-

Seen as automatically wack, uh
Like an asthma attack, havin' ass in the back of your class
But you know that I don't give a motherfuckin' half of a crap
Matter of fact
I ain't never gon' be packin' my bags, and that's a wrap

People lookin' at me, now they likin' how I rap, uh
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap song
People looking at me, know my rap is that long
It's too long, too long, might make a few songs, uh
I be gettin' bread like a crou-crouton
Cuttin' out my paper like a coupon
Uh, might rate it like Groupon
Get your group on, jget your raps on
People looking at me, now I make a rap song
Uh, uh, when I'm with your girl, I last long
That's a fact, bitch, better put it up and fact
That's a fact, better put it up in stone writin'
People lookin' at me, they be like "I don't like it"
Well, that's too bad, I might have to go bike you
Off to the ship because, to be honest, man, I don't like you
Don't like you and that is the true shit
Uh, now you lookin' like a U, bitch
Rubik's Cube, but I ain't Logic
Uh, uh, don't do this shit for the profits
Let's be honest, I gon' make a promise
Uh, now you know that I be on this
Old advertisement, phone service, Vonage
Bon voyage, bitch, I'm on this
Uh, uh, got a Hamlet
Shakespeare, but you know you're glad that I came here
Uh, and I'll be doing this, got a great ear
I'm just listenin' to this shit, you know that it's so clear
So clear 'cause you know all of y'all not here
Uh, damn
Gotta take a sh- take a sip of this fuckin' water
*takes a sip of water*
Uh, let's read this fuckin' book
I'm just goin' in this shit, have a fuckin' look
Uh, uh, Rosencrantz
Yeah, you know I do my dance

But to your dismay, this isn't your day

Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
I am alive, immortalised
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey, there's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Benji X Scarlett:

The Lonely Island:
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty-year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be carefulo
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

But I got rich on all these *****s, I didn't forget, back

I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These *****es know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that

Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back

His lil' brother Luigi, he was a real *****
He took mushrooms, they used to make him feel bigger
His job was to pick up the **** like a pooper scooper
And drop it off without gettin caught by the Koopa Troopa
One day they hit Mario on the jack
Told him they had his *****, want a hundred stacks to get her back
He thinkin "What kind of **** is that?
This ain't a video game, lame, we finna go tit for tat"
He lit his cigarette, took a drag of the cancer smoke
And with this hit, he burnt a hole in the ransom note
Then he wrote with ease and I quote
"Y'all must really want one of these in your throat"

Wop, wa-wa-wa-wop, wop, wa-wa-wa-wop (Yeah)
Wop, wa-wa-wa-wop, wop, wa-wa-wa-wop (Ayy)
BoyWithUke:
All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh
TheFatRat:

Billie Eilish:
I'm not your friend
Or anything, ****
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, ****
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
FGTeeV:
Who wanna party? We don't need a club
Let's get it started going all the way up
I got the boys with me, open the door
Press the #50 going to the top floor
Party, party, party in the elevator
Party, party, party in the elevator
Yeah, we going up, up, up
Party in the elevator
Party, we party, we partying in the elevator
We're going up, up
, up like all the way
I got my cup, cup, cup fill it with a drink
You got the snacks, yeah, DJ up in the back, yeah
Turn the volume up, uh! Pump it up to the max, yuh!
No grown-ups allowed, only kids in the crowd!
You know it's going down when we going up to the clouds
They can stay here, we'll see them later
Hands in the air, party in the elevator
THE END <

I figured I'd teach him a lesson, and make him earn respect
I give him props though
Cause he's the first Tsunami that surf's the net
I used to think, "Why his trigger's never bust?" Then I came up with one conclusion
Your jack's got bad internet connection, they got trouble shootin' (troubleshooting)
But not me though, I get the beam and start grippin' the mag
And boy the way these guns pop up, you would think they internet ads
So once I give out the word and I tell the shooters
Well y'all gon' watch him freeze up like Dell computers
If your mom knew you were Crip, she would beat yo' ass
And boy as your dad, I'ma rest in peace ya flag
Soon as you act up, I guarantee you I'll heat the mag
And have your whole team resemble a slumber party cause I'ma make you all sleep in bags
As far as a hustler, y'all never see dude on the strip
He Mike D'antoni, he don't know what to do with them (K)nicks
I chop the white like David Lee, then I'm pursuing it quick
You'll feel like Patrick, that's cool, now you in (Ewing) some shit
My name is something you should never mention Aak
Cause I'll shoot you in ya neck and ya chest will drop
I swear to God I'll fuck you up if you disrespect my block
Cause my hood is loyal and they'll cookin' all you (oil) once this Wesson pop
I'm so nice, I'm so cool, I'm so clean wit' it
New hat, new shirt, new jeans and a new fitted
Them dirty bums, that razor beard, they call it "Dirty Jersey" cause you in it
You and Magic Johnson both had Ill, he handled it, you didn't
I'ma fool with it, I'ma push his frame back until it's reclinable
They should've put this battle on Dash Living cause this ass whippin' is undeniable
I'll roll up to his crib with two shooties, remind me of the Martin show
Cause this time I'm rollin' with two Tommy's
He's Kinkos, once he gets fax scanned and his goons copy
And I mean there's all type of Waves, but for some type of reason these bullets wanna Surf in Tsunami
Now from your last battle I done seen this nigga with bad attire
You a fag, I nigga I done seen trash this flier
If it's beef, you would never hold the Magnum liar
You a baby with the heat, you'll past the fire (pacifier)
But not me though, I swear to God none of you niggas doubt it
If swag was a new change of clothes then I got on a different outfit
I'm the realest, everything I spit I live about it
Will Smith gadget and boy once I flash it forget about it
He a Giant, I'ma make him Jet with this wild noise
Soon as your Saints come marching in they gettin' greeted with this cal' boy (Cowboy)
Arsonal used to run ya state, but now he makin' rap songs
And come to think about it, I never thought he was that strong
But since he left and you runnin' the city and his ass gone
Even though you tryin' often, you Michael Jordan, you ain't never puttin' Jersey back on
Round one it's gettin' hot in here
And y'all know my slogan
(Get him the fuck outta here!)
No! Get his hat the fuck outta here
Get his raps the fuck outta here
Get his team the fuck outta here
Get them jeans the fuck outta here
Get his gear the fuck outta here
Get that beard the fuck outta here
Smack if you got any cyber security get him the fuck outta here!!
What's up!? What's up?! What's up?!
So if ain't nobody home, I squat with that chrome, eat my Snicker
While I wait, contemplate if I should go straight Boston Strangler or DC Sniper
Get comfortable, I got nothing on my hands but time, I'm a lifer
See his moms car lights pull up, aw shit
Gloves, check
Scalpel, check
Mask from Saw 6
Hop out the bushes, burn down, no hesitation
Somebody dyin', gettin' straight to the point period, so exclamation
Pay close attention, the whole plots thickening
Call his grandmother
"Hello"
BOOM! Law Abiding Citizen
Add me, subtract him, death is the equivalent
I'm shots of gasoline straight, you margarita cinnamon
This banana clip spread long when I'm peelin' him
Get rid of him
The only person that could possibly find the remains is Gillian
I know he don't shoot cause he got gum in his mouth and barely pop that
Cops find him, but won't identify him by his teeth cause he barely got that
You got a .22 snub flow, I'm strapped with an Uzi
The last four bars was a commercial, now back to the movie
Call him up, "Yo Eric I need paper."
Then put the phone on speaker, grab his mom by the trachea
Then take my time as I grind her face on the cheese grater
He come home his sister neck hooked to the sink, by a chain
Tape recorder on the counter, he press play, "Let's play a game."
Now your mom's downstairs with a bear trap around her head
The key in ya sister belly
Scalpel, you got five minutes to get it out or mommy is dead
Aye Miles, I advise he find a knife up in this motherfucka
Cause somebody gon' lose they life up in this motherfucka
When I come through, destruction, believe me
Cops like, "We got a murder in Queens. Looks like we're gonna need a dustpan and a squeegee."
All them pumpkin seed raps will get you a cracked shell and a pair of 'Pretty Wings' cause I play with the MACs well (Maxwell)
Switch blades then his gums hang
All red when you see Tsu, whoo (Soo Woo) like the Blood gang
He asked me, "What's crackin'?"
But we had on the same hat so I clapped him
'Fore I screamed "Caliente", it's Latin
For the karats (carrots) I'll kill this silly rabbit
You'll get your whole lane split when I bang on ya
I hope that thang on ya cause I'ma burn down to keep pullin'
And pullin'
And pullin' like I'm a motherfuckin' chain smoker
Look like you snitch, like you got that pork in ya
I'll pull up, give his top ten; SportsCenter
{SportsCenter theme}
It's the sport cast
The number one freshman in URL against DNA's dork ass
Never been a shooter, a for sure pass
A member of the support cast
Cortez take most of the shots, but most of 'em bricks
Him and NuBorn roll playin' settin' most of the picks
Nerd!
I don't know what them niggas in NY see (NYC)
I stroll through the Hollis Tunnel and find where them niggas in NY be (NYB)
Bunch of ducks in the school, suckas in the class
I'm amazing with the numbers, so I fucks with Math
But y'all niggas, them small niggas
That get a piece of a part of a piece of a part of a small figure
If he do a lot of talkin' he gon' do a little dyin'
{Time gets called}

Yo, this nigga from Jersey, and in his first second round he mentioned NYC
Did a little segment, you said some shit about NYB
He said he good with Math but I gotta make him understand
I'm hot like a fan
I'ma get locked in the chamber (D. Chamberz) for usin' my hands (Hanz)
So now let's be honest my nigga, you don't like the strip
You not good with the work, you don't got dimes or bricks
Even if you from Jersey, you don't even got dimes of piff
And we all know he don't push ki's (keys) cause he ain't into that type of shit
And as far as your chick her moves insane and I love booty game
I called her up, an hour later
His cutie came
I bagged her off Twitter, took her to the crib and abused the frame
And her pussy was like a password, cause I stuck my log in (login) with no username
It took her days, weeks, months, years after
And finally after listening to my music she discovered I was a real player
See, he act like he brave as hell, but there's nothin' that this herb start
You pussy, if your first name was Dale you couldn't earn heart (Earnhardt)
And if you really want drama, battling me is the wrong move dunny
And for takin' D light (Delight), well that's something I wouldn't do sonny (Sunny)
See he gon' front like he gangsta, he ready to put up a good fight
But nigga you Kanye West, you a Good kid, livin' a Good life
He ain't ready for combat, he ain't ready for this hood type
But when that TEC blow, you gon' resemble Death Row
Cause today ain't gon' be you or Suge's (K)night
See, just when y'all thought it was safe, ready to call it quits
I started thinkin' like Hollow Da Don and got on my torture shit
I wish that your mother's head gets caught on fire and burn in flames
And when you come out to help her, you get stuck in a category five hurricane
Then I wish ya dad get stuck in a tornado on ya birthday
And when he tries to escape, his legs get stuck in the equator from an earthquake
Then I hope that ya sister on a bus wait for her ride home
Gets thrown 60 feet in the air from a massive cyclone
Then I'll kidnap them all, take 'em to the ocean where the current will move properly
Wait for the biggest storm and drown your whole family in a tsunami
See I'ma have Tsu dyin' once this .9 clap
And in the casket is where he'll be lyin' (lion) for thinkin' he a wild cat
Now his mother, sister, aunt, niece, they all holdin' they head
Cause your death got something in common with Spiderman
They both gon' be all over the web
I used to think that Tsunami Surf was tough, ready to spark clips
Used to think if it was beef he'll be sellin' them hard bricks
Used to think if it was drama he'll be the first one to start shit
Until I found out your real name is Remel Shawn Smith
Aww shit
And with that name being saying that I'ma grip and press him
Get the bullets right there to split his section
And have him resemble a rap group once y'all see me give Smith a Wesson (Smif-N-Wessun)
See he think I'm pussy like I really won't peel shit
Oh you think I'm soft you thinkin' I won't shoot you but I Will Smith

I knew it was gon' be a lot of crowd reaction, cause he brought his group
But my Corona Queens bitches gave me the scoop
E'rybody got the , e'reybody got the fo', well that's how the story go
Until you bump into somebody that know somebody that they know
Then it's like, "Eric? Psst. He used to sit in front of his class
Dirty tees, capris, tube socks to his calves
Kid hyped on his mother. He blame it on his dad
But never say nothing cause every time he open his mouth they laugh."
Pride get tampered with, feelings get hurt
Even when the joke ain't on him he still just smirk
Transformer lunchbox, favorite sport soccer
Only senior lettin' freshman bang his head on the locker
I don't know who tried to shoot 50 or who tried to Flame Waka
But my attempts ain't attempts
So if I bang, flame, I gotcha
Smack him in his neck, clip him while he was walkin'
Had a girl, but his whole hood used to flip her (flipper); dolphin
E'rybody like her ass, she a simile
She ain't even like him, but he helped her in her chemistry
Carry all her books, hold all her bags
Look away from the Bloods, smile at the fags
So why the fuck should I think you got the Glock on?
You a dirty nigga, prolly don't even got socks on
You try and play, I'ma press the stop button
First a {gasp} then the shot comin'
Then table, a suit and a box comin'
'Bama, I change your whole state when I Barack somethin'
I YouTubed Eric, all the verses the same
Pay attention to the letters when I smack him through his name
Diss Nigga Ass, Ass Nigga Dumb
Do Nothing Aggressive, Aim but Never Drum
Everybody wanna Surf 'til they on the bottom with the creatures
Your last name "St. John"?
Well I put Papa St. John in the oven for the cheese; pizza
I squat and just watch, I got Buddhist monk patience
I see him through the scope, through the window playin' Wii car racin'
Danny Granger with the shot I wait 'til he start pacin'
Then safety down {draws breath}
Then smack across the room like the bitch from Smoking Aces
He think he gon' oun me? Shiiit, I ain't Oun P
Class over at 3:00 I'm right where his school be
Climb through the window, give Cortez 80
Put NuBorn in a bag I'ma Brenda this Baby
Catch him slippin', one from the Smith &
Dunk his face in that dark brown liquid
I General Tso Chickens
It's BK, anything he want he can have it
Beef with all three? Bring them Whoppers
Triple Decker that casket
He get GrindTime stomped for reppin' with the squad
You try to grind on my time and I'ma turn this into an episode of Scarred
Never been a Memphis Grizzly and you a koala bear
Ambulance gotta scrape him, and when they take him holler "Get him the fuck outta here!"
They don't get paper, he don't got no cheddar
Anything he can do, I can do better
When it blam it go through DNA, then Soul Khan then Conceited
Then I throw it in reverse, wait, let me repeat it
Conceited Khan hit Con's soul with a blam then it hit him
AND!
Modern day Roman, no hood as nigga
He'll prolly run before he pull ass nigga
That Super Soaker on full blast
The nigga chose the pussy over green...Tiger Wood ass nigga!
{Time gets called}
No!
 come through on my Katrina shit
 beam, no cup he'll lean a bit
Competition long, customize with that Pringle clip

Look, Tsunami Surf said he repped that six, so I make sure I keep my pistol tight
Got goons on each block, they all ready to inf' and snipe
If shit go down, everybody in my clique gon' fight
They got me feelin' like Superman but I ain't scared of this Crip tonight (Kryptonite)
My niggas got Fischer Price guns, we call 'em "The big toys that move."
Yeah I know he's a Crip, he hands out with the boys in blue
I find it funny how you work in the prison and you don't got bars
And how you hang out with the boys in blue and you still can't afford to cop cars
If that's the case than we can't believe shit that this bitch talks
And since he can't afford to cop cars, then that might explain why we always see this Crip walk
But I catch him on his hood on his backstreet
And since I see (sea) food, I deliver him shell as soon as me and this crab meet (meat)
When I first met him, I really ain't have beef with this lame
But when he kept mentioning me like Obama, things proceeded to change
Now when I see him, I'ma put the heat to his frame
Get violent, nigga that TEC silent like the "T" in ya name
You a lil' nigga, you ain't never gon' make big moves
And just cause you gettin' dogged out
That don't make you the shit Tsu (shih Tzu)
But I'll creep up to his hood, shoot and slide, let that Ruger fly
All my guns are cohesive with the target, they euthanize
If niggas was ready to kill Surf in the last result was snitchin', and it was do or die
Then the cops will be the first place that Tsu will side (suicide)
See niggas in Newark used to be anemic the way they would hold the iron
They used to pitch the white boy on the rock, like Nolan Ryan
You came to the hood, the murder rate went down and now no one's violent
So you just the nigga known for changin' Jersey like Kobe Bryant
Y'all might not get that though, since y'all doubtin' a great
He gettin' murdered under 24 and he about to get 8 (ate)
If you still don't get that and you doubt me more
Then take Kobe Bryant's old jersey number, minus it with his new number and see I can kill him with the same number as Pau Gasol
As far as my battles, if you combine them then you know the score
I be smashin' 'em
He's Lamar
Niggas that owed him (Odom) be fuckin' his bitch; Kardashian
I'm always in a Bentley, you in a Chevy mister
And if it's beef I'm known to come through in the clutch like Derek Fischer
So if you want drama then we can play y'all sets
I'm Ron, now I show you who this AR test (Artest)
Surf I admit you wild but don't kill
And as far as luck, how you jack as style we don't feel?
GrindTime's street-
I said SMACK's street and GrindTime is for the nerds
Since I did Oun P backwards
I figured since you Crip I kill him with six letter words
{Time gets called}
Awwww shit!
{the crowd wants DNA to keep going. Surf argues that he went over the time limit in the 1st round, but he didn't so Smack let's DNA get his bars off.}

Look, a cypher and a cosign got him cameos on the camera
There's no chance in this combat you surviving this cancer
It's common this coward would wind up in the casket with his fam' lightin' a candle
Cause your career can't stand a Cannon bringing your show to a cancel
He think he cutout to rep them-
It's over!
Get him the fuck outta 

Blacking out with Funk Flex
DMX holds the 12 gauge pump, Canibus holds the TEC
Whenever the head is separated from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for 10 seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Messing with Canibus, the human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
I'm Above the Law, making cops shit in their drawers
They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved
While you pray to Allah, reading your Quran and your teachings of Muhammad
I'm in my crib studying thuganomics
Niggas wanna murder me, that's why my burgundy Suburban be
Full of Secret Service security
Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action University
In aircrafts that takeoff and land vertically
The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me
From the streets of Dirty Jersey to Germany, niggas heard of me
Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort
I get drug tested before I can rhyme on the record
A remarkable specimen with an audible weapon
Processing lyrics in less than one onehundredth of a second
Beef? Bring it! Bullets or barrels, spin it
Fingers squeeze trigger leave you physically disfigured
You might also like
One, two, one, two, come through, run through
Gun who? Oh, you don't know what the gun do?
Some do! Those that know, are real quiet
Let me think you gon' try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gon' buy it regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'm a start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel
My words, I make herbs spit up and squeal
Ill, it's all I've been hearing lately, niggas hate me
Wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefin' but a lot of them bluff
But not me 'cause I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them's tough, that's just a front
'Cause when I hit them niggas like what you want, the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood 'cause raw blow
I have a dog like what? Biting whatever all up in your gut
Give it to 'em raw like that and ain't no love
I do 'em all like that, fall right up in their back clack! clack!
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front of your building but nobody knows who did it
(BARK! BARK! BARK!)
Noriega hold me down baby
Yo, my name N.O.R.E., but only fam call me P.A.P.I
Y'all people homos like the cat who killed Versace
Homo thug, yo I shoulda known sooner
My clique stay in jail like Robert Downey Jr
Like outlaw in the beacon, I'm Nigga Rican!
Most y'all people think you live and y'all weakling
I'm from Iraq, play the cut, smoke mad trees
Mind my own business, concentrate on my cheese
Yo, the door locked, four knocks and one sibble
I'm like '98 live, you're like double dribble
Yo Thugged Out , no rules, playing the game
Every man for himself, just receiving the pain
It's like Utah 21, no outs, just go hard
Rest In peace I got to say to Yami and Todd
It's like my people never learn, money to burn
Yo I'm leaving like me and Nate-ness, let me say this
I used to rock the G-U-E with the Double S
Now I'm in the '98 Black GS
Golden wood kid and my shhh on some full grip
Headlights shine from Def Jam to Crown Heights
Now my clique keep guns, no time for fights
Open the flip on star tech, check the message
Cop ten Sprint phones and caught a deal
What? One in the same like Thugged Out and Ill Will
It's all real, what the deal?
Yo, F' the nonsense, I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemy's offense with a 100,000 horsemen
The hardest motherfucker on the market, right here
I complete in a minute what will take you a light year
Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremacy
Who wanna get touched? The Can-I-Bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushing MCs, jumping out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Interrogating you wack MCs like MIBs in dark glasses
Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunities to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brainmatter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity
Which is actually what happens to any MC for tryna battle me
Right there, uh

Check it out y'all
Check it out check it out check it out y'all
When I creep through niggas just see through just like a negligee
And ain't no talking 'cause ain't much that the dead can say
Long as I'm walking I'll be strapping my dog
Whacking the hogs, Desert Eagle packing the mugs
Metal slabs with yellow tags or 
What happens to those that chose to be foes
I bet his man knows but yo we only getting stronger
And the amount of time we're facing is only getting longer
Get the Mayor on the horn, top the shit to go down
Strap for the showdown, wet up your crib, kick your down
Know you scheming so I got to get you first
Put you right up in the brand new hearse, could be worse
You should have seen what I gave this nigga
Two vests couldn't save this nigga, the way I laid this nigga
Played this nigga but that's what I'm good at
Lay your niggas out fighting pits and busting hood rats
Where's my fucking hood at, I’m flip on niggas like switches
Rib all niggas like bitches, slip all in niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught or should I say a nigga bought
'Cause there's nothing like getting paid for a nigga sport
Kill for what a nigga thought but that's just how it be
And I know that one day they gon' try that with me
But just as long as I'm on top, you ain't stopping
And ain't the motherfuh dropping
Sat shorty down told him how much his peeps missed him boom! One shot blew his respiratory system
Kissed him goodnight, put him to bed
With four mo' to the head so I know he understood what I said
Red was all over the place, it didn't look good
But I did what a crook would, searched the crib and took goods
And every night, it's the stress
That makes me put another cat to rest, make another cat a mess

Ayo they scared to death, misery need company
These crab slackers, people actin' like they're Mad Rappers
Even with a record deal our guns still peal
Break a piece of your brain off, wipe the stain off
Throw the Range off, policiano watch for Hondo
They lookin' at our poster now, playing us closer now
The funds follow us, what, these chickens swallow us
And you wonder why they can't find us
Yo, Jose Luis smoke lah like the Reverend
Look in the crowds, cloud look like coke and heaven
Like whoever sittin' on pies too, he gettin' high too
Mad fly too, a thug too
Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos
Keep your sh' tight just like Jose Canseco's
Batting stance, a majorly we glance
And gotta yell "What, What!" 'cause thug people don't dance yo
I told people, that you did it for show
But niggas thought you was ill, yo, even your ho
Yo for real young blood, I'm really afraid so
Your color's got revealed and now you buy dough
I'm vastos, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, platinos
My people rollin' those, fontos and hydros
We stay smokin' it, these light it up though, we stay smokin it Tone Loc'in it, me and Fat Joe still provoking it

For hip-hop heads I provide the ultimate high
Canibus is the difference between Harvard and DeVry
See I deliver lyrical blows to pose a potential threat
To any MCs I've ever met
Or will meet, I can't be defeated or beat
Lyrically I got more lines than streets
So if you got beef, you better speak now or forever hold your peace
'Cause I'm coming from the stomach of the beast
Representing the East Coast from border to border
I'll battle this whole planet in alphabetical order
From A to Z or whatever the case be
My brainwaves beat against the rocks like the sea
See my style is every color in the spectrum
Your style is plain like trains without vandalism
Steady blinding niggas when I be shining
Holding the Sun in my hand, I walk across the horizon
My IQ number has six zeros behind it
I possess the power to sleep with open eyelids
On a metaphysical level
I'll make you burst into flames just by looking at a picture of you
In fact, whenever I put the match to the buddha
My brain cells become parallel to a computer
Gathering thoughts at speeds that light couldn't exceed
Test scores the Japanese overseas can't believe
When I'm around other MCs I don't know how to behave
I feel like a metal plate in a microwave
Taking niggas beyond the lyrical speed limit
Digging graves and dumping bodies in it when I'm finished
Attracting shit like a musical magnet
I'll freak flows in binary codes and talk to faxes
Lifting weights and taking amino acids
Sprinting through marathons like they was sixty yard dashes
My reactions’ll hit you, before your proactions hit me
Think about it, it’s deep
My fan club got more followers than the Grateful Dead groupies
And my SAT scores got aliens trying to recruit me
’Cause lyrically I got superhuman abilities
And I’ll make a mockery of anybody for drilling me
I get mad respect in this rap game
MCs like you can only call me by my last name
You came out of a woman’s womb
I came out of a space pod, I’m a alien, a lyrical god
You gotta find 20 niggas like God just to even the odds with me
My philosophies are iller than Socrates
I’ll damage your physical with my verbal
My balance enables me to square dance in a circle
To me you’re like a nigga tryna jump a normal nigga's hurdle
And word to my unborn child, I’ll hurt you
Experiment on you like a mad scientist
And if my lyrics drive you crazy my fist'll be your psychiatrist
Like that y'all, DMX where you at yo?

Where you at yo where my dog got it i'm right here dog
I'm right here all right my  can i bust right right right holding you down
All right check it out yo check it check it check it out y'all know get
Back out check it check it check it out y'all

Look in the mirror say my name five times
Turn out the lights and nano took nine lives
Don't get scared now  finish it cuz you started it
Watch they grow out of control now you want no part of it
 when you're harder tell me what you made of
Already lost the stripe cause i know what you're afraid of
We both know you puss but ain't gonna say nothing
Just hit a  off and you can stay frontin
I got your back for now till i case the joint
Plus give the feds a real good place to point you lace the joint
I ain't gonna front i had my hands full
Glad to be alive but you like that's that bull
But now you know what you get when you fucking with
Something you should've left alone that you stuck in
Ducking till that headpiece gets blazed
Screaming this ah cease to the grave
It's over at least for you it is

Enough to kiss i walk away with chapped lips i slap in clips and get down to the sounds of rounds hitting 
And  hitting the ground copperfield  disappear like magic as soon as i pulled the semi-automatic
Out the jacket got you illinois like ken kong was climbing your building movie directors record to be screaming keep filming i
Love to see them rock right cause i rock it right curious people pause like cars and stop lights cause it's banging in the way you
Wouldn't believe just to rate my tape you gotta combine five source magazines  that's 25 mics total i got average
 before mike saying that i'm a mortal fateless carbon monoxide a gunshot and now you're backside from a bullet
Traveling to mach 9 the object of the game is to spark every cell in your brain at degrees hotter than blue flames
Propane gases incinerate you into ashes i got your briefing harder than girls in the mars classes stop bitching about if
It's written on freestyle got the whole spanish community saying i'm muy mao charging  with booty styles 50
Fines in addition to five dollars for whack punch lines see i'm the top dog running the yard and
I represent cause i'm never chained to the fence hence the bad of me is impossible i put your whole crew in the hospital with ivs
And all of their nostrils so stop sleeping on me i ain't a mattress would you do more drama than a soap opera actions don't even think
About pulling out and opening fire gunshots move but i remove bullets for pliers

Puddles what went through the mind of that madman when he committed murder a man that's look looking his eyes looks as though he wouldn't hurt a soul but that's an old
Trick that cycles use knowing that anything might light your fuse your best bet is to stay as far away from me as you
Can it all went down so quick i'm still catching him as he ran shades of light looks more like shades
Of dark let me know whether i'm good or to let the dogs buff touch a  and it's hot now i got it in my pocket
Give it to my dogs watch how they lock it i couldn't take you through the mud and tell you every paper you didn't know

Like please stop them from killing the other one like kill them all get them all do it today and that thing that we use my other half
Threw it away introduced to a personality i never knew existed you think that last one was bad this nigga's twisted so that's four
Souls trapped in one shell which means many more souls trapped in one hell slapped in one cell but not for long
Because ssi contest for my the repeat and less than five i'm back on the streets same four  stop taking the
Medication now i'm laying 
Yo i aspire to kick the fattest  you've ever witnessed from a far side that's even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge i make your head nod to your neck runs out of cartilage i think it's obvious that i could bring
The ruckus scream on your crew like a military drill instructor when i come through  stand still in the
Statues if i have to i battle your whole rap crew then i'll attack you with words that's absurd and rip your goddamn skin off
Just to get on your nerves distortion my brain waves communicate with Martians my fantastic four four
Firepower's awesome no man alive can survive my lyrical army i don't care if you got nine lives or five heartbeats i
Generate volts like electric ills cause i be sparking it like plugs in automobiles and i'm so for real with my
Lyrical skill mentally ill in the brain like cypress hill don't try to sneak attack i never sleep in black i do 360's with my head
When i watch my own back and you should have known that  was there from the start i beat you more times a minute than a healthy heart
Rolling deep with  by the car loads and land cruises and  sixty thousand dollar autos i step
Through your club like a portal and bag all the  because i got more lines than barcodes
Like that y'all where you're at dmx y'all when my dog oh hold on i  that yeah oh no me

Hate me cause they broke and can't floss yo i cop coat cook it up everybody cooked already like a 98.6 why y'all
Like a Chevy you're floss now look how much my juice costs now i'm realizing that you hate me so i hate y'all too
From both sides it's hate so it's mutual beautiful my guns make it suitable shoot at you
Just like statue you know my name nori what what DMX wreck uh

I'ma cat that sit back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you rocked in Sleepaway Camp
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like "What's that oooh"
Bust that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggas thinking they gritty, in one city
Lemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal

Ain't no secret but how is going down when stop put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another  put on a stretcher with the blanket over his face take him to the morgue with the waist cause he
Was in the wrong place at the wrong time so i gave it to him and his chest and his throat and his head and his back do his vest
Yes ain't a whole lot to breaking a  down fast and call me black cause that's how i'm gonna be on that ass
Y'all   think it's sweet but ain't no thing going down until i eat so killing beef you better why you still got teeth
Cause they bout to get knocked out hopped out on that ass with a blast made yo  drop out cop down to where you know what cause you know why you know my
Mother name up in this game and  you know i will never be caught slipping but on some east coast turns New York 
Don't I swear perm to keep  sleeping with the worst sermons bad for the environment put them in early
Clue yeah right slow it down a little son
We're gonna do a cloak all right yo check it out like this y'all yo
Yo yo yo I speaking frequency thoughts why i have trouble hearing cannabis is the lyrical version of German
Engineering yo check it out like this yo yo yo i speak speaking frequencies dogs why
I have trouble hearing cannabis is the lyrical version of German engineering raw metaphors keep
You high for much i can fly around the earth twice but I refuel it once work it out yo speed that up a little
Some flex got my thing going right now yeah check it out y'all
Yo I splattered your brain matter
The Quick Draw McGraw jaw tapper my lyrics hit harder than pissed off line backers
So exercise caution I shattered yours like porcelain mess around and get your life span shorter cause i'm the ultimate evil
Terrorizing people I handcuff your neck to a moving vehicle then i put your block scene on lock like a swat team
Cause I’m totally four pound blocks with infrared beams it seems so stupid that you wanna battle us but we know rhymes like Einstein knows
Calculus
So don't be doubting my shit 'cause i'm the Canibus
And i got more lines than Amelia K
Swiss without a question without a shadow of a doubt i kill a last dragon and drink the last dragon style
 running off with the mouth but they're just cowards afraid of my powers how many  pussing their trousers

Yo, New Orleans, La, Va to Queens, I-95, where we never drive clean
But good, gotta get out the hood, to really make it, now we cake it
Until our whole team'll take it to another level, another Rolie wit
Another bezel, like war against God against another devil
Sustainin', now we're in Moschino, niggas say we changed it, switched it
Now it's Cristal, instead of Mistic, Jose, catch me wit a pigeon and
A gold biscuit, gettin mad lifted, let me find out,, they sellin dimes 
1 ContributorTHE BREAKZ Lyrics
My Plan, create a sacred and holy land
For the spiritually indigenous child woman and man
I'm a run away slave with Jesuit ways
My heart is beyond brave yall freedom is what i crave
Some say follow Jesus
Others tell me not to
I follow dude in the mirror but he only moves when I do
EmceeSkool is how we do when we wake
Because These Are The Breakz

Break a bull like a matador
It matter though, they putting us in categor-
Reeses pieces all kind of sort of flavors for these mеlanin connoisseurs
If we cut em off they'll lose hope
Pressure off our necks like a foothold
Leg up, they reaching for the scoreboard
No asphalt, no blacks get stood on
Impatiently waiting. Turn is up for the taking
Pray to God that I make it. Devil hope that I'm failing
Tryna eat on my makings. Gotta work on attaining
Swallow pride but I hate it
Different clothes I been changing
For better or worse
Struggle like work, no curse
The hexes breakdown I build up worth
In other words, work out and stack my girth. I meant green but I'm rhyming to the verse

From a city where Dey hit them bangs
On the south side lotta things go bang
Bucket boys, Bang To the Bang Bang Bang
Only 16, ... he da Pops, bang bang
Didn’t hit brakes, so he hit that bang
Couldn’t afford diapers, so hit that stain
Cut em off mid sentence, judge sentence like bang
In the jammer that slammer,’, cell gate go Bang
... Lotta Gang Gang, in da hood they bang
Do you wana get changed fo da clique you claim?
...Cemetery eat a bunch of bodies, it bangs
In the field, got hit, couldn’t move dem chains,...
Dang, So insane like it ain’t gon change

But my bars blazing like a boiler or a stove
Exercise my verbs so I never go slow
Plenty paper and these haters  hate 'cha when you getting dough
Cadence so amazing, ears tasting

Manifesting Elevation Loving Optimistically.\
Yea Yea
Starve a woman like me

We the breakz living fast shift tot sticks
Like yo granddad when he said go get a switch
Foot off in yo *bang* till it reach esophaguses
Young *bang* on task no need for syllabus
Do numbers want math used to hate arithmetic
Wood pumped with the gas the drive remedy
Cries turn into rath when you drown in Hennessy
Sighs turn into laughs when you found inner peace
Sometimes you gotta heal through the pain and torture
Fake vs real when fame marry fortune
Wish you had gills tryna stay above water
Devil give deals hard to turn down endorsements

Hit the brakes
Focused on your coffee break, I’m looking for a big one
Like intermission, got an inner mission to show y'all what you missin
Pray to god ,yea i miss sins
Break it down
Sweet sounds coming out the microphone, skip the concrete, yea i grew out the heat
Call me deadbeat gaby cuz i murder every beat
Take a seat
Uh
Breakdowns
Straight down
For anything long as gang with me, emcee 3 something like a cube, no squares, pull up in the coupe, do a show in south loop, loop it back next day, lately been our separate ways
Weigh it all out when we parted, guess we just really broken hearted, distance makes the heart grow fonder, who ever said that hit the target ,always welcome in my garden, when i eat you eat, issa harvest
Ow!

Break down
Mentally we checked out
We got saved by the sound
Now we breaking it down
THESE ARE THE BREAKZ
Break down
Mentally we checked out
We got saved by the sound
Now we breaking it down

(Lemme talk to em one time for real)
I fought suicide and depression
Crucified with a suit and tie like heath ledger
I unify from the brutal ties in a tribe i was scrutinized feel like I’m booked and i’m brutalized but i read better
This is the season to take
Even if steaks were even easier baked
Even in easy bake i ease when i chef
These are the breakz i break with ease then i rest

MELANIN7EVEN
These are the breakz
Like an overweight person, I be moving weight

THESE ARE THE 

Surely, Jon's pipe hold a substantial amount of tobacco, and it is true that pets living in the homes of smokers are nearly 25% more likely to develop some form of cancer... most likely due to secondhand smoke... but these are facts of smoking, its tolls on our world.
But after visiting two tobacco processing plants in Virginia... and the Phillip Morris cigarette manufacturing facility, I came no closer to cracking the meaning. I was looking for any insight. A detective of a homicide case has to look at every angle, so I'm always taking apart the pipe strip.
I focused on every minutiae, every detail of this strip.
Jon Arbuckle's clothing... I have replicas. I'm an expert in textiles... so, you see, this smoking thing was a hang-up for me... but it was the statement here... until...
This is key, this is the breakthrough.
The pipe is not a pipe, really.
Obviously there is symbolism at work here... I saw that from the beginning, and I looked at the literal aspects of the strip to gain insight into the metaphors at play... I worked at a newspaper printing press for eighteen months, in the late 1980's... I was learning the literal to inform the gestural... the subliteral, the in-between...
Jon reading this newspaper means so much more than just... Jon reading the newspaper... but how could you ever hope to decipher the puzzle without knowing everything there is to know about newspapers?!
Okay... for example... Jon holds his newspaper up with his left hand, thumb gripping the interior. I learned that this particular grip here was the newspaper grip of nineteenth century aristocrats... and this aristocrat grip was a point of contention that influenced the decision to move forward with prohibition... in the United States, in the early twentieth century!
So Jon's hand position is much more than that, it... it is a comment on class war... and the resulting reactionary culture... but I didn't know about the aristocratic newspaper grip until I came across some microfiche archives at the printing press.
It's about information. You have to take it apart.
...and the breakthrough on the smoking cat came late... just eight years ago, actually. "Smoking cat" is an industry term. It's what the smoking industry calls a tattletale teenager who tells on his friends after they've all tried smoking for the first time... and it is actually a foreign translation, bastardization of the term "smoking rat"... But the phrase was confused when secret documents went back and forth between China and America...
These documents are still secret, and the only reason I know about the term is because I know a man, my friend. Let's call him "Timothy," yeah... yes, it's a fake name, for his protection. Timothy worked for Phillip Morris for sixteen years, and he had seen the documents... and when he told me, it was an Aha moment... and he said, "But how? How could this cartoonist, Jim Davis, know about this... obscure term from the mid-70's, used exclusively by a few cigarette companies!?"
This is still a mystery to me... but I connect the dots by noting Jim Davis' childhood experiences on a farm. He must have seen something...
What could it be?
Timothy went on to tell me there was one particular smoking cat, a boy, from... yes, Indiana, a boy named Ernie Barguckle, who became a thorn in the side of the tobacco companies for a couple of years... He did more than tattle to his parents; he and his family took legal action, and they eventually received a huge settlement payout...
But that name is too similar... Ernie Barguckle...
Jon Arbuckle.
Jim Davis must have used this.
There's more here. Ernie Barguckle spent nearly half of that settlement money on experimental medical procedures to cure his... impotence. He was impotent.
So... he was a smoking cat with a... a metaphorical pipe, that did not work... Are you starting to see the layers here? This is exciting stuff, you start to get a whole picture here, and it informs the work! It's... it's just remarkable.
Jim Davis took these raw ideas, these... pieces, and he transformed them into smart social commentary that is... all so ravishingly beautiful.
I have cried.
I've cried, I've cried... I've cried, cried over this piece. It just... gets in my soul.
I try to explain this to people, I have... the newspaper articles about Ernie Barguckle... People have fought me on this, they don't see it, or they're close-minded, "How could a comic strip about a cat smoking a pipe mean any more than that?"
But it is more... and when I feel spiritual, or start to think existentially, I still see this comic.
Here's something from 1981 that I wrote in thinking about the implications of this strip; this is just an excerpt here... there's more before and after, but this part is the essence to me... If a comic about a cat smoking a pipe can be the only thing in the universe... then maybe this is the strongest evidence for that.
*fumbles with tattered sheet from 1981*
"Many of you say, 'Oh, but I am not blind. I have never been blind,'... But when you truly see, you will understand just how truly blind you once were to even think it right to say you were not blind.
What does a blind man see?
Blackness.
Darkness.
Blankness.
Blank darkness.
Dark blankness.
The absence of things, quite literally NO thing. No things. Nothings.
So, you see nothing, and I bring you into the light. A cat has your pipe! You've been blind, do you understand this!?
The cat has your pipe.
You can't fully immerse yourself, you don't have the light. You don't have the radiance, the radical light, the radically radiant light of truth and truth's belonging love, and nature of light, and loving truthful radiance.
So don't be bold, and make bold statements. I know of you.
The cat has your pipe.
The.
Cat.
Has.
Your.
Pipe.
Remember that."
*puts paper back in pocket*
That writing, well... It's kind of rough... Kind of an... early eighties feel... and I see that, but I'm still... I'm still proud of it.
Sometimes I imagine that it is the editorial column in the newspaper Jon Arbuckle is reading. It's an exercise in recursion, it's like a vortex opens up... It's like you hold two mirrors up to each other, one is reality and the other is a cartoon strip.
Let's see here... Oh yes, I must bring this up, because I think, surely, Jim Davis is again speaking on multiple levels by including the details set before us in the comic.
Notice the glimpse of Jon Arbuckle's foot in the first panel. The size of the shoe would indicate that maybe the man just has small feet... but a deeper investigation takes us to the footbinding rituals of certain Asian cultures. Inflicted usually on women for the desire of men, this practice was incredibly painful and crippling...
Aha! Mister Davis is, here, presenting us with a man, or rather... "man", who engages in footbinding, a body modification for women, on top of "being without his pipe"... or impotent. This is a man facing extreme inner turmoil, the panels tell that story... subconsciously.
Notice the background wall shading of the first panel points inward toward Jon in the second panel... and the sharp tapered end of the purple pipe in the third frame also points at John in the second panel, inward; the eye is drawn to the center panel. You can connect these points and draw a triangle across the panels, and this triangle will align with the reoriented points of Jon's collar! This, this is majestic artwork!
...and to uncover this hidden order is... bliss like I've never known.
Comforting, in an empty world.
I can't help but read the thought bubble, over and over again.
Now where could my pipe be?
Now where could my pipe be?
It is a profound question.
Why am I here? What is my purpose? It is reflection and self-examination here. It is facing the dust, the misery of a cold, careless universe. You can feel the weight of it.
But where could my pipe be?
One imagines the author, Jim Davis, teetering on the edge of insanity... his rationality, his lucidity, hovering over the void... and he seeks the truth.
You can see it in the line quality of the drawings; the thoughtful, controlled outlines mixed with the... occasional, chaotic scribbles at work in the shadows and Garfield's dark stripes.
It's almost as if Garfield is chaos himself.
Yes, he is the embodiment of chaos, disorder, hatred, fear... Thievery, death, destruction, desolation!
These are the things Garfield represents; HE stole the pipe, HE sits with his back to Jon, Garfield... Garfield, this chaos cat, Garfield has turned his back on everything, everyone!
One recalls the great existential forces in literature... Camus' Meursalt, Kafka's Gregor Samsa, or Sartre's Antoine Roquentin... Garfield the Cat sees the hopelessness of life, which...ah, yes...
This is why Jim Davis has chosen smoking. It represents a recklessness, a... a disregard for what some would define as the beauty of life. Garfield may die from the nicotine, he may not... He defies life; he sits defiant, saying nothing, but looking as if he could say... "Then let me die... it does not matter."
It does not matter.
...and we are faced with this; Could Jon behave the same? Is Jon the glimmer of hope?
He seems to be unsure. Again, his question... "Now where could my pipe be?" indicates that he is wrestling with his own existence. The center panel centers the issue, and again, this hearkens to many of the great religious works of art.
I'm talking about the Pipe Strip in relation to religion. It's... it's interesting to assign the roles of God... and anti-God, or, as many know him to be, the devil... or on a much larger scale, simply the forces of... good and evil. Garfield, the thief-cat, evil and malicious... He is the devil, placed to the right... and note, the two forms of Jon; the Jon on the left, still innocent, still draped in the... delight, of the lack of knowledge. He is... the humans in the Garden of Eden. He feels for his pipe... but he has yet to eat from the tree... and Garfield, the sinister serpent... and notice, notice how Jim Davis has framed this... The center Jon is locked in a struggle, between his innocence, and his knowledge of the truth... knowledge of the existence of evil.
It is stunning. The great struggle, the struggle that transcends time... and Jim Davis floats over all this, as creator... the God, of sorts, in his own right.
... and he presents this cautionary message to us all; it is as if he is speaking from high and... he is saying, unto our awaiting ears...
Where will you be, when the cat reveals himself? 
I can tell you where you'll be. You will have a choice; you can face endless suffering, and eternal misery... You can be forced and beaten down with barbarians, who claw at each other just for a view of salvation. They'll tear your eyeballs out, and rip your gizzards from end to end. They worship this cat, this... this false idol! This evil, horrible cat, do not be seduced by the cat and the pipe!
Garfield... thy name is a mark of the demons of hell. Something like this, and to those listening, it is a stark reminder to follow the path of the first panel Jon; be humble, be grateful, honor the law, and honor thyself. Be true, and be good, and no harm will come to you... Pray for salvation, and it will be granted unto you. Be like Jon Arbuckle, as he lowers his head. Be like Jon Arbuckle as he lowers his paper, as he turns his head. Bow with Jon Arbuckle, and praise unto the creator, Jim Davis... and banish demon Garfield from your life.
So, what is all this? What am I saying? Aha... hmm... What does all this mean? Why is this one comic strip so important to me... and why do I feel the need to share this?
Obligation. I have an obligation to you all. This is a redemption, this is a belief in redemption, a sacrifice of all the obvious trappings of this false modern life.
Look at the simplicity in this strip, in the pipe strip. Look at the simple clothes Jon wears, look at his simple, basic furniture... No adornments on the wall, even the very pipe his cat Garfield stole; it is a plain, modest pipe... and I have adapted this way of life, it speaks to me.
In our times... well... you don't need me to point out the hyperbole of our times; you have children being born eight or nine at a time, you have more money being spent on a single Hollywood movie than some nations can spend... feeding their starving people. Torture, distrust... Look around you, it's overwhelming.
What can you contribute?
...and every day, I look in the mirror, and I hold this comic up to the mirror, and I look into the mirror, and at this little comic strip.
Be humble.
Be thankful.
It is a reminder, be respectful.
You are a statue. You are fragile... and when you break, when you shatter... Where will those pieces go?
Ask... ask, ask, ask this question. Will you ask?
Humankind is only as great as you, YOU, the individual, it begins and ends with you! You must treat this expedition, this search, this... life, with a reverence and intensity found only in the smallest sticks. The littlest leaf, the tiniest stone! The most miniscule grain of sand... on a beach of billions!
This is the secret.
Do you want the pipe?
Do you want to know where the pipe has gone?
You ask yourself, you ask... you ask... you ask...
Now where could my pipe be?
When I was a young man... remember, now, I first saw this comic when I was eighteen years old... Ages ago... but I was youthful, vibrant. For weeks, I didn't hide that a comic strip was having such a profound effect on me.
I was much like Jon Arbuckle. In this middle panel, he says, "Now where could my pipe be?"... you could look into his eyes, his half-lowered eyes, and think to yourself... "Now, surely, Jon... Surely, you cannot be this naive... This is nothing new for you..."
And if you've read more of the Garfield comic strips by Jim Davis, you understand what I am saying now; Garfield the cat does things like this all the time. He will take things from Jon; food, items, anything... This is his very nature.
So you see this, and you want to say, "Jon Arbuckle, come now. You are lying to yourself. You are lying to yourself, and to all of us, if you pretend to have not... any idea of where your pipe has gone. Perhaps you think you've left it somewhere else, but... hmph, you're not so forgetful. You are lying to yourself, ah... yes...
You are lying to yourself, Jon Arbuckle. You know that Garfield has the pipe... somewhere, deep down, you know this. You don't even need to think the question."
And that was me when I saw this strip. One week passed, and each morning I'd open my drawer and slam it shut again. I would go to look at the comic... but I'd pause, and think... "Oh no, I don't need this comic, I don't n... I don't NEED to look at it..."
But there I was, lying to myself.
I DID need to see it, and so I did, it's... cathartic. You give in, and that is the transition, from the second panel of life, to the third panel of life! It is a simple story structure, the passage from the second act to the third, the twilight of things. Jon gives into his suspicions; he knows the truth, he's ALWAYS known the truth, he yells out, "GARFIELD! GARFIELD! GARFIELD!"
It is like... pressure from a steam valve, being released; the buildup is unbearable, and then... PSSHHWW, it's gone.
So it is like this... when I speak about the truth... the truth, the light, the radiance, this... this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. This is the essence of this brilliant work of art, the practical mixing, meeting, agreeing with the spiritual, it is all HERE.
...but spirituality is not an easy thing to confront. You might find yourself able to wrap your mind around a simple math problem, or a basic newspaper article, or... but intellect... is much less subjective.
What is spirituality... and how have I found spiritual peace and serenity in Garfield?
A long time ago, after I encountered the Pipe Strip... I spent some time, as I mentioned before, soul-searching. When something impacts you, or alters your very perception so greatly, there is a long period of confusion, recovery time...
It's as if you don't know who you are, and that can be a... a very scary prospect, especially if you thought you had a good grasp on that sort of thing.
Imagine if Jim Davis did not know who he was. Would he be capable of shaping the cultural landscape as he's done?
No. No, of course he wouldn't.
...and how about his characters? Jon... what if Jim Davis suddenly woke up, and didn't know who Jon was? What if he couldn't make the informed decisions to accurately depict Garfield's personality, because of... he could no longer specify, or demarcate the boundaries of Garfield's behavior?
What kind of comic would THAT be? You see?
So draw the parallel. I saw this comic and, yes, I was disoriented... and if I didn't reconcile this issue with myself, what kind of person would I be?
Undoubtedly dire circumstances, but remember; this was not a math problem, this was not an article, this was not something I could just... figure out... and as skeptical as I was, I realized that faith and spirituality were avenues that... required exploring.
At first I tried... long nights, reading Garfield by candlelight, or... aromatic meditation settings, while thinking of Garfield, but... nothing snapped. Nothing clicked, I still felt lost... but I kept it up, I hired a shaman, and a young... personal Yogi Sikh Guru; Avram Dahb Singh Sahib. I pushed and pushed, determined to find myself.
And then, a miracle happened.
Upon retrieving my morning paper, to clip the Garfield comic... I noticed a young girl, selling lemonade two houses down. She sat, occupied at her stand. She had no customers in sight.
So, I approached, and saw that she was coloring. I looked at her drawing...
Three rectangular boxes.
A man, in a blue shirt. An orange cat.
I knew what this was. Even in her crude scribbles, I knew EXACTLY what this was.
She was drawing a Garfield comic.
I looked at her words, and I saw that, in her strip, Jon asked Garfield to retrieve a newspaper. Heh, funny... since I'd done just that with myself... Garfield is sarcastic, but agrees to. He returns and calls Jon... "Sahib".
Jon exclaims that the paper's all chewed up, but then Garfield says, and I quote, "Sahib asks fish, paper is wet. Sahib asks cat, paper is holey." I remember the words, and ran back to my house, and thought, "How odd that Sahib shows up in the strip, and my spiritual advisor's name is Avram Dahb Singh Sahib!"
Coincidence surely, but, nonetheless, I spent the next sixteen hours poring through my clipped Garfield comics, looking for the strip this young girl had been coloring... I couldn't find it... and I eventually fell asleep, right on my kitchen table.
Next morning, I retrieved my paper again, and I clipped the Garfield comic. The date was July 12th, 1983.
There it was.
The Sahib Strip, in all its glory.
The girl had been drawing the next day's strip!
So, I ran right out of my house, I ran back to where she was... but she was gone, and in place of the lemonade stand was a "For Sale" sign.
They'd moved out.
I rushed back to my house to call Avram, but... I was informed that he'd moved away as well. I reeled, for several hours, and then it all connected for me.
It was meant to be. It w... it was meant to be this way! Jim Davis... Jon, Garfield... It was always meant to be this way for me.... They move to the forefront, and everything else fades away, EVERYTHING else; the girl, the lemonade stand, Avram Dahb Singh Sahib, it all existed to show me the way, and when I'd found the way...
Everything else melted away.
It was a beautiful miracle... and if July 27th, 1978, the day I first saw the pipe strip... was the first day of my life, then that day, July 12th, 1983, was the second day of my life.
I've never looked back. Garfield has transformed me... and I am a man, born anew, because of Garfield.
When I was in my mid-thirties, I was interviewed for a documentary... It was a documentary on the subject of cat behavior. Now, I've had cats my whole life; I have three cats now, and at the time of this documentary interview, I had four cats. I sat down for the interview and was joined by a veterinarian who specialized in felines: Doctor Caroline Wellmitz was her name, I believe... and the doctor discussed colorblindness in animals, and how it affects their behavior.
She specifically brought up the fact that cats are red-green colorblind; they can see colors, but they can't tell the difference between red and green ...and look at the color choice in this strip here.
Garfield sits on a green floor, behind a pinkish red wall.
I heard this, and I immediately pulled a copy of the comic from my wallet to show to the doctor... I moved so fast, I'm sure I nearly scared her, I... pointed at the paper and said, "Like this! Like this! Look, at this here! This cat, Garfield, he's colorblind, he must be! That must be the answer here... like this."
As over-excited as I was, I managed to take in her response; she said "Yes, a cat in this room would have a hard time differentiating the wall from the floor. Add to that a cat's known spatial confusion, and you have the makings of a Cat Rage room." Now, she informed me that this isn't exactly common knowledge among cat owners... but a seasoned cat owner, or someone particularly perceptive will have picked up on it.
So what's incredible here is not only is Garfield's behavior symbolic of the devil, and all the evil constructs in the world, but... but, but... but also, it is rooted in science and scientific fact.
Look at that. You cannot spell fact without "cat".
Hah, just a little joke there... just some wordplay, but getting back on track...
...and you can't spell track without "cat."
Okay... I digress. I gotcha, I gotcha, enough... kidding around.
It is established here that Garfield is in a rage; an ultimate rage of fury and hatred, caused by colorblindness. We know the "what", we know the "why"... but let us examine the "how", the how of his rage is particularly interesting here.
We've looked at his posture and called it "powerful", "in control", "statuesque", "etc., etc." Composed rage... It's peculiar, and I've talked to a number of psychologists and psychiatrists, and even a couple of anger management therapists about this concept...
Could we see the same kind of behavior in a human? Is Garfield representative of something more specific than just chaos and rage? Deciphering this is going to take some perseverance. for sure.
The psychologists pointed to a phenomenon in humans, and, yes, I believe one of the anger management counselors brought it up as well. The idea that people, oftentimes, will bottle their rage... Garfield the cat, here... well, he could be bottling his anger, inside, shoving it deep into his cat gut, to ignore and deal with at a later time.
Eh, well... No, that's not exactly right. Garfield has already acted out, he's already stolen the pipe... he's SMOKING the pipe, he's already dealt with his anger. He's already lashed out, so, psychologically, what is going on here? What is this cat doing, and how does it impact his owner, Jon Arbuckle... psychologically?
Well, Garfield is angry. He is acting on his anger... but is this passive anger, or aggressive anger?
Passive. It is passive because if Garfield has a problem with Jon specifically... he's choosing a passive way of dealing with that problem. He has not confronted Jon, and said, "Jon, I have a problem with the way you've decorated this room; as a cat, I am colorblind, and this room sends me into a rage... You've created a rage room for me here, and I don't like it; I want you to change it."
Instead of that confrontational approach, though, Garfield has chosen to steal Jon's pipe... and that, in turn, angers Jon... but Jon decides to be aggressively angry, and yell at Garfield, so... now, instead of a calm conversation between two respectful parties, you have two... heated, angry individuals, each with a problem and no direct line to solving it.
The layered emotions here tell a story with tight, focused brevity that would make Hemingway weep. This is an entire drama, in just three panels, people.
...but let's not be remiss, and miss the humor of the situation, the... absurdity of it all... for certainly, there is a reason that the visual shorthand for drama includes both the crying mask AND a laughing mask. Comedy and tragedy complement each other, and meld together to create drama, tension, the height of humanity, the peak of art, that reflects back to us our own condition...
...and here... in its basest form, we can laugh at this comic... yes, COMIC, in which a cat smokes a pipe... Hah... when was the last time you've SEEN such a thing in your life?
Never, I presume... I certainly never have...
The Greek muse, Thalia's presence is strong in this work of art, here. Comedy, it is COMEDY... and if you look at the structure again, you'll see this perfect form of thirds works magically for the transmission of, yes, YES, a JOKE.
The joke.... is as old as time... even cavemen told jokes, and the joke here is that Jon has lost his pipe... or he thinks he has... but lo and behold, it is the cat, Garfield, who has the pipe.
Surprise, surprise, the cat is smoking!
Again, the transition, from set-up to punchline takes place between the second and third panels... but make no mistake, the comic is more than just a comic... Yes, it IS funny, of course it is... it is operating at the height of sophisticated humor, on par with any of Shakespeare's piercing wit.
On the one hand, Garfield the comic, with Jon the man, humor as art... the other hand, Garfield comic, with Jon the man, stirring... no, RIVETING drama... as with everything, it is tension, and release. TENSION... and RELEASE...
A cycle.
I keep returning to this idea, because it is so omnipresent. Yes, you could... and yes, I have done this, on more than one occasion... you could print this comic strip on a giant piece of paper. The dimensions would be something like... thirty-four inches by eleven inches.
Now, tape the ends together, with the comic facing inward. Stick your head in the middle of this Garfield comic loop and READ, start at the first panel; Jon is reading the newspaper... he feels for something on the end table.
Second panel; he sets the newspaper down, something is not right...
"Where could my pipe be?" he thinks.
...and then, the payoff; the third panel, Garfield has Jon's pipe, and is smoking it.
But, aha! The paper is in a loop, around your head... so that you can see that, once again, Jon is in his seat, reading the paper... and so on, and so on, you can literally read the comic strip for an eternity!
I spent many a relaxing Sunday afternoon reading this strip, over and over... reminded of the Portuguese death carvings, which always begin and end with the same scrawled image.

So, this idea of repetition, of the beginning being the end, and the end being the beginning... It's not new, it is an ageless tradition among the best storytellers humanity has ever offered... and I'm not wrong to include cartoonist Jim Davis in that exalted set for this particular strip alone
I'm not foolish enough to deny that great art is subjective... divisive, even, and that some people see this Garfield comic and shrug with no real reaction... but I will say that I believe everyone in the world should see it; at the very least, see it!
You should all see it. Read it. Spend some time with it. Spend an hour reading it... what's an hour? Yes, you could watch some television program, you could play some fast-paced video games or computer games, yes, you could do all those things...
But it's just an hour... and if you give this strip a chance, if you look into Jon Arbuckle's eyes... if you look into Jon Arbuckle's SOUL...
You might find that you'll really be looking into your own soul.
It is self discovery, that is what I'm talking about here... YOU have the opportunity, the possibility... it could change you. Don't be afraid.
You know, just last week, I was eating lunch near the Municipal Court... like I do every Thursday, and... there was a plumbing banner... a plumbing van, parked out in front, uh... and a man, a plumber, would step out from the court, and retrieve something from this every so often.
A few times, this happened... I thought nothing of it; just a plumber, doing some work at the Municipal Court... but then he came out, and looked through his van, and it was clear...
He couldn't find something.
I noticed, and thought, "Well, that's sort of similar to the Garfield comic, in a way. Someone looks for something, can't find it,"... but, yes, that probably happens billions of times a day around the world...
...but then, this plumber... put his hands on his hips... then, he scratched his head, and he said aloud...
"Now, where could my pipe wrench be?"
Well, at this, I leaped off the bench, sandwich still in hand, and I rushed over, I shouted, "What was that you said!?"
He looked at me and said, "What? I can't find my pipe wrench, " and I said, "No! No, no, say it... like how you just said it..."
He scratched his head, and repeated, "Now where could my pipe wrench be?"
I slapped him on the back and said, "Garfield!"
He looked so confused, so I said it again... then, I said "Your orange cat took it!"
Heh... ah, then I laughed and laughed... and he smiled, and went back into the courtroom.
I walked away, knowing that the plumber and I, two complete strangers, bonded over this Garfield comic... You see, life imitates art, becomes a common ground.
I have a feeling that if I see this plumber again, we'll be sharing stories like two old friends... because we've been united by art. We have a common love for Jim Davis and his characters, his writings... The humor, the drama, the... that rascal Garfield, the cat...
Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering what I was having for lunch that day, it was a ham sandwich with an apple and potato chips... in a bag, I had a soda as well.
I think it's important to view the Pipe Strip in philosophical terms... We've touched briefly on the notion of existentialism; that theme is very prevalent in this strip. Garfield is, in fact, a modern existential anti-hero... but if Garfield embodies the bewilderment in a meaningless life, what is Jon? What are the telltale signs that inform Jon's philosophical standpoint? His approach, what style of thinking he represents?
Jon is depicted as being grounded in the material world... a world of things; he is surrounded by objects, and he touches these objects, he interacts with them. The newspaper, the end table, the chair... his clothes, all these physical things make up Jon's world. In some sense, even his cat Garfield is an object to him, a thing...
The first ideology that comes to mind when thinking of objects in the tangible world... is pragmatism... Is Jon Arbuckle a pragmatist? His beliefs stem from a useful, coherent view of his environment... a sort of cause-and-effect understanding of his world helps him.
A: Deduce that his pipe is missing... and B: Catches his cat, Garfield, using the pipe.
This kind of empirical and logical thinking lends credence to the idea that Jon is, indeed, a pragmatist... Although, it is hard to entirely ignore the rest of the Garfield comic canon.
While Garfield is consistently anarchic, and embraces the chaos and absurdity of life... Jon Arbuckle exhibits an erratic, unpredictable mix of philosophical behaviors. At times, he is borderline; delusional, an idealist, an almost slap-happy version of Don Quixote. Other moments, he is rigid, nearly to the point of being obsessive... somewhat like a structuralist, and certainly has streaks of sarcasm and negativity that might classify him as a skeptic.
...But isn't there some universal truth in this approach? How can any one man, how can Jon Arbuckle be just one thing? How can any of us be just one thing? We're... an amalgamation of ideas, of emotions... conducts and functions, thoughts and feelings... Jon Arbuckle may very well inhabit tenets of nearly every major philosophical tract known to man.
We all might.
Characters are reduced, to make them recognizable, definable; a story needs a good guy, a story needs a bad guy... but rarely is one person defined in such black and white terms. Even Garfield, with all his bad behavior, Machiavellian motivation and general ne'er-do-well attitude, can be kind and thoughtful.
You just have to find that rare strip.
Speaking philosophically about the entire Garfield franchise, it's an incredibly accurate depiction of life. Its bold lines and bright colors are merely a facade, a... a red herring, a lie. This cartoon is not a cartoon at all, it is not a... caricature. It is not caricature despite adopting caricature as its visual style and tone.
...but I don't really like to speak in broad sweeping generalizations about Garfield.
The comic has been running for over thirty years, and to try and boil that all down is just, well... it's impossible. I think the only way that any historian worth his salt will agree with me is to look at individual moments... isolated instances, single comic strips.
Can I discuss this one strip in the context of the entire run of Garfield? Yes, I do that just as a film historian might analyze one movie in relation to the history of all movies, or a war enthusiast might look at a single battle's impact on an entire war.
The Pipe Strip is just an instance in the lives of Jon and Garfield.
Perhaps Jon is not a pragmatist at all... let's look at this again. Maybe Jon is exhibiting the traits of a rationalist thinker; his question, "Now where could my pipe be?" is a clue that his thought process stems from the early rationalist questions posed by René Descartes. The well-known quote, "I think, therefore I am," attributed to Descartes, is applicable.
Another close look at the strip, and we see that Jim Davis chose to draw Jon thinking his question.
"Now where could my pipe be?"
Jon does not speak this question aloud, so Jim Davis is also exploring the mind/body duality... Jon's question operates on the level of a literal question... but it also examines the nature of reality. Jim Davis' epistemological approach tells us something about the human condition; Jon's thoughts remain the focal point of this strip.
The comic is, quite literally, centered around his thought.
"Now where could my pipe be?"
This is his reality, this is where cognition, and the power and function of the mind take over. As Plato believed, the body is just a shell for Jon Arbuckle; yes, he can use his physical body to read his paper or cross his legs, but these inputs of touch, sight, hearing, et cetera, these senses are the triggers of the mind, as we see here, the mind... is something greater. It is the originator of ideas, and ideas are forever. Immortal.
Immortality through thought, a... a major theme in literature and philosophy...
...and isn't that what Mister Jim Davis himself has achieved?
Will he live forever?
The universe will continue to spread, and spread outward, and... entropy will turn a chaotic infinity into a homogenous, controlled system. This will take billions of years, and in that time, humans will push technology to heights we can't imagine. We'll explore and inhabit space, and occupy more and more of the universe, just as time allowed our ancestors to... multiply in numbers, and populate more and more of the Earth.
...and as the specific people come and go, their physical bodies will be born, and grow, and die... but their thoughts will remain... and Jim Davis' comics, his glorious Garfield comics... are recorded ideas of his, that will still be here.
Even when the Earth is no longer inhabitable, and humanity has long since moved away to bigger planets, they'll carry with them a record, a record we all keep; mark my words... and look at what we've started, what is... What is the internet? What is the online world, if not a record? Never-ending feed of ideas, immortal ideas... forever placed in the ether of dualism.
What is an idea? Where does it live? How does it manifest itself? Can it live forever? Will it live forever, outside of these physical husks of ours, our bodies?
...and Jon Arbuckle, and Garfield, started merely as thoughts... but they've become so much more. That old cliché rings true, they've taken on a life of their own... and life may not be what we think. Life brings to mind a beating heart, breathing lungs, blinking eyes...
...but the real life is in our imaginations... and who better embodies the definition of imagination if not a simple man... a cartoonist, who puts his ideas to paper so that they may live on, so that our children, and our children's children, and their children's children's children can access the wealth of ideas that have accumulated thus far...
They will plug themselves into an information grid, and they will have access... They will read every Garfield comic, 80,000 years from now, a child will see a simple Jon Arbuckle, reading a newspaper. He will feel around for something, but that something is not there... He will lift his head and think...
"Now where could my pipe be?"
...and Garfield will be smoking the pipe, and Jon will yell "GARFIELD!"
...and what then? 80,000 years from now?
The child reading this comic will smile... and that smile will transcend space and time and the physical limitations of this existence, whatever they may be, however many dimensions exist...
There will always be Garfield... and there will always be its creator...

Roll up the history books, burn the chairs
Set fire to anything, set fire to the air
They're hiding to begin and running at the end
'Cause mama said, you take your life in your hands

Taking your life, your life in your hands
But don't take your life in your hands like I did
I don't feel so bad and always look forward with hope
Forward and hope that the children will always be there

Cancel the day, cancel the night
Can't sell the day, can't sell the night
'Cause who could be watching when she steals and runs away
Full of hysterical laughter, and say

Mama, mama
I've left school today
I hope I get to see you in that funny school far away
But those gentlemen in blue and those in grey
Say I'll never, never see mama again

RESERVOIR DOGS
1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING
Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna.
MR. PINK
"Like a Virgin" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick.  The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks.
MR. BLUE
No it's not.  It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--
MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the
tourists.
JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...
MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy.  Now
granted that's what "True Blue" is
about, no argument about that.
MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"
NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of "True
Blue."
MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I
ain't heard of it.  All I asked
was how does it go?  Excuse me
for not being the world's biggest
Madonna fan.
MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.
MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff.  You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.
MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm
making a point here.  You're gonna
make me lose my train
of thought.
JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.
MR. WHITE
What's that?
JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
was her last name?
MR. PINK
Where was I?
MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.
MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick.
MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?
MR. WHITE
A lot.
MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's
like, whoa baby.  This mother
fucker's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape."  He's diggin
tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever.  Pain.
JOE
Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.
MR. PINK
It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
hurts like the first time.  The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."
The fellas crack up.
JOE
Wong?
MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway?  You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.
JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
know, like the Chinese name?
Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.
MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.
JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin?  Give me my book back!
MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.
JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.
MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
know-what, outta my left.
JOE
What do you care?
MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.
JOE
Give me my book.
MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?
JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.
MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.
MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?
MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the
seventies weekend?
MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?
NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they
been playin?
MR. PINK
No, I can't.  You know what I
heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade.
NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it.  And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on.  Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million-
trillion times.  I'm listening to
it this morning, and this was the
first time I ever realized that
the lady singing the song, was the
one who killed Andy.
MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?
NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.
MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before.  I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.
JOE
No, she did it.  She killed the
cheatin wife, too.
MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?"  I could never
figure out what he did.
The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
She has the check, and a pot of coffee.
WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more
coffee.
JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it.
I'll take care of the check.
She hands the bill to him.
WAITRESS
Here ya go.  Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.
JOE
Sure thing.
WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.
They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.
JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.
MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.
JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?
Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
acts shot.  Joe exits.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.
Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.
NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.
MR. WHITE
Uh-uh.  I don't tip.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.
NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?
MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.
MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make?  They make shit.
MR. WHITE
Don't give me that.  She don't
make enough money, she can quit.
Everybody laughs.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that.  So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?
MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta.  I tip when somebody
deserves a tip.  When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds.  As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job.
MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.
MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
anything special.
MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?
They all laugh.
NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.
MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times.  When I order coffee,  I
want it filled six times.
MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?
MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.
They all laugh.
MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death.  They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.
NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--
MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--
NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too.  But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."
MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?
Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.
MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is?  It's
the world's smallest violin,
playing just for the waitresses.
MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what
you're talking about.  These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job.
MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them.  They're servin ya food, you
should tip em.  But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there.  That's
bullshit.
MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.
MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.
MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make.  When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money.
MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country.  It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips.
MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.
They all laugh.
MR. WHITE
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up.  But that ain't
my fault.  it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it.  But what I won't do
is play ball.  And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
"Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise.
MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me.  Give me my
dollar back.
Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.
JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling.  Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?
MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?
MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip?  Why?
MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?
MR. ORANGE
Nope.
JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.
MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the
breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
Normally I wouldn't.
JOE
Whatever.  Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.
The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.

2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY
CREDIT SEQUENCE:
When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:
Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.
Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.
Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:
SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.
Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:
SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry.  I can't believe
she killed me.  Who would've
fuckin thought that?
CUT TO:
3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY
The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the
backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers
both him and the backseat.
Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.
They are the only two in the car.
MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now!  You're hurt.  You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.
MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me.  I'm gonna die, I know
it.
MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine.  Are you
a doctor?  Are you a doctor?
Answer me please, are you a
doctor?
MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!
MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.  So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news.  I'm taking
you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
gonna get you a doctor, the
doctor's gonna fix you up, and
you're gonna be okay.  Now say it:
you're gonna be okay.  Say it:
you're gonna be okay!
Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.
MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
gonna be okay!
MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.
MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.
4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.
Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.
Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.
MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,
and wait for Joe.  I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe
gets here, which should be anytime
now, he'll be able to help you.
We're just gonna sit here, and
wait for Joe.  Who are
we waiting for?
MR. ORANGE
Joe.
MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.
MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!
Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.
MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere.  I'm right
here.  I'm not gonna leave ya.
MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.
Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.
MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've
been brave enough for one day.  I
want you to just relax now.
You're not gonna die, you're gonna
be fine.  When Joe gets here,
he'll make ya a hundred percent
again.
Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's
still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his
friend.
MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
the ointment, but if help doesn't
come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
I don't give a fuck about jail, I
just don't wanna die.
MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?
MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm
hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
MR. WHITE
It's not good...
MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.  I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now.  The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly.  And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.
MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.
MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
about jail.  But I can't die.  You
don't have to take me in.  Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
of myself.  I won't tell them
anything.  I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything.
You'll be safe.
MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--
MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die!   I need a
doctor!  I'm begging you,
take me to a doctor.
Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:
MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.
Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
Pink steps inside.
MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?
Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.
MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.
Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.
MR. WHITE
Gun shot.
MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?
MR. WHITE
Dead.
MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?
MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think?  The
cops shot him.
MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?
MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?
MR. PINK
This is so fucked up.  Somebody
fucked us big time.
MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?
MR. PINK
You even doubt it?  I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up!  I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come
from, huh?  One minute they're not
there, the next minute
they're there.  I didn't hear any
sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time.  Unless a patrol
car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond.  In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there.  All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they
were all just there!  Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm.  but
those other motherfuckers were
already there, they were waiting
for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?
MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there.  And after we
got away, I've just been dealin
with him.
MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it.  In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about.  I
came this close to just driving
off.  Whoever set us up, knows
about this place.  There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me.  For all we know, there's
cops, driving fast, on their way
here now.
MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...
The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
move past it, and see down a hall.
5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY
At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door
is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.
MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here?  I
felt funny about this job right
off.  As soon as I felt it I
should said "No thank you", and
walked.  But I never fucking
listen.  Every time I ever got
burned buying weed, I always knew
the guy wasn't right.  I just felt
it.  But I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lyin to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa
baby.  But it's never Thai stick.
and I always said if I felt that
way about a job, I'd walk.  And I
did, and I didn't, because of
fuckin money!
MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool.  Are you cool?
MR. PINK
I'm cool.
MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.
We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.
MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.
Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries
his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
Chesterfields in his hand.
MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?
MR. PINK
Why not?
The two men light up.
MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened.  We're in the place,
everything's going fine.  Then the
alarm gets tripped.  I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam!  I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--
MR. PINK
--That's not correct.
MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?
MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off.  They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.
MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I
saw the cops.
MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon.  They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there.  But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a
madman.  That's how I know we were
set up.  You can see that,
can't you, Mr. White?
MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--
MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know!  I sure as hell
ain't gonna tell ya
mine.
MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?
MR. PINK
Shot my way out.  Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.
CUT TO:

6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY
Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.
FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with
them.
We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.
Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.
Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.

7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY
The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.
MR. PINK
Get outta the car!  Get the fuck
outta the car!
The Shocked Woman starts screaming.
Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.
MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!
EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.

8      EXT. STREET - DAY
DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.
Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.
The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.
Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.
Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.
Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.
Cops FIRE.

9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY
CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.
BACK TO:

10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY
Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.
MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops.  Did you
kill anybody?
MR. WHITE
A few cops.
MR. PINK
No real people?
MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.
MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?
MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody.  But
if I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.
MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it.  A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker, ain't no choice at
all.  But I ain't no madman
either.  What the fuck was Joe
thinkin?  You can't work with a
guy like that.  That mother-
fucker's unstable.  What do you
think?  Do you think he panicked,
or ya think he's just trigger-
happy?
MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he
didn't tag us, when
he shot up the place.  I came this
fucking close--
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics.  When things get
tense, everybody panics.
Everybody.  I don't care what your
name is, you can't help it.  It's
human nature.  But ya panic on the
inside.
Ya panic in your head.  Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic, then you get a grip and
deal with the situation.  What you
don't do, is shoot up the place
and kill everybody.
MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional.  A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
you think that black girl was?
Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else?
MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
car and Mr. Brown floored it.
After that, I don't know what went
down.
MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest.  Once
I got out, I never looked back.
MR. WHITE
What do you think?
MR. PINK
What do I think?  I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.
MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through?  You found a hole.
MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle.  But if they did get
away, where the fuck are they?
MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--
MR. PINK
Nope.
MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?
MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.
MR. WHITE
Where?
MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?
MR. WHITE
Where?  Are they out in the car?
MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car.  No, I
don't have them on me.  Ya wanna
go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we
can go right now.  But first
listen to what I'm telling you.
We were fuckin set up!  Somebody
is in league with the cops.  We
got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.
MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.
MR. PINK
Then where is everybody?  I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house.  We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could
both be dead
or arrested.  They could be
sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now.  Yeah they don't
know the names, but they can sing
about this place.
I mean, that could be happening
right now.  As we speak, the cops
could be in their cars, drivin
here this minute.
MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.
MR. PINK
What?
MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.
MR. PINK
No shit?
MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing.  Just walked away from it.
MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time?  Mr.
Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's
Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up.  Maybe he set it up to
set it up.
MR. WHITE
I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go
back a long time.  I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.
MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time.  I known Joe since I was a
kid.  But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous.  I can say I
definitely didn't do it, cause I
know what I did or didn't do.  But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know.  For all I know,
you're the rat.
MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.
MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For
all we know, he's the rat.
Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's
expression changes.
MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The
CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him
first.
MR. PINK
Is he dead?
Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse
on Mr. Orange's neck.
MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?
MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.
MR. PINK
So what is it?
MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.
MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta
me.  I thought he was dead fer
sure.
Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.
MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.
MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.
MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this
man won't live through the night.
That bullet in his belly is my
fault.  Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you, it means a
helluva lot to me.  And I'm not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die.
MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy.  We gotta book up.
MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he
bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
he's awake, he screams in pain.
MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.
MR. WHITE
Joe could help him.  If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.
During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a
C.U. of Mr. White.
MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him?  He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here.  Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably
not gonna be that happy with us.
Joe planned a robbery, but he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight.  If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.
MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital.  Now I don't like
turning him over to the cops, but
if we don't, he's dead.  He begged
me to do it.  I told him to hold
off till Joe got here.
MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're
on our own.  Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.
MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.
MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital.  Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.

MR. WHITE'S POV:
C.U. OF MR. PINK.
MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.
MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?
MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and
where I'm from.
There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
then he SCREAMS:
MR. PINK
Why!
MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago.  It was just a casual
conversation.
MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?
MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.
Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.
MR. WHITE (OS)
We had just gotten away from the
cops.  He just got shot.  It was
my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's
a fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming.  I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right
then and there.  I'm tryin to
comfort him, telling him not to
worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna take care of him.  And he
asked me what my name was.  I
mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to
tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
that information, it's against the
rules.  I don't trust you
enough."?  Maybe I shoulda, but I
couldn't.
MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--
MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.
MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?
MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.
MR. PINK
Well that's that, then.  I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already.  But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is,
(i) where you're from and (d) what
your specialty is.
They ain't gonna hafta show him a
helluva lot of pictures for him to
pick you out.  That's it right,
you didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the
selection?
MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to
back off, me an you are gonna go
round and round.
Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.
MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.
MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that.  But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.
MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!
Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
the mouth.
END OF POV
Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of
alley cats.
As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:
MR. WHITE
You little motherfucker!
Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:
MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna
fuck with me?!  I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!
The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.
Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.
Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.
Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.
The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.
MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit?  Take a shot!
MR. PINK
Fuck you, White!  I didn't create
this situation,  I'm just dealin
with it.  You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief.  I'm
actin like a professional.  They
get him, they can get you, they
get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen.  And you,
you motherfucker, are looking at
me like it's my fault.  I didn't
tell him my name.  I didn't tell
him where I was from.  I didn't
tell him what I knew better than
to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen
minutes ago, you almost told me
your name.  You, buddy, are stuck
in a situation you created.  So if
you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.
MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody,
put that gun in your mouth and
shoot yourself.
Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:
VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.

12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE
The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.
Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
and eating a hot dog.
MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought
you might've gotten caught.  What
happened?
Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
place out.
He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.
This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.
Pink tries to talk through it.
We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.
MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?
Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.
MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me,
I found a hole and booked.
Silence.
MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?
Blonde looks in the bathroom.
MR. PINK
We were hopin you two would be
together.
Blonde looks out the window.
MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr.
Blue and you?
Blonde walks away from the window.
MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.
Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.
MR. PINK
He got it in the belly.  He's
still alive, but won't be for
long.
MR. WHITE
Enough!  You better start talkin
to us, asshole, cause we got shit
we need to talk about.  We're
already freaked out, we need you
actin freaky like we need a fuckin
bag on our hip.
Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.
MR. BLONDE
So, talk.
MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the
house.
MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.
MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?
MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?
MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.
MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore.  We're leaving, and you
should go with us.
MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.
Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.
After a few beats the silence is broken.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.
Mr. White turns to leave.
MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr.
White.
Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
Mr. Blonde.
MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac!  It's your
fuckin fault we're in so much
trouble.
Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.
MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?
MR. WHITE
What's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta
problem.  I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who
almost gets me shot!
MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?
MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.
MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.
MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole!  If
I had any idea what type of guy
you were, I never would've agreed
to work with you.
MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?
MR. WHITE
What was that?  I'm sorry, I
didn't catch it.  Would you repeat
it?
MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?
MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional.  You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever
work a job with a bunch of
niggers?  They're just like you
two, always fightin, always sayin
they're gonna kill one another.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you
thought about takin him out.
MR. PINK
Then.  That time has passed.
Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
one I completely trust.  He's too
fuckin homicidal to be workin with
the cops.
MR. WHITE
You takin his side?
MR. PINK
Fuck sides!  What we need is a
little solidarity here.
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
up our asses and we gotta find out
whose hand's on the handle.  Now I
know I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level.  So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.
Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.
Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.
MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you?  Me too.  I don't know
about the rest of you fellas, but
my heart's
beatin fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.
Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.
The other two men just follow him with their eyes.
MR. WHITE
Follow you where?
MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.
MR. WHITE
Why?
MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.
Mr. Blonde walks out.

13     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.
MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.
MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.
MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?
MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.
MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie?  What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?
MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him.  He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.
MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?  Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?
MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.
MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har.  What did he
say?
MR. BLONDE
Stay put.  Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.
Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.
MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.

INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".

14     INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY
We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.
JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it.  You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me.  I don't need to
be told what I already know.  When
you have bad months, you do what
every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.
There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.
JOE
Come in.
One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.
TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.
JOE
Tell him to come in.
Teddy leaves.
JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.
He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
front of the desk.
Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.
Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.
Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.
The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.
JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?
VIC
It's a change.
JOE
Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy
Martin?
VIC
Sure.
JOE
Take a seat.
Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.
JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?
VIC
A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons.
JOE
How is he?
VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.
JOE
Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for
twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger
gets Doris Day as a parole
officer.  But a good fella like
you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
prick.
Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.
Vic swallows some Remy.
VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.
JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do?  Just forget about you?
VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.
JOE
It's the least I could do Vic.  I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a
story?  What're your plans?
VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back
to work.  But I got this Koons
prick deep up my ass.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
My plans have always been to be
part of the team again.
There's a KNOCK at the door.
JOE
Come in.
The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.
EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.
Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.
EDDIE
How ya doin, Toothpick?
VIC
Fine, now.
EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
you up personally at the pen.
This whole week's just been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass the
entire time.
VIC
Funny you should mention it.
That's what your father and I been
talkin about.
EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?
VIC
No.  That your head's been up your
ass.  I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god.  Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing.  Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up."  And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that."  "I'm
ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of
school.  You tell 'im Joe.
Tell 'im yourself.
JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way.  But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.
Eddie bobs his head up and down.
EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?
Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.
The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.
Joe's on his feet yelling at them.
JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over!  You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!
The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.
EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?
JOE
What?
EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.
VIC
You fuckin wish.
EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my
father's office, you sick bastard.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home,
go do it.  But don't try to fuck
me.  I don't think of you that
way.  I mean, I like you a lot--
VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.
EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.
VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch.
You'd be suckin the dick and going
down on a mangy T-bone hound.
EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger.  It's
all that black semen been shootin
up his butt.  It's backed up into
his brain and comes out of his
mouth.
JOE
Are you two finished?  We were
talkin about some serious shit
when you came in Eddie.  We got a
big problem we're tryin to solve.
Now Eddie, would you like to sit
down and help us solve it, or do
you two wanna piss fart around?
Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.
JOE
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.
EDDIE
Really?  Who's your P.O.?
VIC
Craig Koons.
EDDIE
Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.
VIC
He is a motherfucker.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?
VIC
I wanna.  But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-to-
goodness job before he'll let me
move out on my own.  I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.
JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?
EDDIE
This isn't all that bad.  We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.
VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.
EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit.  You
don't really work there.  But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do.  I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy.  You're on the schedule.  You
got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week.  And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad.  So you can move
into a halfway decent place
without Koons thinkin "what the
fuck."  And if Koons ever wants to
make a surprise visit, you're gone
that day.  That day we sent you to
Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there.
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
up a bunch of shit and bringing it
back.  Part of your jab is goin
different places - and we got
places all over the place.
JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.
EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce
you to Matthews, tell him what's
going on.
VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?
JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now.  Things are kinda--
EDDIE
--Nuts.  We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.
JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach.  Give ya some cash, get
that Koons fuck off your back, and
we'll be talking to ya.
EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just
hear it out.  I know you don't
like to use any of the boys on
these jobs, but technically, Vic
ain't one of the boys.  He's been
gone for four years.  He ain't on
no one's list.  Ya know he can
handle himself, ya know you can
trust him.
Joe looks at Vic.
Vic has no idea what they're talking about.
JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?
VIC
What's the exposure like?
JOE
Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough
two minutes.  It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.  But you
have the fellas to deal with the
crowd.  It's a jewelry store.
They're getting a big shipment of
South African diamonds on a
certain day.  They're like a way
station.  It's gonna get picked up
the next day and sent to Hamburg.
When you walk through the door,
you'll know right where to go for
the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice
Guy picked em.  Nobody knows
anybody else.  Nobody's connected.
I don't use connected guys for
this shit.
VIC
What's the cut?
JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.
Toothpick Vic smiles.
So does Nice Guy Eddie.
CUT TO:

15     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are
coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.
EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that.  I gotta
talk with daddy and find out what
he wants done.

FLASH ON
16     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.

17     BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE
EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me.
He said the place turned into a
fuckin bullet festival.  He took a
cop as hostage, just to get the
fuck out of there.

FLASH ON
18     WAREHOUSE
The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.

19     BACK TO EDDIE
EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that.  I
don't know who has the loot, if
anybody has the loot.  Who's dead,
who's alive, who's caught, who's
not...
I will know, I'm practically
there.  But what do I tell these
guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.
CUT TO:

20     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY
Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.
Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.  He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.
EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.
Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.

21     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.
Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.
EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?
Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.
MR. PINK                      MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin
cop.                        on?  Where the fuck is
Joe?
Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.
EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!
MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.
MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.
EDDIE
What?  Nobody set anybody up.
MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!
EDDIE
Bullshit.
MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were.  And I'm tellin
ya, the cops had that store staked
out.
EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?
EDDIE
And what are your answers?  Was it
me?  You think I set you up?
MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.
EDDIE
Nobody did.  You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.
MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?
EDDIE
I ain't talked to him.  I talked
to Dov.  Dov said he's comin out
here, and he's fucking pissed.
MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.
MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?
EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe.  I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.
MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.
EDDIE
I'll call somebody.
MR. WHITE
Who?
EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think.  I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue?
MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.
EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?
MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.
DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.
EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the
cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?
MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.
EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire.  That don't
necessarily make it so.  Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit?  Please tell me somebody
brought something
with them.
MR. PINK
I got a bag.  I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.
EDDIE
Well, let's go get it.  We also
gotta get rid of all those cars.
It looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr.
Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll
pick you up, then we'll pick up
the stones.  And while I'm
following you, I'll arrange for
some sort of a doctor for our
friend.
MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with
him.
Meaning Mr. Blonde.
EDDIE
Why not?
Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.
MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho.  And if you think
Joe's pissed at us, that
ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin
me in the same room as this
bastard.
MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up
with?  As soon as I walk through
the door I'm hit with this shit.
I tell 'm what you told me about
us stayin put and Mr. White whips
out his gun, sticks it in my face,
and starts screaming "You
motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
away, blah, blah, blah."
MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.
MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he
went crazy in the store.
MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.
Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.
MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it.  I blew 'em full
of holes.  If they hadn't done
what I told 'em not it, they'd
still be alive.
MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?
MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.
EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop?  We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody.
You should've never took him outta
your trunk in the first place.
MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.
EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news.  Blondie,
you stay here and take care of
them two.  White and Pink come
with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
sees all those fucking cars
parked out front, he's going to be
as mad at me as he is at you.
Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.

22     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP
Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly
turns his head towards the cop.
MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.

C.U. COP'S FACE.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?
COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up.  I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything!
I don't know anything!  You can
torture me if you want--
MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.
COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss.
Are you clear about that?
He SLAPS the cop's face.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
I asked you a question.  Are you
clear about that?
COP
Yes.
MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you.  I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know.  I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but
because torturing a cop amuses me.
There's nothing you can say,
there's nothing you can do.
Except pray for death.
He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.

COP'S POV
Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.
MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.
He turns on the radio.
Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.
NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.
Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.
He opens a large knife.
He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
in it.
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
the knife, singing along with the song.
Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.
A SLASH across the face.
The cop/camera moves around wildly.
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.
Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.
The cop/camera moves around wildly.
Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.
Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
of the way.

23     INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT
We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...
...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.
He walks back inside the warehouse...

24     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
...carrying the can of gas.
Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.
Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.
Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:
MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right.  Here I am,
stuck in the middle with you."
He moves the match up to the cop...
...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.
The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.
We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.
Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.
Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.
When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.
MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?
COP
Jeffrey.
MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?
COP
Jeffrey Andrews.
MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey
Andrews.  I'm a cop.
JEFFREY
I know.
MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?
JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.
MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.
JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.
MR. ORANGE
Shit.  I don't remember that at
all.
JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?
The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.
MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey starts to weep.
JEFFREY
That fucking bastard!  That
fucking sick fucking bastard!
MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.
JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting
for?  That motherfucker cut off my
ear!  He slashed my face!  I'm
deformed!
MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying.  They don't know
that.  All they know is they're
not to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up.  I was sent undercover
to get Cabot.  You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way.  Don't pussy
out on me now, Jeffrey.  We're
just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head
through that door.
CUT TO:

INSERT: TITLE CARD  "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"

25     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all
alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he
practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
likes it.
We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
across his face.
CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker
who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job
and take a big fat guess who he
wants on the team?
HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.
LOW ANGLE
looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.
FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.
CU ON HOLDAWAY
Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
smiles.
HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.

26     EXT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.

27     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY
We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me.  He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call.  Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.
The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to
speed and says:
HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?
From here to end we cut back and forth.
FREDDY
Nice Guy.  When we got to the
bar...
HOLDAWAY
...What bar?
FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony
name.  My name's Mr. Orange.
HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?
FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY
Yeah.
FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town.
But Joe knows him real well.
HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?
FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.
HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?
FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?
HOLDAWAY
Yeah.
FREDDY
A little.
HOLDAWAY
What about?
FREDDY
The Brewers.
HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?
FREDDY
Yeah.  They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.
HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.
Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.
HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot
ask?
FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how
I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.
Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.
FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before.  I read him my
credits.  I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.
CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.
HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?
FREDDY
Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good,
too.

28     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.
FREDDY
What's this?
HOLDAWAY
It's a scene.  Memorize it.
FREDDY
What?
HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando.  To do this job you
got to be a great actor.  You got
to be naturalistic.  You got to be
naturalistic as hell.  If you
ain't a great actor you're a bad
actor, and bad acting is bull shit
in this job.
FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?
HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.
FREDDY
What?
HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.
FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?
HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke.  You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own.  The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
and sayin it, and sayin it.
FREDDY
I can do that.
HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details.  It's the details
that sell your story.  Now this
story takes place in this men's
room.  So you gotta know the
details about this men's room.
You gotta know they got a blower
instead of a towel to dry your
hands.  You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors.  You gotta
know whether they got liquid or
powdered soap, whether they got
hot water or not, 'cause if you do
your job when you tell your story,
everybody should believe it.  And
if you tell your story to somebody
who's actually taken a piss in
this men's room, and you get one
detail they remember right,
they'll swear by you.

29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but
he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
while he stumbles over his words.
FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86.  I still
had a connection.  Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,
I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it.  And
they'd give me a call and say,
"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?"
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin.  But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people.  Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this
bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people.  I was fuckin
doin all the work.  So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I
get my pot for free."  So, I did
if for awhile...
Freddy exits frame
CUT TO:

30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY
Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.
FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass.  People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time.  I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know."  And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still.  I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth.  They want ten
dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around.  If I have that much
around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out.  But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it.  And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything.  People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months.  And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it.  So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore.  But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends.  She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend.  She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...
CUT TO:

31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT
Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his
story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.
FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.
MR. WHITE
What for?
FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took
'im to jail.  She doesn't want to
walk around alone with all that
weed.  Well, I don't wanna do
this, I have a bad feeling about
it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
askin me, finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of listening to
it.  Well, we're picking this guy
up at the train station.
JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station?  You're carrying
the weed on you?
FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right
away.  Don't ask me why.  So we
get to the train station, and
we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm
carrying the weed in one of those
carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
piss.  So I tell the connection
I'll be right back, I'm goin' to
the little boys room...
CUT TO:

32     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY
MEDIUM ON FREDDY
He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We
move into a CU.
FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?
FREEZE FRAME
on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are
on Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.
FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.
NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?
FREDDY (V.O.)
No.  They were just a bunch of
cops hangin out in the men's room,
talkin.  When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.

33     BACK TO BAR
ECU MR. WHITE
MR. WHITE
That's hard, man.  That's a fuckin
hard situation.

34     BACK TO MEN'S ROOM
ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD
barking his head off.
FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts
barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I
mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
me.
We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can
hear the dog barking.
FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!"  Panic hit
me like a bucket of water.  First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face!  Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.
SLOW MOTION
CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.
FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can
smell it.  As sure as that fuckin
dog cam, they can smell it on me.
FREEZE FRAME
Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
front of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and
moves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One
sheriff yells at the dog.
SHERIFF #1
Shut up!
The dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.
A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.
SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right?  I got
it aimed right at him.  I tell
'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
And the little idiot's lookin at
me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
"I know...I know...I know."
Meanwhile his right hand is
creepin towards his glove box.  So
I scream at him, "Asshole, you
better fuckin freeze right now!"
And he's still lookin right at me,
saying
"I know...I know...I know."  And
his right hand's still going for
the glove box.
The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.
SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face right now if
you don't put your hands on the
fuckin dash."  And the guy's
girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
bitch, starts screamin at him,
"Chuck, are you out of your mind?
Put your hands on the dash like
the officer said."  And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.
Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.
A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.
SHERIFF #1
What was he goin for?
SHERIFF #2
His registration.  Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the
slightest idea how close he came
to gettin shot.
Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,
but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns
on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the
sheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the
sound track.
These following shots are SLOW MOTION.
CU OF FREDDY
CU of his HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry
SHOT OF SHERIFFS talking.  We can't hear them because of
the machine.

FULL SCENE
An office upstairs in the undercover division of the
police station.

TWO SHOT OF FREDDY AND HOLDAWAY
look at mug shot.
HOLDAWAY
Lawrence Dimick.  Let's see what
we got on him.
CU OF COMPUTER SCREEN
the name DIMICK, LAWRENCE is typed in.

C.U. ENTER BUTTON IS PRESSED

C.U. OF FEMALE COMPUTER OPERATOR, JODIE SEIGEL.
JODIE
This is your life, Lawrence
Dimick!

C.U. OF COMPUTER PRINTER
printing out sheet.  The noise of the printer plays loud
over the soundtrack. Jodie's hand comes into FRAME and
tears sheet from the printer.
CUT TO:

36     INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY
Holdaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of
the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look
into the CAMERA.
We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.
JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick.  Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery.  He's
a pro and he makes it a habit not
to get caught.

MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE
DOLLY slowly into C.U.
JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime.  Once for
armed robbery, when he was twenty-
one, in Milwaukee.

C.U. FREDDY
FREDDY
What was it?

JODIE
JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard.
First offense - he got eighteen
months.  He didn't get busted
again until he was thirty-two.
And then it was a backdoor bust.
A routine vice squad roust.  They
roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence
is in there knocking down a few.
He gets picked up.  He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45
automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice.  Also, on his finger is
a diamond ring from a jewelry
store robbery a year earlier.  He
got two years back inside for
that.

TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY
Freddy winces.
FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.

JODIE
JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's
ever done.

CU HOLDAWAY
HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?

JODIE
JODIE
No.  The vice squad roust was in
L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles
since '77.

DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK
from left to right.
FREDDY
When did he do this time?
JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86.  I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of.
About a year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop,
John Dolenz, worked his way into a
bank job.  Apparently before the
job they found out he was a cop.
Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party.  The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.
HOLDAWAY
What happened?
The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.
JODIE
It was a mess.  Cops got hit,
wives got hit, girlfriends got
hit, his dog got hit.  People got
glass in their faces.  Three were
killed, six were wounded.
FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?
JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis.  Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them.  We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking
about committing a robbery.  They
never went ahead with the bank
job.
The DOLLY completes its circle.
FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?
JODIE
He was probably the one.

ON HOLDAWAY
HOLDAWAY
Just how sure are you with your
cover?
PAN to C.U. on Freddy.
FREDDY
Today they may know something,
tomorrow they may know something
else.  But yesterday they didn't
know anything.

C.U. OF MR. WHITE'S MUG SHOT
FREDDY (OS)
What's the next step?
HOLDAWAY (OS)
Do what they told ya.  Sit in your
apartment and wait for 'em to call
you.  We'll have guys posted
outside who'll follow you when
they pick you up.

35     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.
EDDIE
He'll be right down.

39     INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the
apartment getting everything he needs.  He puts on
his jacket and slips on some sneakers.
DOLLY fast toward the front door knob.  Freddy's hand
comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go.  We MOVE
UP to his face.
Fear.
FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now.  They
don't know.  They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt.  You're
fucking Baretta and they believe
every word, cuz
you're super cool.
He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and
close OFF SCREEN.

40     EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
COPS' POV
From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO
COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and
up to Eddie's parked car.
COP #1 (OS)
There goes our boy.
COP #2 (OS)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks
in his head the size of Gibraltar
to work undercover.
COP #1 (OS)
Do you want one of these?
COP #2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.
Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.
Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.

41     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is
in the passenger seat.  Freddy and Mr. White are in the
backseat together.
MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.
MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.
The car laughs.
MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what
I mean.  What a while bitch will
put up with, a black bitch won't
put up with for a minute.  They
got a line, and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.
EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this.  I've seen it happen.
MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
a truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?
MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those
same damn niggers who were showin
their ass in public, when their
bitches get 'em home, they chill
the fuck out.
MR. WHITE
Not these guys.
MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.
EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story.  In
one of daddy's clubs there was
this black cocktail waitress named
Elois.
MR. WHITE
Elois?
EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We
called her Lady E.
MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?
EDDIE
No.  She was from Ladora Heights.
MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills.  I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights
once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once.  You know
who she looked like?  Christie
Love.  'Member that TV show "Get
Christie Love"?  She was a black
female cop.  She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."
MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on.  I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie
Love?
EDDIE
Pam Grier.
MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one.  Pan Grier made
the movies.  Christie Love was
like a Pam Grier TV show, without
Pam Grier.
MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's
name?  Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.
EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her.  So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?"  Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit.  I
mean a real animal.  And
apparently he would so things to
her.
FREDDY
Do things?  What would he do?  You
mean like beat her up?
EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch.  So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly.
The car reacts to how horrible that would be.
EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together.
The paramedics had to come and cut
it loose.
The car reacts badly.
MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!
FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.
EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.
MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?
MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to
do a handstand every time you took
a piss.
The car laughs.

42     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.

43     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
The four men enter the building.
At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.
We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.
JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how
they get their wives off, and the
French guys says:
(in a bad French
accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la  and she rises a foot off the
bed."
Back to Joe.
So the dago says:

CU ON JOE
JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin.  When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little
fun pimple, she rises two feet off
da bed."  Then our friend from
Poland says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what?  She hits the
roof!"
Joe laughs like a crazy man.
JOE
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.
JOE
Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.
Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.
JOE
You're here, great!
Joe EXITS C.U.
We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
the right.
We do a 360 around the men.
EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea
and Pico.
JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another.  With the exception of
Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed.  You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done.  Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do.  This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself.  And that's the way I like
it.  Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with.  You don't
know any names.  You know my name,
you know Eddie's name.  That I
don't care about.  You gotta prove
it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
this way you gotta trust me.  I
like that.  I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you.  I know
you.  I know your work, I know
your reputation.  I know you as
men.  Except for this guy.
Joe points a finger at Freddy.
Freddy shits a brick.
JOE
But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you.
Okay, quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
Pink.
MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?
JOE
Cause you're a faggot.
Everybody laughs.
MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?
JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down.  So forget it,
I pick.  Be thankful you're not
Mr. Yellow.
MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too
close to Mr. Shit.
Everybody laughs.
MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.
JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.
MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is?  Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta
cool-sounding name.  So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?
JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting!  Listen up
Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here,
my way or the highway.  And you
can go down either of 'em.  So
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget
it.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.
CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
with the layout of the jewelry store on it.
JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.
CUT TO:

44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.
HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry.  But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control.  You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in.  You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle.  We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous.  They got
complete visibility of the
exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.
FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?
HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.
FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.
HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job
too tough for ya?  No one lied to
you.  You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.
FREDDY
Oh this is great.  You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever.  But you are giving me
an attitude.
HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection?  Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now.  I understand
you're nervous.  I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't.  We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.
FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!
HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations.  We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards.  We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.
FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?
HOLDAWAY
What?
FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?
HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed.  We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean.  We got people
surrounding the perimeter.  We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings.  We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.
FREDDY
That's out.  They know the faces
of who works what shift.
HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals.  It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.

45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY
We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.
CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.
While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it.  Where are you?
FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door.  I don't let anybody come in
or go out.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?
FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control.  They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.

46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY
Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.
MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?
FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds.  We're there for those
stones, period.  Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off.  We're out
of there in two minutes, not one
second longer.  What if the
manager won't give up the
diamonds?
MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass.  They're not supposed to give
you and resistance
whatsoever.  If you get a customer
or an employee who thinks he's
Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in.
Drops 'em right to the floor.
Everyone jumps, he falls down,
screaming, blood squirts out his
nose.  Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after
that.  You might get some bitch
talk shit to ya.  But give her a
look, like you're gonna smash her
in the face next.  Watch her shut
the fuck up.  Now if it's a
manager, that's a different story.
The managers know better than to
fuck around.  So if one's givin
you static, he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy.  So what you
gotta do is break that son-of-a-
bitch in two.  If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers.  The
little one.  Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next.  After that he'll
tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get
a taco.
CUT TO:

47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY
It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.
In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...
A car whips around the corner, into the alley.
The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.
Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.
MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!
FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.
Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.
FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.
Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.
Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.
MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?
By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.
Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.
MR. WHITE
Is he dead?
Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.
MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?
Freddy, scared.
FREDDY
I'm sorry.
MR. WHITE
What?  Snap out of it!
Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.
They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.
A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.
Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points
his jun at her.
MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!
Mr. White climbs into the backseat.
Freddy starts to climb in.
The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.
MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!
She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.
On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.

C.U. ON FREDDY
as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.
Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

48     INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.
We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.
MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.
FREDDY
I'm sorry.  I can't believe she
killed me...

CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:

49     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the
diamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is
SPEEDING back to the garage.
EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.
MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said
that.
EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with?  There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.
MR. PINK
I love this guy.
EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done.  We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.
MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel.  You and Joe have
a responsibility to your men.
EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.
MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.
EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
take care of him.
MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.
EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.
MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.
EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out.  If not,
listen how it is.  I called three
doctors and couldn't get through
to shit.  Now, time being a
factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet
broad, helluva broad, and a
registered nurse.  Told her a
bullshit story, upside:  she said
bring him to her apartment.
MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.
EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you
wanna play that way.  I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation.  I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know
for sure.  But me being too nice-
a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
it.  But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his
portable phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it.  You take care
of your friend, you know so much
about it.
MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!
EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my
friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm
being responsible, I'm taking care
of business.
MR. WHITE
Cut the shit!  I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes.  And I
don't think that's good enough
care for a gut-shot man.
EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!
MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him.  She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is
something we're doing in the
meantime.  I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.
EDDIE
Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.

50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.
We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a
bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
shot.
EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?
Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.
MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?
MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and
was gonna burn him alive.
EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?
Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and
the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
once more.
EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that?  Worse or
better?
MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.
MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit was a
stone cold psycho.
MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him.  He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.
EDDIE
I don't buy it.  It doesn't make
sense.
MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.
Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.
MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.
EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you.  Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram.  That's your story?
I'm correct about that, right?
MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth.  I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.
The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.
There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
has said.  Finally:
EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar.  Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?
MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.
MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
not above pullin a fast one.  Get
rid of Blonde, we share his split
- no, scratch that, I shot him
'cause I didn't like his hair
style.  I didn't like his shoes
either.  If it has just been his
hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
let him live.  But hair and
footwear together, he's a goner.
EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison.  He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items.  He could've walked
away.  All he had to do was say my
dad's name.  But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time.  He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man.  And we were very
grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's
just gonna decide, right out of
the fuckin blue, to rip us off?
Silence.
EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?
VOICE (OS)
Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.
Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.
JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
This man set us up.
CAMERA does a 360 around the men.
EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.
JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?
JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
That piece of shit.  Workin with
the cops.
MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE
What?
JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.

MR. ORANGE'S POV
Looking up from the floor at everybody.
Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.
JOE
Aren't you?
MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.
MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.
JOE
Like hell I am.
MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake.  He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're
super-fuckin pissed.  We're all
real emotional.  But you're
barking up the wrong tree.  I know
this man, and he wouldn't do that.
JOE
You don't know jack shit.  I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue killed.
MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?
JOE
Dead as Dillinger.
EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.
MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?
JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on.  I should have
my fucking head examined for goin
forward when I wasn't a hundred
percent.  But he seemed like a
good kid, and I was impatient and
greedy and all the things that
fuck you up.
MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?
JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct.  I ignored it before,
but not no more.
He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.
Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.
Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
firearms.
Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.
EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!
Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.
MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.
EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!
Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.
JOE
Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot.  We like each
other too much.
MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next.  Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!
We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.

MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY
Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.
Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off
him.
Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
start firing any minute.
Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.
Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.
Nobody says nothing.

FOUR SHOT
of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.
MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!
Joe raises his head to Mr. White.
JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!
JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
on this.
MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.
JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.
Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.
EDDIE
Daddy, don't!
Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.
Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.
Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.
Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.
The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.
Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.
Joe's dead.
Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.
Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
not moving.
Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.
We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:
POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!
MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!
We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.
While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.
He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.
MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're
gonna do a little time.
Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
effort:
MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.
Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.
MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.
The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.
The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see
anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.
POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your
fucking gun!
Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.
BANG
We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.
Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it 

I'm not afraid of the dark, but I'm afraid of my heart
And I'm afraid that everything is gonna fall apart
Always afraid that things will never get better
I went from writing down rhymes to typing suicide letters
Diagnosed with paranoia, you can check my prescription
I'm a manic depressive, one of my many conditions
I'm not a prophet or a sayer, but I'm seeing a vision
My life, it was beyond it on a one-way collision
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm devoid of any sorrows
'Cause I don't wanna know the outcome of today or tomorrow
I just wanna hide inside my own private Hell
How can I ever get to Heaven, when so many angels fell
I'm just a human being, I'm just only being human
With eternity and judgement from another always looming
It's a wonder that I made it with these voices in my head
With all these monsters at my window, staring at me in my bed

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

Put me out my misery, permanently no injury
I'm tired of fighting entities, I'm running out of energy
Feel like a lost boy, searching for the answers
Just waitin' on tragedy, a heart attack or even cancer
So many monsters hiding, waiting round the corner for us
If life is like a song, I'm at the verse and searching for the chorus
Maybe I should stop and take a moment, put it in perspective
Maybe I should take a knife and take a life and get injected
I just wanna go out on my own fucking terms
Knowing it was me that put me in the dirt and with the worms
I think I'll pop another pill, try to heal the ill
Wash it down with gasoline, light a match and that's for real
But I'll just probably go to sleep and try to clear my head
Hiding from these monsters at my window, underneath my bed

Monster, how should I feel?

Let me off, screeching halt, concussion blinding, not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks, ayy, ayy
By any means necesserated, blade cut me, sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague spreaded faceless, lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus, christo anti-clan of shameless
Came to whip those into shapeless, here we go, devastated
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror? Who's at the door?
Someone's there, wasn't there before
Ceiling connected to the chord
Pull it, pull that shit (Pull that shit)
Pull that shit, pull that shit
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the diamonds, scrapin', sidin'
Wastin' my life in altered states, them, back it up
I got the fever, I got the fever
I got the fever, I got the fever

Get up
Beats 'bout waist deep
Swallowed by beats
I stay niche
I've seen footage
What's that? Can't tell
Handheld dream shot in hell
Deep space ghetto streets (Streets, streets)
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Mystery 'hind that death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
What's the science of flyin' that high?
Got a no-no goin' one time
Creeps up behind me
Over my shoulder
Turn around, try to see, but it's nowhere
Noided, noided, static on my blindside
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)

Who captures life
Who takes what's left, who stay
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you
Don't touch me
What's up with it
(I stay noided) Stimulation overload account for it
Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit
(I've seen) I've seen it, I've been it
Can't delete it, feels like jail (Noided)
Full Moon in the klink
Shining, don't sleep
Surveillance post my bail

I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)

On some kid who stepped so
Fast was hard to grasp what even happened
'Til you seen that head blow
Off his shoulders in slow-mo
Rewind that, it's so cold (Noided)
Rewind that, it's so cold (Noided)
I've seen footage, I stay noided
Juke step with so much boy-rude looseness
Seem like no bones in him skin (Noided)
My jaw hit the floor, like "This real footage
Gotta see that one mo' 'gain"
(I stay) Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil
Little tiger, boy soldier
Twist cap back and kill (Noided)
Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit

HOUSE: Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What’s wrong with them?  I’m not going to like you, am I?
KEEN: Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.
HOUSE: Statistically, you’re right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That’s six legs. So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. 
CARING: What were they doing when pain presented?
HOUSE: I have no idea. 
REBELLIOUS: You didn’t ask? You didn’t take a history?
HOUSE: Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened. Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence.  Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control.  Person B, volleyball practice.  Coach figured it was a pulled muscle. And C,  we’ve got Carmen Electra. Golfing. 
KEEN: Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?
House: The Baywatch thespian. And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer.  Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which?  Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

HOUSE: Did you hike to the fence, and how far?
FARMER: Yes, it’s about half a mile from my farmhouse.
HOUSE: And where’s the pain localized?
FARMER: It started just above my ankle and it’s radiating up.
House: So, what should we do first? 
KEEN: Family history?
House: Indicative of leg pain? That’s a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? 
CARING: Could be a blood issue. We should run a CBC and a D-dimer. 
REBELLIOUS: And get an MRI.
CARING: MRI or a PET scan?
REBELLIOUS: If the problem’s vascular, he’s better off –
HOUSE: Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him. 
KEEN: We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!
HOUSE: You had time to look at the leg. 

CARING: I thought we were starting with the farmer’s case first.
HOUSE: We are. But if we’re going to look at a leg…

HOUSE: I need you to take off your pants.  Puncture.

CARING: Snakebite.
HOUSE: That would be my guess.
REBELLIOUS: Farmer didn’t know he had been bit by a snake?
HOUSE: That’s what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.
KEEN: What kind of snake?
HOUSE: You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
KEEN: How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don’t know what kind of snake it is?
HOUSE: Oh, there are people to find those things out.

CHASE: Shouldn’t we wait for the Humane Society or something?
Foreman: The guy might only have a couple of hours. 

HOUSE: And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?

CAMERON: You have tendonitis.

CARING: How old is this person? I mean, it’s not really a 40-year-old man on a girls’ volleyball team, right?
HOUSE: It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.
CARING: Well, I was just worried that –
HOUSE: Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
KEEN: Obviously we should care about our patients no matter what age –
HOUSE: Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She’s mine, stay away.  Would you operate on your mother?
CARING: Of course not. I’d be too nervous; couldn’t be objective.
HOUSE: Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family? The actual patient is 16. Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.

CAMERON: I need to know everything about you. 

CAMERON: I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson’s, or any other degenerative condition. But there’s this boy at school, and he’s on the boys’ volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won’t call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn’t like her and never did.
HOUSE: You got all this from an examination of the knee?
CAMERON: I think she’s depressed.
HOUSE: She doesn’t have tendoni—
CAMERON: She has tendonitis.
HOUSE: She’s depressed about having tendonitis.
CAMERON: She’s depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.
HOUSE: Not the boy.
CAMERON: No, the boy’s a jerk, she knows that, and yet she’s depressed. I found a nodule.
HOUSE: Ah. Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.
CAMERON:  I’ll run the tests.

CARING: So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.
HOUSE: No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.


HOUSE: Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.

CARMEN: Can I put my pants back on now?
HOUSE: I’d rather you didn’t. 
CARING: Which Carmen Electra is this?
HOUSE: First one. The golfer. 
KEEN: Then why isn’t she wearing pants? 
HOUSE:  You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? 
REBELLIOUS: Slipped disc?
HOUSE: Could be. How bad does it hurt?
CARMEN:  It hurts really, really bad.
HOUSE: Yeah?
CARING: It doesn’t seem real. Is she the one faking?
HOUSE: Oh, for God’s sake. She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep.  Fine. 
LATE 30s MAN: What the hell is wrong with me?  Do something! 
CARING: Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root. 
KEEN: Or it could be referred pain from his groin.
HOUSE: Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? 
KEEN: He’s curling; it’s not the back.
HOUSE: Sir, where are you getting pain?
LATE 30s MAN: Help me!
HOUSE: Oooh.
REBELLIOUS: He’s not going to tell us anything if we don’t get him out of pain. Give him 50mg of Demerol.
CARING: We have no history, he could be allergic.
HOUSE:  What do I do?
REBELLIOUS: We can’t diagnose him while he screams.
CARING: Better than killing him with pain killers, then – 
HOUSE: Apparently, he’s not allergic.
LATE 30s MAN: Thank you, I feel a lot better now. 

CARING: We screwed up.
HOUSE: No, you did exactly what his attending did.
REBELLIOUS: And that was the proper way to handle the case?
HOUSE: Yeah.
REBELLIOUS: The guy used him as a dealer!
HOUSE: You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm…

CHASE:  Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

CAMERON: Four vials of the CroFab antivenin. Hey, how you doing?
FARMER: All right.
CAMERON:  Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast.  He’s having an allergic reaction, bag.  Paddles and epi.
NURSE: But his heart’s fine—
CAMERON: It’s not going to stay that way.  Paddles!

HOUSE: What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. 

WILSON: You didn’t think she was going to get married?
HOUSE: She asked me the same question.
WILSON: And… what? You’re not gonna treat him?
HOUSE: There’s probably nothing wrong with him.
Wilson: Oh, sure, that makes sense. She’s just using the old “sick husband” routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she’d be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.
HOUSE: So I should help her because she hates me.
WILSON: She doesn’t hate you. She loves you, she just can’t stand to be around you. 
KEEN: Uh, Dr. House? It’s been almost six minutes.

KEEN: Found him.
HOUSE: The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.
REBELLIOUS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don’t really care about the volleyball player.
HOUSE: What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
REBELLIOUS: Really?
HOUSE: No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.
REBELLIOUS: You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.
HOUSE: No, I didn’t. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.

CAMERON: We’re going to start you on Thyroxin. It’ll make you feel better and level your moods.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Thank you. 

REBELLIOUS: So, that’s it?
HOUSE: You were right the first time. Snakebite guy’s way more interesting. Gross, actually.


FOREMAN: The patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested. Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.
CHASE: Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.
FOREMAN: He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it’s a timber rattlesnake.
HOUSE:  No, it’s not. Notice the volume?
FOREMAN: I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.
HOUSE: 200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.

KEEN: We’re supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?
HOUSE: Nope. Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?
CARING: He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.
HOUSE: Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.
CARING: So we give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Is that a question?
KEEN: Well, we can’t just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?
HOUSE: Very good.
KEEN: We’ve gotta find the right snake.
HOUSE: No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.
KEEN: But you said –
CARING: So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.
HOUSE: Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin?  And who goes looking for the snake?
REBELLIOUS: I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.
HOUSe: That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
CARING: So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.
HOUSE: Yeah.
KEEN: But we can’t be blamed for –
HOUSE: I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay. It’s much simpler than that. It’s just plain wrong.

HOUSE:  We gave the guy the antivenin.
FARMER: What if I’m allergic again?
FOREMAN: That’s why these people are here. If you have a reaction, we’re ready to do whatever’s necessary to ensure your airway stays open and your heart keeps beating.
FARMER: My wife’s on her way in, can’t this wait?
FOREMAN: I’m sorry, it can’t. [He begins to inject the serum, and nothing happens. House nods, and leaves the room to be confronted by the Late 30s Man.
LATE 30s MAN: It hurts again.

CARING: He came back?
HOUSE:  On average, drug addicts are stupid.
REBELLIOUS: I’d call the cops.
HOUSE: Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn’t risk their careers on a hunch.
REBELLIOUS: It’s not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.
HOUSE: I believe drug addicts get sick. Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts. Luckily, you don’t have to play your hunch, there’s a faster way. Actually, there are several. My preference is urine testing.
REBELLIOUS: But you already know he has drugs in his system.
HOUSE: That’s not what I’m testing for.

HOUSE: We’re going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable.
LATE 30s MAN: Shouldn’t I be getting some kind of anesthetic? 
HOUSE: We’re concerned about allergic reactions today.

HOUSE: If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he’s really sick.
REBELLIOUS: Or he’s really jonesing.
HOUSE: There’s easier ways to get a hold of drugs. Other hospitals, for example.  The volleyball player is not responding to treatment.  At least we think it’s not working on account of the fact she’s getting worse. Can you still hear me?
REBELLIOUS: No.
CARING: A little.
KEEN: Not really!
HOUSE:  Well, if you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?

CAMERON: I’m sorry. What did I do?
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: I don’t know. It really hurts!
CAMERON: I promise to be very careful.  Susan!

HOUSE: Not her real name!

CAMERON: Susan, I barely touched you! 
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Aaaah! No, it hurts so much!
CAMERON: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I have to get this blood. Just hold on.

CAMERON: Hypersensitivity to touch.
CHASE: Her calcium up?
CAMERON: Lab over 16.
HOUSE: The question is why. Likely suspects?
CHASE: Parathyroid adenoma.
CAMERON: Kidney problems.
FOREMAN: Vit. D intoxification.
CHASE: Hyperthyroid.
FOREMAN: Caused by our treatment?

CARING: Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? 
HOUSE:  The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH –

HOUSE: -- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that’s enough about the volleyball player. What’s up with the farmer? 
FOREMAN: What farmer?
HOUSE: Snakebite guy. Oh, right, you guys don’t know about him. He doesn’t get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player. Luckily, it’s been well established that time is not a fixed construct.  His condition’s not improving; double the dosage.
FOREMAN: Already did.
HOUSE: There’s another antivenin, it’s not as effective, but –
CHASE: Already tried it.
HOUSE: The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to –
CAMERON: Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing’s working.
HOUSE:  What does it all mean?

CARING: Wrong snake?
HOUSE: We tried every other antivenin we had.
CARING: We’re too late?
HOUSE: Yep. He’s dying. His wife’s here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I’m kidding.
CARING: He’s not dying?
HOUSE: Oh, yeah, he’s dying, but there’s no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the “breaking the news” thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.


HOUSE: The drug addict is peeing blood.

HOUSE: How do they teach you how to tell someone that they’re dying? It’s kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down. Do you roleplay and stuff?
KEEN: Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.
HOUSE: And what do you have to do to get an A in You’re Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks every time somebody says “Thank you.” Imagine that. This guy’s so good, people thank him for telling them that they’re dying.  Eh, needs brown. I don’t get thanked that often.

HOUSE: You’re dying. In a few hours. There’s nothing we can do except deal with the pain.
FARMER: Well, I need to go home.
HOUSE: You’re not going home.
FARMER: Well, my dog? What will happen to my dog?

CAMERON: Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

REBELLIOUS: Wait, wait, wait. The guy’s dying and all he cares about is his dog?
HOUSE: Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It’s a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they’re dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they’re willing to die for. What they’re willing to lie for.

HOUSE: Well, you must have a neighbor who –
FARMER: The neighbors don’t like him.
HOUSE: Then the Humane Society can take him in and –
FARMER: No, they won’t. Maybe my aunt –
HOUSE: It wasn’t a snakebite, was it?
FARMER: I said I don’t remember being bit.
HOUSE: Sure you do. Just not by a snake. I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors awhile back. You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it. Cujo’s got a record, he gets the chair. The good news is, you might just live. The bad news is, your dog’s gonna die.

CHASe: The guy risked his life to save this thing?
FOREMAN: I’ll hold him, you swab the mouth.
CHASE: I think I’ve got a better grip here, you go for the mouth.  All right, I’m odds.
FOREMAN: What, are you serious?
CHASE: Come on.
FOREMAN: One, two, three! 
CHASE: I don’t care if he’s scratching your nads off, don’t let go.
FOREMAN: Just do it! 
CHASE: I say we let the guy die.
FOREMAN: I got his head, just do it!

HOUSE: What would you call that? That’s tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs… what’s the differential diagnosis for urine that’s tea-colored?
CARING: Kidney stone.
HOUSE: Kidney stones would cause what?
CARING: Blood in urine.
HOUSE: What color is your pee?
CARING: Yellow.
HOUSE: What color is your blood?
CARING: Red.
HOUSE: What colors did I use?
CARING: Red, yellow and brown.
HOUSE: And brown. What causes brown?
CARING: Wastes.
HOUSE: Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?
CARING: Trauma.
HOUSe: None that his history would indicate.
CARING: Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.
HOUSE: Treatment?
CARING: Heat and rest –
HOUSE: Other possible causes.
CARING: Infection.
HOUSE: Start him on antibiotics. What else?  Come on, come on!
CARING: I – I don’t know.
HOUSE: You’re useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?
REBELLIOUS: The trauma diagnosis is right. He takes it easy for a few days, he’ll be fine.
HOUSE: You sure?
REBELLIOUS: The elevated CK rules out infection –
HOUSE: You know what’s worse than useless? Useless and oblivious.  What are they missing?
KEEN: You know, it’s kind of hard to think when you’re in our face like this –
HOUSE: Yeah? You think it’s going to be easier when you’ve got a real patient really dying?  What are you missing?]
CAMERON:  Muscle death.
HOUSE: Not your case.
CAMERON: Nothing wrong with a consult.
CARING: Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It’s toxic to the kidneys.
HOUSE: Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what’s killing it.


REBELLIOUS: Why is the girl getting the MRI?
HOUSE: Because the neck scan revealed nothing and her doctor’s way more obsessive than she thinks she is. 
REBELLIOUS: But you said the guy needed the MRI.
HOUSE: Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it! Not one of this guy’s doctors said it. They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.
CARING: Did he get better?
HOUSE: No.
CARING: Well, how long –
HOUSE: Three days. It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up. You are gonna kill someone. If you can’t handle that reality, pick another profession. Or finish medical school and teach.
CARING: Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?
HOUSE: No, three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death.

CAMERON: The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma: a cancerous tumor in your femur. It needs to be removed surgically. With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival. But I have to warn you, depending on how large the tumor is, and how ingrained it is, the surgeon may need to amputate your leg. I’m sorry.
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER'S MOTHER: It’s okay.

FOREMAN: Well, dogs’ mouths are pretty filthy, but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff. We don’t. That’s why dog bites can be so nasty. The lab test of your dog’s saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria. It’s commonly known as the “flesh eating disease”. We’ll need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue. We may need to remove the leg.

CUDDY: The MRI revealed a problem.
LATE 30s MAN: No kidding.
CUDDY: I’m sorry none of your doctors found it earlier; I’m personally going to oversee your treatment from now on.
LATE 30s MAN: You’re gonna cut me open, aren’t ya?
CUDDY: We may need to remove the leg.

HOUSE: His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn’t caused by the self-injection, wasn’t caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.
FOREMAN:  God, you were right. It’s House.

CUDDY: We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there’s too much –
HOUSE: I don’t care what you find.
CUDDY: It may become necessary in order to save your life.
HOUSE: I like my leg. I’ve had it for as long as I can remember.
STACY: Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.
HOUSE: They’re not cutting it off.

HOUSE: Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it’s okay to cut a leg off and he’s going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
REBELLIOUS: Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.
HOUSE: Well, of course they care about their patients. They just care about themselves more. Which is not an unreasonable position. Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong. Which means you’ve gotta be extra careful. Which is such a pain in the ass.

CUDDY: Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.
HOUSE: Yeah, they’re just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation.
CUDDY: Amputation is safer.
HOUSE: For you, or me?
CUDDY: The blockage of blood flow –
HOUSE: Four-day blockage.
CUDDY: Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --
HOUSE: If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.
CUDDY: The post-operative pain alone –
HOUSE: I’ll get through it. I understand the risks, you’re in the clear. Go schedule an OR. 
STACY: God, you’re an idiot.
HOUSe: I think I’m more of a jerk.
STACY: I’m not being glib. And I’m not being cute, I don’t want you to kill yourself.
HOUSE: I’m not gonna die.
STACY: Oh, I feel completely reassured.






HOUSE: I think they gotta up that morphine.
STACY: The doctors say they can’t.
HOUSE: The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
STACY: They screwed up, it doesn’t mean they’re wrong this time.
HOUSE: Sure doesn’t mean they’re right.
STACY: Morphine will kill you.
HOUSE: I can handle it.
STACY: You’re in pain, you’re not thinking right.
HOUSE: That’s why I need the damn morphine!
STACY: Okay, I’ll talk to them. 

STACY: Oh my God, how much longer is the pain going to last?
CUDDY: It depends on how much muscle cell death there was. He could be right, he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.
STACY: Or?
CUDDY: He could be in pain for the rest of his life. There’s a third option, surgically. A middle ground between what we did and amputation.
STACY: He’s not big on middle ground.
CUDDY: Yeah.

HOUSE: Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
NURSE: You just had 5 mLs.
HOUSE: The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
NURSE: I’ll talk to your doctor.
HOUSE: Well, you better make it fast, ‘cause I’m about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.
NURSE: I could get in trouble –
HOUSE: Listen, it’s not a narcotic! I’m not looking for a buzz. You’ve got about twenty seconds.  I was wrong. 
SOMEONE: What have you got?
NURSE: Wide complex tachycardia.
CUDDY: Who diagnosed –
NURSE: He did.
CUDDY: Paddles! Charge.
NURSE: Clear! 

HOUSE: The patient was technically dead for over a minute.



CUDDY: He’s back.

WILSON:  Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?
HOUSE: Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant… Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see visions, this patient saw. They’re all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.
FOREMAN: You choose to believe that?
HOUSE: There’s no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.
CAMERON: You find it more comforting to believe that this is it?
HOUSE: I find it more comforting to believe that this isn’t simply a test.

STACY: How bad is the pain right now?
HOUSE: It’s bad.
STACY: It’s not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You’d be getting better.
HOUSE: It’s just taking longer.
STACY: No, it’s not. We’ve got to let him cut the leg off.
HOUSE: It’s my leg. It’s my life.
STACY: Would you give up your leg to save my life?
HOUSE: Of course I would.
STACY: Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?
HOUSE: I would say it’s their choice.
STACY: Wha – not a chance! You’d browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You’d shove it in their face that it’s just a damn leg! You don’t think you deserve to live? You don’t think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? 
HOUSE: I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.
STACY: The pain alone is going to kill you.
HOUSE: I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.

CUDDY: He change his mind?
STACY: No. He’s asked to be put in a chemically induced coma so he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.
CUDDY: We can do that.
STACY: What happens after he’s in the coma?
CUDDY: We’ll obviously monitor his condition closely, and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident –
STACY: I meant, I’m his health-care proxy, I get to make medical decisions for him if he’s not able to.
CUDDY: You should talk to him about what he wants to do.
STACY: I know what he wants, but if he’s out it’s my call, right? 

CUDDY: You’ll be out in less than a minute.
HOUSE: Thank you.  Hey.
STACY: Hey.
HOUSe: I’ll see you when I wake up. We’ll go golfing. I love you.
STACY: I love you, too. I’m sorry.
HOUSE:  You’ve got nothing to be sorry about. 
STACY: The middle ground you were talking about?
CUDDY: We go in, take out the dead muscle. There’s still some risk of reperfusion injury, but –
STACY: Give me the forms you need signed.
CUDDY: You’re saving his life.
STACY: He won’t see it that way.

HOUSE: Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.
CARING: She had no right to do that.
REBELLIOUS: She had the proxy.
CARING: She knew he didn’t want the surgery.
REBELLIOUS: She saved his life!
KEEN: Well, we don’t know that. Maybe he would have been fine –
CARING: It doesn’t matter. It’s the patient’s call.
REBELLIOUS: The patient’s an idiot.
HOUSE:  They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?
CUDDY:  Twenty minutes ago.
HOUSE: I’m not doing this again.  And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad. Not even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That’s why he’s always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. 

HOUSE: Stacy, it’s Gregg. I’ve got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn’t late. 


SCOTT
Yes. It is
Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS
STEPHEN STILLS
So when do we get to meet her?
KIM PINE
Oh please. Let it be soon
DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly
SCOTT
That's for me
5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5
An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack
SCOTT
You promise to be good?
KNIVES CHAU
Of course I'll be good!
SCOTT
No, really. Please be good
KNIVES CHAU
Am I normally not?
Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through
SCOTT
Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
Stills. He's the talent
STEPHEN STILLS
Hey
STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives
STEPHEN STILLS
Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT
She'll just sit in the corner, man
STEPHEN STILLS
I mean, I want her to geek out on us
B>SCOTT
She'll geek. She geeks. She has the
Capacity to geek
Stephen Stills quickly opens the door and waves Knives in
(CONTINUED)
STEPHEN STILLS
You're good
6 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 6
Knives enters, looking around the rehearsal pad with awe:
Bare bulb, ratty rug, drums, guitar, bass, LAME BRAND amps
KNIVES CHAU
Wow
SCOTT
Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat
Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves
KNIVES CHAU
Hi, sorry, what was your name?
KIM PINE
Kim
KNIVES CHAU
You play the drums?
REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands
KIM PINE
...yes
KNIVES CHAU
That is so awesome
SCOTT
Knives, that's Young Neil
KNIVES CHAU
Hi. What do you play?
YOUNG NEIL
Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's
Kind of a big question
Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it
YOUNG NEIL
Oh. I'm not in the band. I just
Live here
Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life
SCOTT
Let's start with Launchpad McQuack
STEPHEN STILLS
That's not the actual title of the-
KIM PINE
WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! 1-2-3-4!
Kim BASHES the kit and Sex Bob-Omb EXPLODE INTO ROCK! GUITAR
AND BASS LEADS LEAP INTO THE AIR, SPELLING OUT OUR TITLE...
SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD
TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space
Seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks
Unintelligable lyrics
Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering
KNIVES CHAU
You guys...are so...amazing
7 EXT. BUS STOP - EVENING 7
Scott bids adieu to a stunned Knives as she gets on a bus
KNIVES CHAU
I can't even...Sex Bob-Omb
Amazing
8 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' ROOM - EVENING 8
The band and Young Neil lounge around Stephen Stills' room
STEPHEN STILLS
She seems nice
SCOTT
Yeaaah
YOUNG NEIL
She seems awesome
SCOTT
Yeaaah
KIM PINE
Scott, if your life had a face I
Would punch it
SCOTT
Yeaaah...wait, what?
KIM PINE
I mean, are you really happy or are
You really evil?
SCOTT
Like, do I have ulterior motives or
Something? I'm offended, Kim
STEPHEN STILLS
Wounded even?
SCOTT
Hurt, Kim
KIM PINE
You? Hurt?
Scott takes a breath, turns to Young Neil
SCOTT
Neil, you were saying she seems awesome
YOUNG NEIL
Yeah, she seems awesome
SCOTT
Yeaaaah...
9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9
Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He
Turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal
"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"
SCOTT
Before you hear some dirty lies
From someone else, yes, I'm dating
A 17 year old
Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading
WALLACE
Is he cute?
SCOTT
Ha, ha, ha, ha
WALLACE
Does this mean we have to stop
Sleeping together?
SCOTT
Do you see another bed in here?
TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the
One room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included
WALLACE
Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever
SCOTT
So. The whole seventeen year old
Thing. Don't tell too many people
WALLACE
Hey, you know me

SCOTT
I mean. Don't tell my sister
WALLACE
You know me
Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting
SCOTT
Who are you texting?
RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up
STACEY (O.S.)
Seventeen years old? Scandal!
Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on
Her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'œIf
You are using your cellphone, you will not be served'
"STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."
SCOTT
That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY
Wallace. Duh
SCOTT
That gossipy bitch
WALLACE (O.S.)
You know me
Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless
SCOTT
Wallace!
Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair
STACEY
Who is this mysterious child you date?
SCOTT
Her name is Knives. Knives Chau
STACEY
A seventeen year old Chinese
Schoolgirl? You're ridiculous
SCOTT
It's a Catholic school too
STACEY
With the uniform and everything?

SCOTT
Yeah, the whole deal
STACEY
Oh my God, you haven't-
SCOTT
No no no. We haven't even held
Hands. I think she hugged me once
STACEY
Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?
SCOTT
I don't know...it's just nice, you
Know? It's just...simple
STACEY
It's been over a year since you got
Dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named
Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine
Looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad
STACEY (CONT'D)
So, are you legitimately moving on
Or is this just you being insane?
Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next
To a hot redhead in happier times
SCOTT
Can I get back to you on that?
A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...
10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10
Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL
Uniformed boys and girls pour out
WALLACE
I do not want to be here. At all
SCOTT
This school has boys too
WALLACE
I hate you. Even I would think twice
About dating a seventeen year old
SCOTT
Well, she's only allowed out when
The sun is up, so I wouldn't call
It dating, more like...

WALLACE
Playtime?
SCOTT
That doesn't sound so good either

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Scott! Heyyyy!
Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind
SCOTT
Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
Roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
My class is gay?
WALLACE
Yes. Does he wear glasses?
SCOTT
Wallace, you go now! Begone!
Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers
WALLACE
You're too good for him. Run
11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11
Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
Arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION)
They punch and kick in unison, side by side
SCOTT
Did you know the original name of Pac-
Man was Puck-man? You would think it's
Because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
Hockey puck, but actually it comes
From the Japanese phrase paku-paku
Which means to flap ones mouth open
And closed. They changed it over here
Because Puck-Man is too easy to
Vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
And turn it into an F or whatever?
Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move
KNIVES CHAU
Ohmigod, like...wow
SCOTT
Yeah. Wow
The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8...
Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, I got it!
Scott and Knives leave a pizza joint, slices in hand
KNIVES CHAU
Tamara is into this Korean guy
Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby
Has a crush on Mina
SCOTT
I thought Derek and Tamara had a
Mutual like-each-other thing going
What happened?
A13 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY A13
Scott and Knives shop for T-shirts. Hangers click in time
KNIVES CHAU
I don't listen to much music. I
Know a lot of kids who play piano
Or whatever, but you guys ROCK
SCOTT
I knew I personally rocked, but I
Never suspected that we rocked as a
Unit. Thank you, Knives
13 INT. SONIC BOOM (RECORD STORE) - DAY 13
Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync
KNIVES CHAU
I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE
SCOTT
Well, we're already pretty big. But
It might be cool if cool people
Wore our T-shirt
Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:
"JULIE, 22, STILLS' GIRLFRIEND, RATING: WHAT IS HER PROBLEM?"
KNIVES CHAU
Excuse me, do you have anything by
'The Clash At Demonhead'?
JULIE
Have you tried the section marked
'The Clash At Demonhead'?
SCOTT
Thank you, Julie
JULIE
Are you coming to my party Friday
Or will you be busy babysitting?
SCOTT
Thank you, Julie
(TO KNIVES)
You don't want to listen to her

SCOTT (CONT'D)
And you definitely don't want to
Listen to them
Scott puts The Clash at Demonhead CD back in the rack
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, I heart them so much
SCOTT
I hearted them too until they signed
To a major label and the singer turned
Into a total bitch and ruined my life
But that's just me
KNIVES CHAU
(OBLIVIOUS)
Envy Adams is sooo cool. Do you
Read her blog?
SCOTT
Sorry, you were saying about me?
14 EXT. SNOWY TORONTO STREET - DAY 14
Scott and Knives amble down a snow covered sidewalk
KNIVES CHAU
I mean, I've...I've never gone out
With someone so talented
SCOTT
You go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES CHAU
...no
SCOTT
Yeah, so whatever, man!
KNIVES CHAU
I've never even kissed a guy
Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her
SCOTT
Me neither
15 EXT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY 15
Scott and Knives walk up to the front of Wallace's apartment
KNIVES CHAU
So this is your secret lair? Can I
Come in?
SCOTT
My secret lair is one of those 'no
Girls allowed' deals
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, okay
SCOTT
But do you want to see the house
Where I grew up?
KNIVES CHAU
Sure
They literally walk across the street to a small house
SCOTT
Here you go
KNIVES CHAU
Wow
SCOTT
Yeah. Wow
Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...
16 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY 16
...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his
Knees next to a lonely cactus
SCOTT
Oh God...so...so alone
A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She
Wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink
Hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun
< b>MYSTERIOUS GIRL 
You're not alone. You're just
Having some idiotic dream
SCOTT
Does that mean we can make out?
But she's gone...
17 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - ? 17
...SCOTT WAKES UP, sitting up in the FUTON
SCOTT
Oh God...
Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes
WALLACE
What is it, Scott?
SCOTT
I had this totally weird dream
OTHER VOICE
Oh God
WALLACE
What is it, Scott?
A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:
"OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS"
OTHER SCOTT
Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me
Not interested
SCOTT
But there was this girl...
WALLACE
Girl?
OTHER SCOTT
Was this an Envy related dream?
WALLACE
We don't use the E-word in this house
SCOTT
No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...
OTHER SCOTT
Yay for that
Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes
WALLACE
Speaking of new, weren't you
Supposed to take your fake high
School girlfriend to the library a
Half-hour ago?
SCOTT
What? It's like, six in the morning
Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Arrrrgh!

KNIVES CHAU
What's wrong?
Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library
He carries a stack of books for Knives
SCOTT
Libraries remind me of grade school
KNIVES CHAU
That must seem like a reeeeally
Long time ago
SCOTT
Uh. Let's talk about something else
The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He
Freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM
Skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION
KNIVES CHAU
Do you know that girl?
The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to
The librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades
Out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts
KNIVES CHAU
Scott?
Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl
STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)
SCOTT!
19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 19
Scott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds
STEPHEN STILLS
You only played one note for that
Entire song
SCOTT
It was...uh...my hand slipped
KIM PINE
Is your girlfriend distracting you?
SCOTT
My girlfriend?
A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch
KNIVES CHAU
I'll... I'll be quieter
STEPHEN STILLS
Let's do that one again

SCOTT
Sorry, what are we doing?
20 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 20

STEPHEN STILLS
I told you like fifty times!
Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an
Icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds
KIM PINE
We're going to this party, retard
SCOTT
Party?
YOUNG NEIL
At Julie's
SCOTT
Ugh. I thought you guys split
STEPHEN STILLS
We did. But, you know, there may be
Some label guys there, so...
SCOTT
Aw, man. This is going to suck
KIM PINE
At least it will give us something
To complain about
SCOTT
Awww maaan...
21 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21
A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded
House party. Both have red plastic cups in hand
SCOTT
...this sucks
YOUNG NEIL
Sucks
SCOTT
I'm going to go pee due to boredom
Scott exits frame
YOUNG NEIL
I have to pee
Neil sips his drink
Scott passes by COMEAU, a bespectacled hipster geek:
'˜COMEAU, 25, FUN FACT: KNOWS EVERYONE (INCLUDING YOU)'
SCOTT
Hey Comeau
COMEAU
Hey Scott. Some party huh? You
Gettin' your drink on?

INTEGRATED FINAL 16
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21
SCOTT
This is Coke Zero. I don't drink
COMEAU
You don't drink? I remember you
Getting ridiculously drunk off two
G&T's one time and-
SCOTT
(QUICKLY)
Comeau, you know everyone, right?
COMEAU
Pretty much
SCOTT
Do you know this one girl with hair
Like this?
Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona
COMEAU
Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone
Said she was coming tonight actually
SCOTT
WHAT?
COMEAU
You got the hots for her? I hear
She's hardcore...
Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud...
22 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 22
Scott scans the party. His eyes go WIDE. He CRUSHES his
Plastic cup. There she is...playing the wall...RAMONA! Aloof
Enigmatic. Hot. Scott sidles up and stands next to her
SCOTT
Hey, what's up?
RAMONA
Nothing
SCOTT
Hey, you know Pacman?
RAMONA
I know of him
Scott begins to babble
(CONTINUED)
SCOTT
Well you know Pac-Man was
Originally Puckman but not because
Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck
And paku-paku-paku means flapping
Your mouth and they changed it
Because if you scratch out the "P"
And turn it into an "F'? You know?
Like...
RAMONA
Yeah that's amazing
SCOTT
Um...am I dreaming?
Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away
SCOTT (CONT'D)
I'll leave you alone forever now
"THEN HE STALKED HER FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY..."
Series of quick shots as Scott follows Ramona. He ducks
Around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude. Ramona Leaves the party
Scott grabs a startled Young Neil
SCOTT
DUDE!
YOUNG NEIL
WHA?
SCOTT
SHE'S TOTALLY REAL!
YOUNG NEIL
WHO!?
STEPHEN STILLS
RAMONA FLOWERS!
YOUNG NEIL
WHUH?
JUMP CUT. Scott RUNS towards Comeau
SCOTT
DUDE. What do you know about Ramona
Flowers?!
COMEAU
All I know is she's American
SCOTT
(EXOTICALLY)
American...
COMEAU
But you should talk to Sandra and
MONIQUE-
"SANDRA AND MONIQUE, 24, TWO GIRLS COMEAU KNOWS"
SCOTT
LADYDUDES! What do you know about
Ramona Flowers?

MONIQUE
I think she has a boyfriend
SANDRA
Some guy back in New York
MONIQUE
Doesn't she have the most
Ridiculous name?
SANDRA
I know. It's so 'œRamona Quimby
Aged 8' and yet...Flowers
The girls laugh. Scott does not
SCOTT
Yeah. What else?
JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone
ABOUT RAMONA:
PARTYGOER #1
I heard she kicks all kind of ass
PARTYGOER #2
She's on another level
PARTYGOER #3
She's got men dying at her feet
PARTYGOER #4
She's got some battle scars
PARTYGOER #5
Not to be entered into lightly
We end on the surly JULIE (the rude clerk) who steps in front
Of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her
JULIE
What about Ramona Flowers?
SCOTT
You know her? Tell me. Now
JULIE
She just moved here. Got a job with
Amazon. Comes into my work
SCOTT
Does she really?
STEPHEN STILLS
Didn't you say she just broke up
With someone, Jools?

SCOTT
Did she really?
STEPHEN STILLS
That they had a huge fight or whatever?
SCOTT
Did they reeeally?
JULIE
...yes. But I didn't want Scott to
Know that, Stephen

SCOTT
Yeah, I don't know what it is about
That girl, she just-
JULIE
Scott, I forbid you from hitting on
Ramona. Even if you haven't had a
Real girlfriend in over a year-
STEPHEN STILLS
Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning
Period is officially over. He's
Totally dating a high schooler
JULIE
Dating a high schooler is the
Mourning period
STEPHEN STILLS
She's got a point
SCOTT
I thought you guys broke up
JULIE
I don't want you scaring off the
Coolest girl at my party Scott. We
All know you're a total lady killer
Wannabe jerky jerkSCOTT
That's garbage! Completely untrue
JULIE
That time with Lisa-
SCOTT
Misunderstanding
JULIE
That time with Hollie-
SCOTT
Not what it looked like!
JULIE
That time you dumped Kim for-
SCOTT
Hey, me and Kim are all good now
SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds
JULIE
Whatever, Ramona is out of your
League, let's leave it at that
JULIE (CONT'D)
And anyway, I'm not even sure she
Really did have a big breakup. She
Keeps mentioning some guy named
Gideon
SCOTT
(NOT LISTENING)
Yeah, I don't know what it is about
That girl, she just-
JULIE
Forget it Scott!!!
23 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 23
Scott lies on the futon, WIDE awake. Wallace storms in
WALLACE
Guess who's druuunk?
SCOTT
I guess Wallace
WALLACE
You guess right
Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott
SCOTT
So, that girl. From my dream
WALLACE
Girl. Okay...
SCOTT
I saw her at the library...
WALLACE
Library...can I pretend we're
Talking about a guy?
SCOTT
So then I'm at this party, and hey!
There she is
WALLACE
There he is
SCOTT
I think she's...
WALLACE
You think he's...
SCOTT
I think she's the girl of my dreams
WALLACE
Mmm. Then you should break up with
Your fake high school girlfriend
SCOTT
I've never been so sure about
Something
WALLACE
Then you should break up with your
Fake high school girlfriend
SCOTT
What's that?
WALLACE
Break...up...fake...high
School...girlfriend...
SCOTT
I'm not getting it, friend
Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with
STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone
STACEY
You're thinking of juggling two chicks!?
SCOTT
Not even!
STACEY
Well, you should break up with your
Fake high school girlfriend
SCOTT
Wait. Who told you?
STACEY
Duh. Wallace
SCOTT
He's not even conscious!
STACEY
Whatever. You of all people should know
How sucky it is to get cheated on
SCOTT
Don't you have a job to do?
STACEY
You're right. I should send out a
Mass text about this. Bye
Scott looks to Wallace, who is out cold, cellphone in hand
(CONTINUED)

SCOTT
Wallace, how do you do that?
HARD CUT to MORNING LIGHT filling the room!
SCOTT (O.S.)
WALLACE!
Wallace sits bolt upright. Scott sits at Wallace's computer
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Amazon.ca. What's the website for that?
WALLACE
...Amazon.ca
SCOTT
Awesome! I have to order something
Reeeally cool
COMPUTER
"You've got mail!"
SCOTT
Dude! This thing claims I have mail!
WALLACE
It's amazing what they can do with
Computers these days
SCOTT
Dude! Now I'm reading it!
WALLACE
I'm so happy for you
SCOTT
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to
My attention that we will be
Fighting soon. My name is Matthew
Patel, and I'm" blah blah 'œfair
Warning' blah blah...hmm. This
Is...this is...THIS IS...!!!
WALLACE
WHAT?!
SCOTT
This is boring. Delete!
CLICK.' Scott walks to the front door. Moments pass
WALLACE
Scott. Are you waiting for the
Package you just ordered?
SCOTT
Maybe
WALLACE
It's the weekend. It won't ship
Until Monday at the earliest

DINGY DONG
Scott JUMPS to his feet
SCOTT
You were saying?
Scott opens the door. It's KNIVES CHAU!
SCOTT
Heyyy...
KNIVES CHAU
Attack hug!
Knives smothers Scott
SCOTT
Attack hug. That's cute
He plasters on his best fake smile
KNIVES CHAU
Remember you were supposed to meet
Me at the bus stop a half-hour ago?
SCOTT
How could I possibly forget?
24 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 24
Scott and Knives flip through the record bins, out of sync
KNIVES CHAU
Yearbook club is getting SO boring
I cannot believe the music they put
On while we work
SCOTT
That's sucky
25 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY 25
Knives buys a hip and trendy jacket. Scott sits on a couch
Next to the DO NOT SIT sign, still distracted
KNIVES CHAU
Hannah broke up with Alan and now
She's all into Derek...
SCOTT
Uh huh
26 EXT. PIZZA PIZZA - DAY 26
Scott and Knives walk out of a pizza joint. Knives chows down
On a slice. Scott doesn't eat, his thoughts elsewhere

KNIVES CHAU
...but Tamara claims she has dibs
On Derek
SCOTT
I tell ya'
Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION, side by side
Scott plays halfheartedly, his timing off
KNIVES CHAU
Combo!
Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR
IMAGE of Scott's videogame avatar appears on screen
KNIVES CHAU
Uh oh, NegaNinja
NEGANINJA - squares up against Scott's avatar
SCOTT
I can never get past that guy
Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The 'œCONTINUE?'
Countdown comes up...10...9...8...
KNIVES CHAU
Do you want to keep going?
Scott takes a long look at Knives
SCOTT
Um, I think...I think...
Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3...2...1...
28 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 28

STEPHEN STILLS
Game on, everybody. Game. On
An excited Stills addresses Sex Bob-Omb. Scott tunes his
Bass, alone by the window, staring out
STEPHEN STILLS
I got us a show
KNIVES CHAi
OH MY GOSH WHEN?!
Knives BURSTS into frame. Scott winces
STEPHEN STILLS
Wednesday, The Rockit. And even
Better? It's the T.I.B.B
KNIVES CHAU
The Toronto International Battle of
The Bands?!

STEPHEN STILLS
S'right. This guy at work was like
"Steve, do you know anyone in a
Band?" and I was like 'œI'm in a
Band' and he was like 'œYou're in a
Band?' and I was like 'œYeah I'm
Totally in a band'-
KIM PINE
Great story, man
KNIVES CHAU
Is there a prize or something?!
STEPHEN STILLS
Only a record deal with G-man Graves!
SCOTT
What? Who?
KNIVES CHAU
You don't know?
STEPHEN STILLS
Indie Producer of the millennium?!
SCOTT
Oh
YOUNG NEIL
Whoa
Stills gestures to Knives' home-made Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt
STEPHEN STILLS
If we win...it won't just be Knives
Wearing a Sex Bob-Omb shirt. It'll
Be the cool kids too
Knives can barely contain herself. She grabs Scott
KNIVES CHAU
I will do everything I can to get
Out of study group and come
SCOTT
Sure. Great
We follow Scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Oh my gosh, who are you battling?
STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)
Crash and the Boys

YOUNG NEIL (O.S.)
That one band with Crash? And
Those Boys?
KIM PINE
Yeah that's the one
YOUNG NEIL
I hate them!
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Oh my gosh, I hate them too!
STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)
Yeah, they suc
29 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING 29
Scott pees in a state of dreamy reverie. The PEE BAR above
His head slowly reduces. He stares at himself in the mirror
Scott exits the bathroom, entering...
30 INT. DREAM HIGH SCHOOL - ? 30
...a long, empty HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. Scott's footsteps echo
As he moves towards a classroom door with a STAR on it...
RAMONA FLOWERS bursts through the door, skating past Scott
And down the hall, PACKAGE from AMAZON clutched in her hand
Scott runs after her, around a corner, down a row of LOCKERS
Leading to...the outside of WALLACE'S APARTMENT???
31 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 31
Scott LEAPS out of the futon and RUNS towards the front door
THROWING IT OPEN and startling Ramona Flowers just as she
Presses the doorbell. DINGY DONG...
SCOTT
Hi, um, I was thinking about asking
You out, but then I realized how
Stupid that would be
(BEAT)
Do you want to go out sometime?
RAMONA
Um, no, that's okay. You just have
To sign for this alright?
SCOTT
I just woke up, and you were in my
Dream. I dreamt you were delivering
Me this package. Is that weird?
RAMONA
It's not weird at allSCOTT
It's not?
RAMONA
No, it's just like, you've got this
Really convenient subspace highway
Running through your head that I
Like to use. It's like three miles
In fifteen seconds
SCOTT
Right...
(CONTINUED)
RAMONA
Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't
Have that in Canada
SCOTT
You don't remember me do you? I met
You at the party the other day
RAMONA
Were you the Pac-Man guy?
SCOTT
No. Not even. That was some total
Ass. I was the other guy. You're
Ramona Flowers right?
RAMONA
That's meSCOTT
So, you're like American?
RAMONA
Why, am I coming off as rude?
SCOTT
Not at all. Noooooo...
Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen
RAMONA
You know...you need to sign for
This. Whatever this is?SCOTT
It's something really cool. You'd
Be impressed
RAMONA
You still have to sign
SCOTT
But if I sign for it, you'll leave
RAMONA
Yeah. That's how it works
SCOTT
Okay well, can we just maybe just
Hang out sometime? Get to know each
Other? You're the new kid on the
Block, right? I've lived here
Forever. I mean...there are reasons
For you to hang out with me?
RAMONA
You're all over the place
SCOTT
You are like...my dream girl
RAMONA
I need to find a new route
SCOTT
Either that or you need to start
Hanging out with me
RAMONA
You want me to hang out with you?
SCOTT
Um...you know...if that's cool
RAMONA
If I say yes, will you sign for
Your damn package?
Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the
Package straight in the trash
SCOTT
Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?

Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the
Park. The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them
SCOTT
Why are you just standing there?
RAMONA
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you
SCOTT
Sorry, I just assumed you were too
Cool to be on time
RAMONA
Well. You assumed wrong
SCOTT
So what do you want to do? We could
Get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip
Through some records at Sonic Boom
Oh, or there's this awesome game
Called Ninja Ninja Revolution at-

RAMONA
I'm not into simulated violence
SCOTT
I'm cool with whatever you want to do
RAMONA
This is good
Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park
SCOTT
This is good. So how'd you end up in
Toronto?
RAMONA
Just needed to escape I guess
SCOTT
Oh yeah?
RAMONA
I got this job here. And Gideon had
Always said Toronto was one of the
Great cities so...
SCOTT
Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?
RAMONA
He's...a friend
SCOTT
Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA
Do you mind if we don't get into
That right now?
SCOTT
It's so not interesting to me
They sit on some swings in the park
RAMONA
So what about you? What do you do?
SCOTT
I'm between jobs
RAMONA
Between what and what?
SCOTT
My last job is a long story filled
With sighs
RAMONA
I know plenty of those
SCOTT
Is that why you left New York?
RAMONA
Pretty much. It was time to head
Somewhere a little more chilled
SCOTT
Well, it's certainly chilled here
RAMONA
Yeah
Uh. Chilled as in cold
RAMONA
Yeah
SCOTT
I'm totally obsessed with you
RAMONA
I didn't mean to get you obsessed
SCOTT
I just haven't been obsessed with a
Girl for a long time. It's weird
RAMONA
That's probably because you sleep
With a guy
SCOTT
Um...
RAMONA
I was guessing from your apartment
But you totally do!

SCOTT
It's... we're just poor! We can't
Afford two beds! We're not gay!
Actually... no... Wallace is pretty
Gay
RAMONA
Dude, relax. I believe you. You're
Too desperate to be gay
SCOTT
I feel so stupid
RAMONA
Aw... you're probably not that
Stupid
Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing
SCOTT (CONT'D)
I'm... mostly stupid
RAMONA
Well, you're definitely stupid if
You want to go out with me
SCOTT
Exactly, yeah
The snowfall gets heavier
RAMONA
This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?
SCOTT
Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole
Thing is an unmitigated disaster
RAMONA
I think 'act of God' is a pretty
Decent excuse for a lousy date
SCOTT
So this is a 'date', eh?
RAMONA
Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue
SCOTT
Tongue...
The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away
RAMONA
Anyway, night's not over yet. I think
There's a thingy up here somewhere

SCOTT
A thingy?
RAMONA
A door
SCOTT
A door? I... I... I can't see you
I'm blind. Help me
A door with a STAR on it appears out of the whiteness. Ramona Opens the door
Scott and Ramona fall into blackness...
35 INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 35
Scott shivers at the kitchen table of Ramona's cozy, girl
Friendly apartment. He watches as she slips out of her coat
RAMONA
What kind of tea do you want?
SCOTT
There's more than one kind?
RAMONA
We have blueberry, raspberry
Ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green
Tea with lemon, green tea with lemon
And honey, liver disaster, ginger
With honey, ginger without honey
Vanilla almond, white truffle
Blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut
Constant comment and earl grey
SCOTT
Did you make some of those up?
RAMONA
I think I'll have sleepytime
SCOTT
That sounds good to me
RAMONA
Let me get you a blanket
SCOTT
That would actually be awesome
Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs
He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he
Finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt
RAMONA
Dude! I'm changing
Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK
SCOTT (O.S.)
AAAH! Sorry, I'm just...cold!RAMONA (O.S.)
Here, does this help?SCOTT (O.S.)
That's...very warm. What is that?
35 CONTINUED: 35
Scott opens his eyes to see Ramona hugging him
SCOTT
Ohh...kay
They look into each others eyes...camera circles Scott and
Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session. Scott
Imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline
Ramona breaks off, smiling. Scott is in heaven
SCOTT
Were you..were you just going to
Bring the blanket from your bed?
RAMONA
I guess...
SCOTT
Maybe...maybe we should both get
Under it...since we're so cold
RAMONA
Well...what about our tea?
SCOTT
I can...not have tea
The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off
Revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes
His shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-
RAMONA
I changed my mind
SCOTT
Changed it to what? From what?
RAMONA
I don't want to have sex with you
Pilgrim. Not right now
SCOTT
Ohh...kay
RAMONA
It's not like I'm gonna send you
Home in a snowstorm or anything
You can sleep in my bed. And I
Reserve the right to change my mind
About the sex later
Ramona curls up next to Scott

SCOTT
This is cool, just this. It's been
Like a really long time, and this
Is...I think I needed this
Whatever this is. So, thanks
RAMONA
You're welcome
They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -
36 INT. RAMONA'S ROOM - MORNING 36
DAYLIGHT! Scott awakens. Ramona is gone. An arrow points to
The empty spot in the bed next to him
'NO RAMONA'
Another arrow point out that-
'œSHE'S IN THE SHOWER'
Ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel. Scott relaxes
RAMONA
I have to work
SCOTT
Work?
RAMONA
You have to leave
37 EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 37
Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to
Her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks
SCOTT
Hey, can this not be a one night
Stand? For one thing, I didn't even
Get any...that was a joke
RAMONA
What did you have in mind?
SCOTT
Umm...oh, come to the first round
Of this battle of the bands thing
RAMONA
(TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED)
You have a band?
SCOTT
Yeah, we're terrible. Please come
RAMONA
Sure
37 CONTINUED: (2) 37
Ramona shrugs and ROLLERBLADES through the snow...(somehow)
SCOTT
Wait! Can I get your number?
SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott
She hands him a note. '˜RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'˜
SCOTT
Wow, girl number
Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away
RAMONA
See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim
SCOTT
Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The-
38 INT. THE ROCKIT - NIGHT 38

'œTHE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'
Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young
Hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace
And Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses
SCOTT
You totally came!
RAMONA
Yes. I did totally come
Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish
STACEY
Excuse my brother. He's chronically
Enfeebled. I'm Stacey
RAMONA
Hey
STACEY
And this is Wallace, his room-mate
WALLACE
Hey
STACEY
And this is my boyfriend Jimmy
WALLACE
(staring at Jimmy)
Heyyy

STACEY
And this is Knives, Scott's-
Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in
SCOTT
HEYYYYYYYY!
KNIVES CHAU
Hey
Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives
Looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes
KNIVES CHAU
Do you like?
SCOTT
I...uh...
LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives
And Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Have. To. Go
Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage
PROMOTER
This next band are from Brampton
And they are Crash And The Boys
39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39
Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping
Through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band
STEPHEN STILLS
This is a nightmare. Is this a
Nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up
KIM
Once we're on stage you'll be fine
STILLS
We were just on stage. For sound
Check. The sound guy hated us
SCOTT
It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters
People love us. Right?
Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and
Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY

Crash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy
WALLACE
Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?
JIMMY
They...haven't started playing yet
WALLACE
That was a test, Jimmy. You passedCRASH
Good evening. I am Crash, and these
Are the Boys
WALLACE
IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO?
CRASH
Yes
TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger
A41 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS A41
Sex Bob-omb peer at the band from offstage. Kim glowers
KIM PINE
They have a girl drummer?
B41 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS B41

CRASH
This is called "I am so sad. I am
So very very sad." And it goes a
Little something like this
Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds
CRASH
Thank you
Wallace yells from the balcony
WALLACE
IT'S NOT A RACE, GUYS!
CRASH
This song is for the guy who keeps
Yelling from the balcony, and it's
Called "We Hate You, Please Die."
WALLACE
Sweet! I love this one!

STEPHEN STILLS
These guys are good. Are these guys
Good?
Kim Pine scowls harder than ever
STEPHEN STILLS
These guys are good

CRASH
This is called "Last Song Kills
Audience". It'll be our last song
Tonight and your last song EVER...
Sound explodes from the stage. The audience are stunned
Stills paces backstage as the others watch the band
STEPHEN STILLS
How are we supposed to follow this?
We're not going to win, we're not
Gonna sign with G-Man and we'll
Never play opening night at the
Chaos Theatre
(FREAKING OUT)
GODDAMN IT SCOTT, WILL YOU STOP
JUST STANDING THERE, YOU'RE
FREAKING ME OUT!
44 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 44
As Crash And The Boys climax, Stacey turns to Ramona
STACEY
So, how do you know Scott?
RAMONA
He's...um. He's a friend
STACEY
Hard for me to keep track
Sometimes. He has so many friends
Ramona arches an eyebrow. Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara
STACEY
So Knives, how did you meet Scott?

Scott looks up into the balcony, sees Stacey talking to
Knives. He turns around and slaps Stephen Stills in the face
SCOTT
We gotta play now and loud!
46 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 46
Stacey and Ramona listen intently to Knives' story
KNIVES CHAU
Well, I was on the bus with my Mom-
Knives freezes, staring at the stage
RAMONA
Is that seriously the end of the story?
KNIVES CHAU
OH MY GOSH, they're on!
47 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 47
ONSTAGE: A DISHEVELED PROMOTER walks to the mic
PROMOTER
This next band is from Toronto
And...yeah. So give it up for
Sex...Bob-Omb?
SEX BOB-OMB walk on. Wallace and Knives give the only cheers
STEPHEN STILLS
Scott...you ready?
Scott nods vigorously
STEPHEN STILLS
Kim...you rea-
KIM PINE
WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB. ONE, TWO...
ANGLE on Knives. She faints in the excitement
KIM PINE (CONT'D)
THREE, FOUR!
Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a
Chunk of ceiling CRASHES down and a SPINDLY INDIAN HIPSTER
KID DIVES HEAD FIRST through the hole, finger pointed at
Scott as he sails towards the stage!

MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a
Lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that
Borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out)
MATTHEW PATEL
Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew
Patel. Consider our fight...begun!
SCOTT
What did I do?
Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott
SCOTT
What do I do?!
WALLACE
FIGHT!
Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his
Left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right
Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott
MATTHEW PATEL
Alright. Alright
WALLACE
Watch out! It's that one guy!
SCOTT
Thank you, Wallace!
Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
Sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
Hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle
MATTHEW PATEL
You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim
SCOTT
Who the hell are you anyway?
The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters
MATTHEW PATEL
My name is Matthew Patel and I'm
Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!
SCOTT
You're what?
MATTHEW PATEL
Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!
All eyes WHIP up to Ramona...

RAMONA
Anyone need another drink?
Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel
Punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out
(CONTINUED)
SCOTT
We're fighting because of Ramona?
MATTHEW PATEL
Didn't you get my e-mail explaining
The situation?
SCOTT
I skimmed it
MATTHEW PATEL
You will pay for your insolence!
Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and
Counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott
Jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy
WALLACE
What's up with his outfit?
OTHER HECKLER
Yeah! Is he a pirate?
Scott looks at Patel's outfit
SCOTT
Are you a pirate?
MATTHEW PATEL
Pirates are in this year!
Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
Puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona
SCOTT
You really went out with this guy?
RAMONA
Yeah, in the seventh grade
The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the
Balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK
RAMONA (CONT'D)
It was football season and for some
Reason, all the little jocks wanted
Me. Matthew was the only non-white
Non-jock boy in school, probably in
The entire state, so we joined
Forces and took 'em all out. We
Were one hell of a team. Nothing
Could beat Matthew's mystical
Powers. Nothing but pre-teen
Capriciousness. We only kissed
Once. After a week and a half, I
Told him to hit the showers

The spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel

SCOTT
Dude, wait...mystical powers?
Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona
MATTHEW PATEL
You'll pay for this, Flowers!
Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
If you want to fight me, you're not
The brightest. You won't know
What's hit you in the slightest
Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with
Fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
Me and my fireballs and my Demon
Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the
Talk because I know I'm slick
Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott
He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
Fireball Girls! Take this sucker
Down
The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott
Dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him
MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)
Let us show him what we're all
About
Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs
They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings
SCOTT
That doesn't even rhyme
Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and
Throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the
Eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish
MATTHEW PATEL
This is impossible, how can it be?!
Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time
To see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face
SCOTT
Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see
K.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS. They
Clatter to the stage floor. Scott lands and picks them up
SCOTT
Sweet. Coins
48 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 48
Ramona makes her way out fast. Passes Stacey

RAMONA
Well, it was great meeting you
Tell your gay friends I said bye
STACEY
Gay friends?
Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out
STACEY
WALLACE?! Not again!
Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara
49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49
Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them
SCOTT
Aw man. $2.40? That's not even
Enough for the bus home
RAMONA
I'll lend you the 30 cents
Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage
PROMOTER
Yeah...so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins
50 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 50
Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony
Her eyes scan the venue for Scott...but he is long gone
51 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 51

SCOTT
Sooooooo...
A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home
SCOTT
What was all that all about?
RAMONA
Uh, I guess...
Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes
RAMONA (CONT'D)
If we're going to date, you may
Have to defeat my seven evil ex's
SCOTT
You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
RAMONA
Seven ex's, yes
SCOTT
So I have to fight-
RAMONA
Defeat
SCOTT
-defeat your seven evil ex's if
We're going to continue to date
RAMONA
Pretty much
SCOTT
So, what you're saying is...
(BEAT)
We are dating?
RAMONA
Uh, I guess
SCOTT
Cool. Do you want to make out?
RAMONA
Uh...
Scott kisses Ramona. The studio audience 'awwww's
52 OMITTED 52
53 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 53
A bleary Wallace fries bacon. Scott bursts through the front
Door, a spring in his step. The studio audience applauds
WALLACE
Someone's happy
SCOTT
Well, someone got to second base
Last night. And someone has a
Second date tonight
WALLACE
Someone's lucky then
SCOTT
You know when I say '˜someone', I mean
Me, right? I got to second base last
Night...maybe first and a half
Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott

SCOTT (CONT'D)
Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for
Dinner, so you can't be here tonight
I don't want you gaying up the place
WALLACE
Okay, Scott. But in return I have
To issue an ultimatum
SCOTT
One of your famous ultimatums?
WALLACE
It may live in infamy...You have to
Break up with Knives. Today. Okay?
Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon
SCOTT
But...but...it's HARD
WALLACE
If you don't do it, I'm going to
Tell Ramona about Knives. I swear
To God, Scott
SCOTT
But you...you're...
At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and
Helps himself to coffee
JIMMY
Morning
Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly
SCOTT (CONT'D)
DOUBLE STANDARD!
WALLACE
I didn't make up the gay rulebook
If you have a problem with it, take
It up with Liberace's Ghost
SCOTT
You're a monster
WALLACE
Now put the bacon down and go do
Your dirt while I watch the Lucas
Lee marathon on TBS Superstation
SCOTT
Who's Lucas Lee?
Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of NOW magazine

WALLACE
He was this pretty good skater and
Now he's this pretty good actor

WALLACE (CONT'D)
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
Movie in Toronto right now
SCOTT
They make movies in Toronto?
WALLACE
Yes. I am stalking him later
SCOTT
So, this Lucas Lee-
WALLACE
Lucas Lee is not important to you
Right now! Get out
SCOTT
You suck. Surprising no one
Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We
See Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller
LUCAS LEE (ON TV)
Listen close and listen hard
Bucko. The next click is me hanging
Up. The one after that...is me
Pulling the trigger
54 EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY 54
A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone
SCOTT
Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want
To, like, talk or whatever?
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like
A spring jacket? And a hoodie?
SCOTT
Ummm...
Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
And a dorky hat?!
SCOTT
It's not dorky! Why are you psychic?
A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Oh. Uh...okay. Hi




INTEGRATED FINAL 47
55 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 55
The SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store
Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH
AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS
Posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist
KNIVES CHAU
I can't believe they're coming to
Town. Will you take me to the show?
SCOTT
Yeah, listen-
The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you
Over for dinner
SCOTT
Like, Chinese food?
KNIVES CHAU
Yeah
SCOTT
Hmm. It's not my favorite
KNIVES CHAU
Yeah. Well, to meet my parents
It's my birthday dinner
SCOTT
Uh...I think that's a really bad
Idea. Like, really, just so bad
KNIVES CHAU
No, it's okay. Why?
SCOTT
Well I mean, I'm too old for you!
KNIVES CHAU
No you're not! My Dad is nine years
Older than my Mom...
SCOTT
And...and...are you even allowed to
Date outside your race or whatever?
KNIVES CHAU
I don't care. I'm in...LOVE!

55 CONTINUED: 55
Knives is so smitten, the word actually appears onscreen
Scott brushes it away. The SPOOKY MUSIC comes to a stop
SCOTT
Um, listen...I was thinking we
Should break up or whatever

KNIVES CHAU
Really?
SCOTT
Yeah...um...it's not going to work out
KNIVES CHAU
Oh...
Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle
56 INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY 56
Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives
CROSSCUT with Knives still in the record store, in shock
ON THE BUS: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier...
CROSSCUT with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair
ON THE BUS: Scott smiles, a little happier
57 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' BASEMENT - EVENING 57
Sex Bob-Omb tune up. Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers
KIM PINE
Where's Knives? Not coming tonight?
SCOTT
Oh. No. We broke up
Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look
SCOTT (CONT'D)
OH! Check it out, I learned the
Bass line from Final Fantasy 2
Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune
KIM PINE
Scott, you are the salt of the earth
SCOTT
Aw, thanks
KIM PINE
Wait. I meant scum of the earth
SCOTT
Aw, thanks
YOUNG NEIL
You...you broke up with Knives?

SCOTT
Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll
Meet my new new girlfriend soon
YOUNG NEIL
Newnew
Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp
STEPHEN STILLS
Okay! From here on out, no
GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at
Practice, whether they're old, new
Or new-new. We were lucky to
Survive that last round. This is
Sudden death now. Okay?
SCOTT
Okay!
DINGY DONG...
SCOTT (CONT'D)
That's for me
Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Hey...you're here?
RAMONA
Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool?
Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development
SCOTT
You know your hair?
RAMONA
I know of it
SCOTT
It's all blue
RAMONA
Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going
To introduce me?
SCOTT
Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills
Young Neil, that's... Kim
RAMONA
Hey everyone
Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair

SCOTT
Is it weird not being pink anymore?

RAMONA
I change my hair every week and a
Half, dude. Get used to it
(to Sex Bob-Omb)
So...uh...how do you guys all know
Each other?
YOUNG NEIL
High school, I guess?
STEPHEN STILLS
What Neil said
YOUNG NEIL
I'm Neil
KIM PINE
Believe it or not, I actually dated
Scott in high school
RAMONA
Got any embarassing stories?
KIM PINE
Yeah. He's an idiot
Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again
SCOTT
Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow
STEPHEN STILLS
Uh, what about rehearsal?
SCOTT
Neil knows my parts
YOUNG NEIL
(TO STILLS)
I'm Neil
58 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 58
Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries
Around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on
WALLACE
Are you doing okay there?
SCOTT
Yeah, good. Good
Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act
SCOTT
She changed her hair

WALLACE
So? It looks nice blue

SCOTT
I know, but she changed it without
Even making a big deal about it
She's spontaneous. Impulsive
Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?
WALLACE
I can't believe you were worried
About me gaying up the place
Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket
RAMONA
How's dinner coming along?
SCOTT
Yeah, good. Good
WALLACE
I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm
Heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my
Hetero crush
Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper
SCOTT
Don't go
WALLACE
Will you man the hell up? You could
Get to 2nd and a half base
SCOTT
You think so?
WALLACE
Well, if you strike out in the next
Hour, come find me at the Castle
SCOTT
'œIf I strike out'?
WALLACE
Okay, 'œwhen'. See you in sixty
'15 MINUTES LATER'
Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has
Cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner
RAMONA
This is actually really good garlic bread

SCOTT
Garlic bread is my favorite food. I
Could honestly eat it for every
Meal. Or just all the time without
Even stopping
RAMONA
You'd get fat
SCOTT
No. Why would I get fat?
RAMONA
Bread makes you fat
SCOTT
Bread makes you FAT??
'15 MINUTES LATER'
A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar
SCOTT
So I wrote a song about you
RAMONA
Oh yeah?
SCOTT
Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona
Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona
Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh
RAMONA
I can't wait to hear it when it's
Finished
SCOTT
Finished?
'15 MINUTES LATER'
Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she
Runs her hands through his hair
RAMONA
Your hair's pretty shaggy
SCOTT
OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!?
Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback
RAMONA
What?
(CONTINUED)




INTEGRATED FINAL 53
58 CONTINUED: (4) 58
SCOTT
Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I
Got... I got a bad haircut right
Before me and my big ex broke up. But
It's so long ago, I can barely
Remember it...
A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep
NARRATOR
Scott is acutely aware that his last
Salon haircut took place exactly 431
Days ago, three hours before his big
Breakup. He blames this largely on the
Haircut and has been cutting his own
Hair ever since
RAMONA
Sounds like a bad time
SCOTT
Not really
NARRATOR
It was
SCOTT
It was a mutual thing
NARRATOR
It wasn't
SCOTT
I mean, she told me it was mutual
NARRATOR
She dumped him. It was brutal
RAMONA
What was her name?
SCOTT
She was Nat when I knew her. But
She stopped liking that name
Then...she stopped liking me...
RAMONA
Your hair is cute. I like it long
SCOTT
But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?!
Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing
His dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps
RAMONA
What? Why are you wearing that?

SCOTT
I thought we could go for a walk
59 EXT. ENDLESS STAIRWAY - NIGHT 59

'15 MINUTES LATER'
Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them
RAMONA
Tell me we didn't come out here
Just so you could cover your hair
With that hat
SCOTT
Nooo. I just love me some walking
Putting one leg in front of the other
RAMONA
You seem a little...heightened
SCOTT
Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
With you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
That I do drugs, unless you do, in
Which case I do drugs all the time
Every drug, but...you make me feel...I
Don't know. Things seem a little
Brighter around you or something
Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line
RAMONA
What is this place?
SCOTT
A totally awesome castle. They're
Shooting this movie up here
Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded
By big, bright movie set lights
RAMONA
Who's in it?
SCOTT
Winifred Hailey and some actor guy
RAMONA
Oh, who?
SCOTT
I forget. Let's find out




INTEGRATED FINAL 55
60 EXT. CASA LOMA - CONTINUOUS 60
A crew readies a shot of WINIFRED HAILEY held hostage by some
GOON. A STAND IN takes the place of the leading man. Scott
And Ramona approach some SPECTATORS, including Wallace
RAMONA
Did you find the guy you're stalking?
WALLACE
I think I'm about to right now
FIRST A.D
Mr. Lee is travelling!
RAMONA
Mr. Lee?
WALLACE
Lucas Lee
RAMONA
Ooh
SCOTT
Ooh?
The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits
His trailer, smoking a cigarette (blacked out). He skates
Towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'œoooh'
WALLACE
I want to have his adopted babies
RAMONA
Oh, man. We gotta go
SCOTT
What? Why?
RAMONA
I used to date that clown
WALLACE
Slut
RAMONA
Wallace. I am not a slut

WALLACE
I can think of no higher accolade
Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode
LUCAS LEE
Action
Lucas Lee points his board at the GOON
SCOTT
Oh...my...God...
LUCAS LEE
Hey. The only thing keeping me and
Her apart is the two minutes it's
Gonna take to kick your ass
SCOTT
...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!
RAMONA
In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually
It might have been math. I just
Remember there being lots of drama
LUCAS LEE
HEY!!!
Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious
RAMONA
He just followed me around. He was
A little snot nosed brat
SCOTT
He had snot? In his nose? But he's
Famous!
LUCAS LEE
HEY!!!
RAMONA
It's not a big deal. I only dated
Him for a week and a half-
LUCAS LEE
I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim!
Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps
SCOTT
He's famous and he talked to me!

LUCAS LEE
The only thing keeping me and her
Apart is the two minutes it's gonna
Take to kick your ass!
SCOTT
Can I get-
POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back
Up with a pen and paper, wobbly
SCOTT
Can I get your autograph?
POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona
LUCAS LEE
Sup. How's life? He seems nice
Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it
Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas
Holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps
Over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground
WALLACE
Scott. Evil ex. Fight

LUCAS LEE
Think you stand a chance against an
A-lister, bro?
Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down
Ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic
LUCAS LEE
Some competish you are
Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy
SCOTT
Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!
LUCAS LEE
Looks like you're seeing double
Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines
POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground
LUCAS LEE
He's good, right? Sometimes I let
Him do wide shots if I feel like
Getting blazed back in my winnie
Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
Dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble
LUCAS LEE
I'm nothing without my stunt team
The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
Through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style
WALLACE
Ask them how it feels to always get
His sloppy seconds!
SCOTT
How does it feel to-
KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
Barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs
LUCAS LEE
I'm gonna get coffee. You homies
Want anything?
We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear
The noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing
SCOTT
Mr. Lee?

60 CONTINUED: (4) 60
Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D
SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen
SCOTT
You're needed back on set
Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas
GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!
Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline
Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow
LUCAS LEE
Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath
Of the League of Evil Exes!
SCOTT
The League of Evil Axes?
LUCAS LEE
You really don't know about the
"The League"?
SCOTT
Ummm...
LUCAS LEE
Seven evil exes? Coming to kill
You? Controlling the future of
Ramona's love life?
SCOTT
...no
LUCAS LEE
Oh, well then don't worry about it
SCOTT
Really?
LUCAS LEE
Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer
Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets
Him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw
SCOTT
You are a pretty good actor
LUCAS LEE
I'm going for the Oscar this year
SCOTT
But are you a pretty good skater?

LUCAS LEE
I'm more than pretty good, ese
I have my own skate company
Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo
SCOTT
So you can sell them, but can you
Do a thingy on that rail?
Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs
LUCAS LEE
It's called a grind, bro
SCOTT
So can you do a grind thingy now?
LUCAS LEE
Are you serious? There's like 200
Steps and the rails are garbage
SCOTT
Hey, if it's too hardcore...
LUCAS LEE
You really think you can goad me
Into doing a trick like that?
SCOTT
There's girls watching
LUCAS LEE
Somebody get me my board
Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard
WALLACE
Hi. Big fan
LUCAS LEE
Why wouldn't you be?
CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail
Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight
Sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...
Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas
SCOTT
Wow
HSSSSSSSSS...
Cut back to Scott & Wallace, very impressed at Lucas

SCOTT
Wow
HSSSSSSSSS...
Cut back to Scott & Wallace. Scott's about to say '˜wow' when-
BOOOOOOOOM! A fireball appears from the bottom of the stairs
WALLACE
Wow, he totally bailed
SCOTT
Yes!
Fist bump. Scott smacks his forehead
SCOTT
I didn't get his autograph

FIRST A.D
Uh...that's a wrap everybody
SCOTT
Where's Ramona? Is she still here?
WALLACE
No, she totally bailed
SCOTT
What's the deal? Seriously
61 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY 61
Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace
Cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING
MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA
Is not available, please record your message after the beep
SCOTT
Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me
Back. Scott Pilgrim
(HANGS UP)
What's the deal? Seriously
Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it
WALLACE
Yeah, you said that last night
SCOTT
You know what really sucks though?
WALLACE
What?
SCOTT
Everything!
WALLACE
Come on guy, you can't say you
Didn't see this coming. It was
Right under your nose
Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned
Literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator:
RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx
WALLACE
What did you think these were?
SCOTT
Kisses? Seven little kisses?
WALLACE
Seven deadly X's

Wallace cocks an eyebrow. Scott slides to the floor
SCOTT
Why does everything have to be so
Complicated?
Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor
WALLACE
If you want something bad, you have
To fight for it. Step up your game
Break out the L-word
SCOTT
Lesbian?
WALLACE
The other L-word
SCOTT
Lesbians?
WALLACE
Okay, it's 'œlove'. I wasn't trying
To trick you or anything. Look, if
She's really the girl of your
Dreams, then you have to let her
Know. You have to overcome any and
All obstacles that lie in your
Path. You have the spirit of a
Warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be
With her! It's your destiny!
(BEAT)
Plus, I need you to move out
Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell
SCOTT
What? Why? Are you moving in with
Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?
WALLACE
Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of
Banking on her calling you back so
I won't have to evict you and feel
All guilty and shit
RINGY RING. Scott and Wallace look at the phone
WALLACE
I have a feeling that's for you, guy
Scott picks up. A SEXY, NON-RAMONA VOICE REPLIES...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey Scott

SCOTT
...Envy?
WALLACE
Oh, shit
ENVY (O.S.)
It's been a long time
SCOTT
Yeah
ENVY (O.S.)
A year I think?
SCOTT
Approximately
ENVY (O.S.)
How are you?
SCOTT
I'm not doing so good right now
ENVY (O.S.)
That's too bad. Still breaking hearts?
SCOTT
What? No, stop. I've been-it's been
Different. You have no idea
ENVY (O.S.)
Probably not. Do you have a
Girlfriend? Should I be jealous?
SCOTT
Yes, you should. I have this
Totally awesome girlfriend who
Calls me all the time. And she's
America. Uh. She's American
ENVY (O.S.)
What's her name?
SCOTT
I'm not telling you that. Ramona
ENVY (O.S.)
Oh
SCOTT
What? Do you know her?
ENVY (O.S.)
Uh. No

SCOTT
It sounded like you did
ENVY (O.S.)
I gotta go. Nice chatting with you
SCOTT
WAIT-
CLICK...Scott slumps to the floor. Wallace appears over him
WALLACE
Okay. Everything does suck
Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone
WALLACE
Or does it?
Scott sits bolt upright, expectant
WALLACE
Oh, hey Knives
Scott lays back down. FUCK
WALLACE
What's that? You're outside?
Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a
Crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking
KNIVES CHAU
Is Scott here?
WALLACE
You know what?
Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head
First. GLASS SMASHES
WALLACE (CONT'D)
He just left
Knives sighs. Scott sprints away in the background
A62 EXT. STREET - DAY A62
Scott walks fast down the street, freaked out and paranoid
He sees five '˜X's looming above him on a pedestrian crossing
And quickly diverts into an...

SHFFF - SOMETHING sweeps him off his feet. He's pissed now
SCOTT
I'm really not in the mood
SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott
SCOTT
Okay, enough!
Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A
DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up
Lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott
MYSTERY ATTACKER
You punched me in the boob. Prepare
To die, obviously
SCOTT
Listen, I've had it today. Can we
Not do this right now?
ALT #1:
MYSTERY ATTACKER
(DIXIELAND ACCENT)
Love to postpone, darlin', but I
Just cashed my last raincheck
SCOTT
What's that from?
MYSTERY ATTACKER
(OWN VOICE)
My brain!
SCOTT
Well whatever this is about, can it
Wait till I'm in the right frame of
Mind?
ALT #2:
MYSTERY ATTACKER
Nuh uh. This is one nightmare you
Can't wake up from
SCOTT
Wait, am I asleep right now?
MYSTERY ATTACKER
No
SCOTT
So, technically this is not a
Nightmare

MYSTERY ATTACKER
Right
SCOTT
So how can I not wake up? If I'm
Not actually asleep
MYSTERY ATTACKER
Don't question me!
Scott shakes his head, baffled
SCOTT
Well, I'm really, really not up for
This. Whatever it is
MYSTERY ATTACKER
Okay little chicken, then I'll see
You later. But you won't see me
Because I'll be deadly serious next
Time
SCOTT
What?
MYSTERY ATTACKER
Nevermind!
PAF - the Mystery Attacker vanishes. Scott looks to the sky
SCOTT
Oh man. Someone help me
63 EXT. BLOOR STREET - DAY 63
Scott is in his usual payphone, dialing Stacey frantically
SCOTT
It's Scott
STACEY (O.S.)
What did he do this time?
SCOTT
No, it's Scott. It's actually me
STACEY (O.S.)
What did you do this time?
SCOTT
I didn't do anything. It's everyone
Else that's crazy

SCOTT  (CONT'D)
Look I need to talk to you, I'm
Having a meltdown or whatever. Are
You still working?
STACEY (O.S.)
I'm literally about to leave
SCOTT
Cool, I'm coming in
Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into-
64 INT. THE SECOND CUP - CONTINUOUS 64
Scott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned
SCOTT
Think I'll make it a decaf today
Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!
JULIE
SCOTT PILGRIM!
SCOTT
AH! What did you do with my sister?
Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to
Go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy
JULIE
What can I fucking get you?
SCOTT
Is there anywhere you don't work?
JULIE
They're called 'jobs', something a
Fuckball like you wouldn't know
Anything about. And by the way, I
Can't believe you fucking asked
Ramona out after I specifically
Told you not to fucking do that!
(Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a
Black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.)
SCOTT
How do you do that with your mouth?
JULIE
Neverfuckingmind how I do it! What
Do you have to say for yourself?
SCOTT
Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato?

JULIE
Maybe it's high fucking time you
Took a look in a mirror before you
Wreak havoc on another girl
SCOTT
Me? Wreak havoc?
Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the
Counter with concert dates at the bottom
JULIE
Fucking speaking of fucking which
I hear the girl that kicked your
Heart in the ass is walking the
Streets of Toronto again
SCOTT
So I can pick up my coffee over
Here?
Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into...
RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor
RAMONA
Sorry that got a little crazy last
Night
SCOTT
Yeah. You kind of disappeared
RAMONA
Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know
It's hard to be around me
Sometimes. I'll understand if you
Don't want to hang anymore
SCOTT
No. No, I want to hang. The whole
Evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie
RAMONA
Exes
SCOTT
I mean, I know it's early days, but
I don't think anything can really
Get in the way of how I SHIT!
Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the
Steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop...the singer from THE
CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster
"ENVY ADAMS, 23, FUN FACT: KICKED SCOTT'S HEART IN THE ASS."

She wanted to move to Montreal

This guy Todd

Basically

Hey man, question. I always
Wondered, how does not eating dairy

You know how you only use ten
Percent of your brain? Well, it's
Because the other 90% is filled up
With curds and whey

You knew the science, maybe I'd

Oh. How about you give me the Cliff

Critical moment of not dying? Yes

I was only dating Lucas until the

Me. It was pretty crazy
Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy
RAMONA
A week and a half later, he told me
His Dad was sending him to the
Vegan Academy, so I dumped him
Does that help you at all?
The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect
SCOTT
Have you dumped everyone you've
Ever been with? You've never been

SCOTT
I'm not sure I can hit a girl
They're soft
RAMONA
You don't have a choice
Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES
With deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious
Volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces
ROXY
Fight your own battles, lazy ass!
PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona
Kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott
Into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor
ROXY (CONT'D)
Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his
Journey. Some sooner than others
Roxy lifts her leg over her head, preparing to drop her boot
Of DEATH on Scott's head. She grins at Ramona
ROXY (CONT'D)
Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!
RAMONA
Her weak point's the back of her knees!
SCOTT
What? How does that work?
RAMONA
Whenever we were making out, I-
SCOTT
Okay
As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
Lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee
GRAPHIC: 'œTICKLE TICKLE!'
ROXY
Oh...
Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic
Meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms
ROXY (CONT'D)
You'll...never...be able to do this
To herrrrrrrrrrr!
Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent
Scott is left standing in the middle of the room

Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona
Follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them
RAMONA
Sooooo...
SCOTT
Two gin and tonics please
RAMONA
I thought you didn't drink
SCOTT
Only on special occasions. Why? Did
You want one?
Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things
RAMONA
I guess we really don't know that
Much about each other do we?
Scott seems immediately drunk
SCOTT
Maybe you could just give me a list
Of all your exes so at least I know
Who's going to beat my ass into the
Ground next
RAMONA
Oh, like a handy little laminate or
Something? Let me see if I can find one
(looks through bag)
Maybe we could exchange our information
Scott has already downed his second drink
SCOTT
Just out of sheer curiosity and
Concern for my mortal well-being
Is there anyone at this party you
Haven't slept with?
EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY
HEY!
Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair
RAMONA
I really think we should split
SCOTT
As in '˜get out of here'? Or as in
'˜split split'?

SCOTT
How could I not? I feel like we just
Washed our sexy laundry in public
RAMONA
Dirty laundry. You're drunk
SCOTT
(holds up 2 fingers)
I've had like one drink
RAMONA
Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't
Enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm
Sick of it. I thought you might be
More understanding
SCOTT
I JUST-
RAMONA
You're just another evil ex-
Boyfriend waiting to happen
Ramona walks off and loudly announces
RAMONA (CONT'D)
And yes, there is someone at this
Party I haven't slept with. You
Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the
Room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party
But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST
RAMONA (CONT'D)
P.S. Here's your stupid list
Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-
'œPATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'
SCOTT
Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?
STEPHEN STILLS
You don't know?
83 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - NIGHT 83
Stills flips to hand drawn sketches of THE KATAYANAGIS
Identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops
STEPHEN STILLS
They're the next band in the battle
And they are badass

INTEGRATED FINAL 94

We reveal a grim, terse Scott playing a doomy bassline. The
Rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona
KIM PINE
Ramona dated twins?
SCOTT
Apparently
YOUNG NEIL
At the same time?
SCOTT
You know what? I don't know and I
Don't want to know
STEPHEN STILLS
Good. You know how I feel about
Girls cockblocking the rock
SCOTT
Good. I play better in a bad mood
STEPHEN STILLS
If it's gonna be an issue though
Young Neil can fill in for you
SCOTT
It's not an issue. You know bands
I know battles. We got it covered
STEPHEN STILLS
Well, we'd understand if you didn't
Want to take part
SCOTT
Not only do I want to take part. I
Want to take them apart
STEPHEN STILLS
Okay. I'm getting tingles
YOUNG NEIL
Whoa...

STEPHEN STILLS
Oh, we are going to get killed
YOUNG NEIL
Come on. You're onstage in five
SCOTT
Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on
First?
YOUNG NEIL
I think you're both on first?
STEPHEN STILLS
Wait...amp versus amp? We're going
On stage at the same time?
SCOTT
That's impossible-
85 INT. THE NINTH CIRCLE, STAGE - NIGHT 85

'œACTUALLY, NO'
Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a
MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB
With their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them
SCOTT
Okay. My bad
KIM PINE
Your bad is saying my bad
Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind
Their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned
Between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS
STEPHEN STILLS
We shouldn't even be here. We
Shouldn't even be here
Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back
SCOTT
Come on man! I put aside my
Problems for the music. If I can do
That, we can do anything
KIM PINE
Did you speak to Ramona then?
SCOTT
What? No. I haven't seen her since
The other night

KIM PINE
Oh. She's totally here

Kim points to RAMONA in the crowd. She is totally there. Her
Hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a
Nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses
They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again
KIM PINE
Scott? Not that I care...but you should
Talk to her before she's gone...
SCOTT
THANKS KI-
KIM PINE
And I really don't care
Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to
Find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then-
Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage
A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear
Sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands
KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN
KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese
Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look
STEPHEN STILLS
Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean
We can do this. Right?
KIM PINE
Right
STEPHEN STILLS
Scott?
Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him
KIM PINE
Scott!
Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting
An enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that
It shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the
Ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers
AUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.)
They brought the house down
Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth
Shaking BASS NOTE blows the dust off Sex Bob-Omb...
Scott and Stills get into battle position. Scott screams!

SCOTT
WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! WE ARE HERE TO
MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH AND GET
SAD AND STUFF! 1-2-3-4!
Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow
Towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome
Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up
To the Japanese character for 'œ11'. Their waveforms transform
The swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!
Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from
The amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS
SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers
Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments
STEPHEN STILLS
Let's break up now and get it over
With. We screwed the pooch in front
Of Gideon Graves. We're done
SCOTT
Gideon...is here? Where?
Stills points to the Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers
In Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE
SCOTT
That's Gideon?
Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He
Struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as
Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up
SCOTT
Alright. Let's do this!
Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in
Heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!
Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms
Transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI!
The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their
Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect
Beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music
The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in
Time to the music!
Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce
PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex
Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE:
85 CONTINUED: (4) 85
The Yeti picks up The Dragon and THROWS it at the Katayanagi
Twins, EXPLODING them and their amps into COINS
'œ+999 ROCKING'
KIM PINE
That...was epic
The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears
Hovering next to Scott
Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are
Gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil
STEPHEN STILLS
Scott. What are you doing?
SCOTT
Getting a life
Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-
Applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES
Standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt
KNIVES CHAU
I just came to see the show. I'm
Not even stalking you
Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause
SCOTT
You seem... different
Knives shrugs, different
KNIVES CHAU
I feel like I know stuff now
Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of
GREEN HAIR exiting the building
SCOTT
Ramona...
Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing
86 EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT 86
Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue
SCOTT
Ramona. I have something I need to
Tell you
RAMONA
Yeah, I have something to-

SCOTT
(RUSHED)
Great. Listen, I know you just play
Mysterious and aloof to avoid
Getting hurt. I know you have
Reasons for not wanting to talk
About your past. And I want you to
Know, I don't care about any of
That stuff. Why? Because I'm in
Lesbians with you
RAMONA
What?
SCOTT
I really, really mean it

RAMONA
Oh. Okay
SCOTT
What did you want to tell me?
RAMONA
That we have to break up
SCOTT
What?
RAMONA
Yeah...it's not going to work out
SCOTT
Oh okay...
A sleek black '˜61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind
RAMONA
It's Gideon. I just...I can't help
Myself around him
VOICE (O.S.)
That's the bad news
GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
Tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door
GIDEON GRAVES
The good news, Scottie, is I'm
Officially loving the Sex Bombs
SCOTT
Bob-omb
GIDEON GRAVES
Three piece rock outfit with a semi-
Attractive female drummer? Music to
My earholes
Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga
TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'œPEE'
GIDEON GRAVES
You know, I'm not even going to wait
To see how you guys do in the final
I'm signing you right now for a three

SCOTT
You think we're gonna sell our
Souls to you? Well then guess-
We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
Furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
It too, before trying to hand it back to Scott
SCOTT
Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
With this douche-in-charge
GIDEON GRAVES
Scottie, buddy, can I just say
Keep your emotions in check. Don't
Let what's past screw up your
Future
Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
Mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection
STEPHEN STILLS
The people need to hear us, Scott
SCOTT
Then you're going to need to find
Someone else to play bass
A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand
GIDEON
Looks like we're all set
Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
Round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder
GIDEON
Oh and Scott, we should really be
Thanking each other. I mean, if it
Wasn't for me, you would have never
Been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
For you, she wouldn't be back with
Me. So I guess it all shakes out
Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln
GIDEON
And hey, the whole League of Evil
Exes thing? I was in a dark place
When I put that together. Forgiven?
Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex
Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-
SCOTT
I said '˜lesbians'!

On a telephone pole. 'œTHONK'

Scott sits on the swings, staring straight ahead
Night turns to day. Day turns to night
Scott remains in the exact same position
STACEY (O.S.)
Was she really the one?
Scott looks over to see STACEY on the swing next to him
SCOTT
The wha?
STACEY
I mean, did you really see a future
With this girl?
SCOTT
Like...with jetpacks?
Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug
STACEY
Time heals all wounds, little
Brother. Maybe next time let's not
Date the girl with eleven evil ex-
Boyfriends
SCOTT
Seven
STACEY
Oh. Well that's not so bad
Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera
88 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 88
Scott enters. Flicks the light on. Gets a shock
SCOTT
Aaah!
WALLACE (O.S.)
TURN OFF THE LIGHT!
Scott flicks the light off. Over PITCH BLACK...
WALLACE (O.S)
Presumably you just saw someone's
Junk, and I apologize for that
VOICE (O.S.)
Sorry
SCOTT (O.S.)
Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or
Someone?
WALLACE (O.S.)
Or someone
VOICE (O.S.)
It's Chris
WALLACE (O.S.)
It's Chris
89 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - LATER 89
Scott sits in the chair, wrapped in a blanket. SOME GUY lies
In Scott's usual futon spot (wearing Wallace's monogrammed
Robe). Wallace hands Scott cocoa
WALLACE
Scott, you know I love you. But I
Need my own bed tonight. For sex
< b="">
Right
WALLACE
I may need it the rest of the week too
SCOTT
Right
And the year
SCOTT
I get it
WALLACE
Maybe you can move in with Ramona
Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head
SCOTT
She's with Gideon
WALLACE
Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's
Probably just because he's better
Than you
Scott nods
WALLACE
He'll certainly have better hair
Scott nods
WALLACE
Either way, I think this fight is over
Scott nods
WALLACE
You can sleep on the floor until
You get somewhere else to stay. I
Got you muffs and blinkers in case
This might happen
Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask
SCOTT
Thanks
RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up
SOME GUY
It's for Scott
SCOTT
(TAKES PHONE)
Hello?
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
Hey, pal. Just wanted to say I feel
Terrible about earlier. I don't
Want any hard feelings, so I
Figured why not be the bigger man
And give you a call
SCOTT
Is Ramona with you?
90 INT. GIDEON'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 90
Gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne. He calls off
GIDEON GRAVES

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
GIDEON GRAVES
Geez buddy, it's gonna be alright

No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S)
Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm
Opening a new Chaos Theatre in
Toronto and The Sex Bobs are
Playing our grand opening tonight
And it would feel really weird for
All of us if you weren't there
They just did a sound check and the
Acoustics in here are amazing
SCOTT
(GRIM)
Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there
GIDEON GRAVES
I hope so, amigo. I don't want
Anymore bad blood between ex's
What do you say?
SCOTT
Mm
GIDEON GRAVES
Okay laters
Click
WALLACE
What a perfect asshole
Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless
WALLACE
Forget what I said earlier. Finish him
92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92
Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a
Group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER
KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall
HIPSTER KID
Password?
Scott shrugs
SCOTT
Whatever
HIPSTER KID
Cool
The Hipster Kid waves Scott in

The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator
HIPSTER KID
Second password?
Scott gives the slightest shrug
HIPSTER KID
Cool
Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good
Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE
All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
Snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them
COMEAU
Yeah, their first album is so much
Better than their first album
Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
Playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
Bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song
STEPHEN STILLS
Scott!
Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates
STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)
Let it go. Don't give him the
Satisfaction
SCOTT
What if I want the satisfaction?
STEPHEN STILLS
Well, then you're doomed
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
Scott Pilgrim!
Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side
GIDEON GRAVES
Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
Theatre. Somebody get this man a
Drink! Coke Zero right?
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero
Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!
SCOTT
I'm not here to drink

I got no beef with you

SCOTT
You mean The League'?
GIDEON
Guild, League, whatever. It's
Ancient history
Gideon puts his arm around Ramona
SCOTT
I'll show you how ancient of
History it is
Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool
GIDEON GRAVES
No use crying over spilt Coke
Buddy. The lady made her choice and
We're all gonna have to move on
SCOTT
Well I ain't moving...buddy
GIDEON GRAVES
You want to fight me for her?
SCOTT
Was that not clear?
(to Sex Bob-Omb)
Was that not clear?
Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes
GIDEON GRAVES
Now why on earth do you want to do that?
SCOTT
Because, I'm in love with her
Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
Reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
Shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Scott earned the power of love...
Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles
GIDEON GRAVES
I think this deserves a song
Kimberly?

Kim scratches her head with her middle finger before
Grudgingly launching into a number
KIM PINE
We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to
Make money, and sell out and stuff
Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT
A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT
Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes
At them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS
Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon
GIDEON GRAVES
Ramona. My cane
Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle
He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there
Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends
Like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands
Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop
SCOTT
Your club sucks, by the way
Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow
GIDEON
If my cathedral of cutting edge
Taste holds no interest for your
Tragically Canadian sensibilities
Then I shall grant you a swift exit
From the premises. And fast
Entrance into HELLLLLLL
Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!
KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of
Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling
Down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles
GIDEON GRAVES
That is priceless
Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly
Recovers and POINTS a furious finger
KNIVES CHAU, 18 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: SCOTTAHOLIC'



KNIVES CHAU
You'll pay for what you did to him!
GIDEON GRAVES
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken, your old
Old boyfriend brought this all on
Himself. He was warned plenty of
Times. But did he listen? Did he f-
KNIVES CHAU
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking
To HER!
Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon
RAMONA
What?
KNIVES CHAU
YOU BROKE THE HEART THAT BROKE
MINE! GET READY TO CHAU DOWN!
Knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked Ramona!
RAMONA
You're kidding right?
Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights
Defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her
GIDEON
You can't say I don't know how to
Put on a show
GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's
Tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes
RAMONA
What the hell is your deal?
KNIVES CHAU
You stole him with your advanced
American slut technology
DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other
Throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE
RAMONA
I don't know what you're talking
About, I didn't steal anyone
Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off
The edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives
To Ramona and spins her away, separating them
SCOTT
Can we please stop all this
Fighting! Nobody stole anybody
Knives, I dated you and then I
Dated Ramona. Okay?
(BEAT)
I mean...maybe I kind of forgot to
Tell Knives right away, but...
KNIVES CHAU
Then you cheated on me, Scott!
(EYES NARROWING)
You cheated on both of us
Knives and Ramona both look at Scott, neither amused
RAMONA
You cheated on me with Knives?
SCOTT
No! I cheated on Knives. With you
RAMONA
Is there a difference?
SCOTT
You weren't wronged?
Scott breaks into a flop sweat
SCOTT
Right?
Knives and Ramona stare at Scott
GIDEON (O.S.)
Game over!
STAB! A sword pierces Scott's chest from behind
GIDEON GRAVES
Scottie. You can cheat on these
Ladies all you want, but you
Can't...cheat...death
Scott slides off Gideon's sword and falls to the ground...
TEXT WITH ARROW POINTING TO SCOTT: 'œDEAD'
Everything goes white...SAND blows through frame...Scott's
Eyes blink open. He looks up into a BLINDING BLUE SKY...
95 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - DAY 95
Scott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples
SCOTT
Ugh
Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before

RAMONA
I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks
SCOTT
You know what sucks? Getting killed
By THAT guy. Why him?
RAMONA
It's complicated
SCOTT
Well, maybe now would be the time
To get into it. Seeing as I'm about
To die
RAMONA
Alright... the truth is, it was me
Who was obsessed. I was crazy about
Him. But he ignored me. I was more
Alone when we were together than I
Ever was on my own. That's why I
Had to leave... and that's when he
Started paying attention
SCOTT
So why go back?
RAMONA
I can't help myself around him
Scott. He just... has a way of
Getting into my head
SCOTT
Well, that's legitimately
Disappointing. I really will leave
You alone forever now...
RAMONA
No. I mean, he literally has a way
Of getting into my head
Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a
Blinking CHIP implanted on her skull
SCOTT
That is evil
RAMONA
He's like that
Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair
SCOTT
So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?

RAMONA
I'm sorry it had to end this way
We had a good run, I guess
SCOTT
You can't say I didn't try. I
Really fought for you back there
RAMONA
Uh-huh
The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away
RAMONA
But someone was fighting pretty
Hard for you back there
Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany
SCOTT
Knives?
RAMONA
I wish I was ever as fanatically
Devoted to anything as that girl is
To you
Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand
SCOTT
I feel like I learned something. Which
Would be great if I wasn't dead
Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees
SCOTT
So...so alone
DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott
SCOTT
Ahhhhhh...
We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST
FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We
Hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart

HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN!
SOME GUY (O.S.)
Again?
WALLACE (O.S.)
Turn off the light!
Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...
SCOTT
Wallace, when my journey began, I
Was living in an ordinary world
Ramona skated through my dreams and
It was like a call to adventure, a
Call I considered refusing. But my
Mentor, that's you, told me if I
Want something bad enough I have to
Fight for it. So I did. There were
Tests, allies, enemies. I
Approached a deep cave and went
Through a crazy ordeal, during
Which I totally seized the sword
Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
Now I realize what I should have
Been fighting for all along. But
Before I do that, I need to ask one
Final favor of you
WALLACE (O.S.)
Sure thing, guy
SCOTT
Could you put a robe on and hand me
The phone?
Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone
SCOTT
Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon
Graves
(BEAT)
Tell him Scott Pilgrim is calling
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
Scott. I was just about to-
SCOTT
Hey, pal. I feel terrible about
Everything. I don't want any hard
Feelings, so I figure why not be
The bigger man and give you a call
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
Um...

Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-
SCOTT
Save it. You're pretentious, the club
Sucks, I have beef, let's do it
Scott goes straight into fight mode
GIDEON GRAVES
You want to fight me for her?
Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes
Scott, different than before
SCOTT
No...I want to fight you for me
Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-
Shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Scott earned the power of self-respect
SCOTT

Knives! I know you're in here!
Don't attack Ra-
Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head
SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK
They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES
KNIVES CHAU
Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel
Scott jumps between them, hands held out
SCOTT (CONT'D)
ENOUGH!
Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She
Kicks him in the face
KNIVES CHAU
No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and
I will have my revenge!
SCOTT
No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated
On you
Knives steps back, stunned
KNIVES CHAU
You cheated on me Scott?
SCOTT
I cheated on both of you. And I'm
Sorry. I was a different guy back
Then
Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona
SCOTT (CONT'D)
And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't
Mean that. So, are we all good?
Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks
RAMONA
Never felt better
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
Are we all done with the hugging

Fight going here
All turn to see GIDEON; bloodied, but still grinning, a

Oh, you got a fight alright
Scott steps into a fighting stance. Knives joins him

STRIKES A FIGHT POSE, the three of them ready to rumble
GIDEON (CONT'D)
Wrong move, baby
Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
With one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
Hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid
Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
Deflects them, SHING SHING!
Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
Looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins
GIDEON (CONT'D)
Yeah. You're still my girl
Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear
RAMONA
Let's both be girls
Ramona knees Gideon in the balls
Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
Scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him
Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of
FREEZE FRAMES
Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor
Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
Assault and grins
GIDEON
You made me swallow me gum. That's
Going to be in my digestive tract
For seven years!
Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
'œX' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD
He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
Dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
To BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'œX'
Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down
Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
Scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her
SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in

Sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE
Cancelling out Gideon's digital sword
Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
Tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom
Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon

Punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK
PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each

Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor
She kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
Wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning
Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
Glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott
GIDEON (CONT'D)
Who do you think you are Pilgrim?
You think you're better than me?
I'll tell you what you are. A pain
In my ass. You know how long it
Took to get all the evil exes'
Contact information so I could form
This stupid league? Like two hours!
Gideon starts to pixellate quite badly. Not long now...
GIDEON (CONT'D)

The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's
Fallen glasses
The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes
GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
You can defeat me...but can you
Defeat...yourself?
Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL
MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and
Scott whips around to face...
KNIVES CHAU
Negascott!
NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
Hair. Dark clothes. Evil face
Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance
SCOTT
No. This is something I have to
Face on my own
The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward
To confront his dark side
Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...
100-103 OMITTED 100-103
104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104
Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre
They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott
Then...
Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
Hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona
KNIVES CHAU
What happened?
SCOTT
Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit
He's a super-nice guy. We actually
Have a lot in common
Scott runs his fingers through his hair
KNIVES CHAU
Your hair

SCOTT
What?

KNIVES CHAU
It's getting really shaggy
Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked
SCOTT
Yeah?
KNIVES CHAU
I like it
Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
His guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles
SCOTT
You do?
Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
Her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness
Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives
SCOTT
Hey... Where are you going?
Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back
RAMONA
I dunno. I should probably
Disappear
SCOTT
After all that?
RAMONA
It's hard, you know? I came here to
Get away, but the past keeps
Catching up. I'm tired of people
Getting hurt because of me
Ramona looks at Knives as she says this
SCOTT
I think I understand
Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly
RAMONA
I should tahnk you, though
SCOTT
For what?
RAMONA
For being the nicest guy I ever
Dated

SCOTT
That's kind of sad
RAMONA
(ALMOST LAUGHING)
It is kind of sad
She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop
RAMONA
Well... Bye and stuff
SCOTT
Yeah. And stuff
She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-
KNIVES (O.S.)
Go get her
Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives
SCOTT
Wha?
KNIVES
You earned it. You've been fighting
For her all along
SCOTT
But what about you?
KNIVES
(totally sweet and sad)
I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
Anyway
She grins and kisses his cheek
KNIVES
There's someone out there for me
We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her
Guitar still in hand
We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame
Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-
KNIVES
Go talk to her. Before she's gone
Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-
SCOTT (O.S.)
Hey... mind if I tag along?

Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside
RAMONA
You want to come with me?SCOTT
(HOPEFUL) I thought maybe we could... try
Again?
Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
Earlier. Scott takes it
We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
Middle of the street, snow swirling around it
Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
Over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
To spring
Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
"Ramona" swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
Cell phone airwaves
JULIE
Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
With Gideon Graves at the grand
Opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
Was apparently awesome
STACEY (V.O.)
Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
Mean bananas. My little brother
Kicked a guy's head off. Literally
It was unbelievable. Someone
Seriously should have been filming
It
Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
Heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars

CONTINUE? 

Look, I was twenty seven when I got on, I was crazy late
But I knew my day was coming like I had a save the date
Starving at the table, I was staring at a paper plate
Played my cards right, and now look youngin, I crazy ate
Now everything I do hits, I never miss Jackson
If losing is normal, I guess I'm an outcast then
Director of my life, less chatting and more action
Married to a model, yeah, she thicker than an accent
Revenue is adding, thanks for asking by the way
Man, you probably saw an ad of me like seven times today
You need a beat for a cypher? OK, that's something that I can do
But you know I gotta be in it like Tobey and Andrew
Man, it took everything to get here, so fuck you noobs
Like Doctor Strange I swear I had to jump through hoops
Used to be black air forces, now it's custom shoes, bro
Ay Scru, we got one, so we yelling out Uno
Oh, it's supposed to be sixteen, I don't know what that shit mean
My art got no ceiling, what the fuck is the Sistine?
Rapper with no tats, I don't smoke and don't sip lean
But my numbers are high, lucky squad his team, Nato

They tryna take shots, but they better off shooting black rock
Scrape him after he cross me and peel like scabs on a black top
My sole is on his temple, he Red Skulled with a bad knot
Ducking Jakes like the Ice King, dogs bark in the backdrop
Step with crazy drive like I'm flying past with expired tags
Roll up out your lane, I ain't sparing shit, boy, I'm striking that
You speak a web of lies, bro, you only fly in a spider trap
I crush your snake head in the dirt, and get a diamond back
You a waste to rap around I'm tailored to speak to people
Hate turns brothers to demons, it's really root of the evil
In the field with no cleated sneakers, but been my brothers keeper
I got four and he don't, we split two and two like ballerinas
I strayed away from K's and mines, wild packs toting muzzled gats
Choppas that stutter static something like suffering succotash
Motherfuckers be cap, say I'm wack, nigga, stay real
Spit with a flow sick enough to hit 'em through face shields
You might also like
Foes all around me, pulling up, and they decapitated
Take their drip because I'm coming in hot, evaporated
Pick up something, and I throw it down, precipitation
Call me Thomas Tank Engine, rolling right up to your station
Let's flying at your crib like the hive, they be swarming
My ice so cold, I just solved global warming
I'mma say this shit once, I'mma give you one waring
Fuck around inside the Void then this shit gon' start burning
Your stomach, it starts turning, like butter, it starts churning
Taking you bitches to school, so it’s time they start learning
I'm rocking out popping, yeah, with the shotty, determine your fate, Shinigami
I'm in it, ay, who gon' stop me, ain't no single fucking body, lil' bitch

Opps spin his block for the colors just like a Rubix
Had a dream, it wasn't lucid, and now he about to lose it
He thought he had a blueprint, but was really moving foolish
Put your family on the line, now y'all bout to die as an unit
He wanna be a rapper, but didn't have the It factor
Wasn't Pennywise, so he sold his soul to his master
That was ill-advised, crazy you didn't realize
To maximize their profits know your worth is getting minimized, that's silly, right?
But that can't ever be apart of my prophecy
When I speak its money, every word a commodity
It's funny how it seems that they feign for my etymology
But I control the market, my product is my monopoly
My pen is a weapon, it's the rifle that I shoot
Gun so big, it look like something out of Doom
It go boom, poof, watch it empty out the room
The clip extending never ending when I empty out on you, ay
You call me a novelty rapper, but I beat you on every metric
That's a good reason why Scru gets me up on every guest list
'Cause he gets it, I treat a rap game like it's a game
I've been a Z-list celeb, and couldn't hack fame
It's the exact same shit I hated in high school
I prefer to sit at the nerd table than try to be cool
It's my surname, but I'm tired of the Bull, I am Dan
My pen game breaks necks by the letter, hangman
Tic Tac Toe, three X's in a row, that's hardcore execution
But I never speak a crossword 'till I've guessed the solution
Speak my peace from the chest, with each breath a chess piece is moving
To keep you in check, the best defense is improvement like
Do you know how lonely it gets when you're socially inept?
Used to try please people, but now I'm not overly stressed
I like to hide easter egg punchlines that nobody gets
Might not be a hood type, but I go over your heads

Uh, Scru done brought the sauce queen to stir the pot
They say: "Girl, just add a little", I tip the bottle, add a lot
Ay, manifest my dreams and they gon' take me to the top
If you write a list of legends better save me a spot
I hail from Grand Rapids, Michigan, already known for the flows
Just take a lap around the mitten, and you'll see why we're cold
Uh, built Ford tough, you can't afford it
Pushing to the forefront of these lines, you can't ignore me
Hundreds of Anime up in my repertoire, Nerd to the Core
But I'm Hip-Hop before a VA, so F your lore
If you've got a problem gonna have me acting out of character
Wait, wasn't that your problem? I'm in every single character
Ain't nothing mid, kid bout the Midwest
All direction on the compass, we encompass it best
Experimental with the mental, words are essential
My pen game beyond the quintessential, yours a rental
It's looking like they picked Murk to cook this cypher, hope you notice
I train to be Worldwide, you gotta local motive
I extort and railroad you niggas for blowing smoke
Or let you sleep with the fishes, whatever floats your boat
Take your pick like a nigga fro matted to his head
Same niggas ride same ones who ratted to the feds
I be in the club with thugs, the bitches finna roll in
Shout the homies in Europe, I had to bring the pole in
I took over the whole world when I stepped god
Now these kids loving the beast like I was Reptar
Son, you make it hard to pass time with them stress bars
And all of them ass lines like stretch marks
Yo, I was nervous when I first had hit the kill switch
Felt nauseous after I buss like I was Will Smith
Homie said it's kinda like school on his jail bid
Took it from the yard to the zoo like a field trip
I drill shit like a sharp blade through the tendon
Long graze'll split 'em this Shawshank, no redemption
It's tempting, I'm still sensing you want play for your vengeance
I press pens through the fences and parlay through the ending, it's Murk
Ayatollah, big brick smuggler
Bitch juggler, med server to sick customers
Put this beat in the cemetery bout six under you
Right up in that casket next to the Glizz guzzler, Murk!

Yeah, Nunn, Scru was adding that, ah

Walk with trauma, I told my partner to rest in peace
Got to live cause god done sent tests to me
Only trust my trust issues respectfully
I got pics, everyone dead in it, except for me
Pray for peace in a place that they pray on the weak
Check the check and pay your debt if you wanna eat
Don't catch a case and think you safe with police
Cause we know everything you stated came with receipts
From a hell hole where your soul is cheap
Where they hit the dog food just to go to sleep
I ain't running from police if they notice me
Got a bitch that stuff work by her ovaries
Slightly off, she don't often think
She get off the drinks and sniff the Xans like Carlton Banks
You survived the trenches, only god to thank
So the sideways shit we don't tolerate
It's an oath, it's a code, how it goes with me
We'll split the royalties for the loyalty
If I take a charge put it all on me
Would you get the J pay or the lawyer feeds?
All these hoes know I ain't cuffing, that's what y'all about
All that loving ain't bout nothing, you just stall 'em out
If I show your bitch what the god about
You'll lose your other half like slaughterhouse
Appeal solid, I don't do acetaminophen
I'mma start taking shots like Many Men
Slug will open your mind like a polygamist
Before I ever give you a voice like a ventriloquist
On ten, how I came in, now I'm ending it
Don't ever think your life infinite

Yeah, it's that enemy of the spellcheck having name ass rapper
That lame-ass bastard, "Lord, has he got no shame?" I'm past it
Claim to fame's Anime based but the stage? I smashed it
Manga ain't the only paper that I've made my habit
Actually I'm a savage, a monster made for the mic
Encased in baggage prolly got my momma praying for my life
I'm sick of taking advice about the way I should write
These old heads never get it, they just wasting my time
Think I'm fake, then I might just have to switch up like a lycanthrop
Rappers talk online, but got no life behind the microphones
Only cells they know are filled with nuclei and ribosomes
Tryna get my fam up out the dirt and hit new milestones
Yes, I'm a Geek, and I make no attempt to hide it
I grew up online, skin harder than hide, it's hard to deny it
Watched DBZ and MLP cause IRL wasn't the kindest
But now I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with fucking giants

Spot an opp in a hoopty coupe he driving
Shoot inside, his seat ain't move behind him, but that dude reclining
This shit get bloody out the blue like lies bout who you side with
Ain't ready when he wet up with the heat, he touring humid climates
I'm too defiant, you be dialing boys in blue to find him
Too late by the time he turnt in, I'm an overdue assignment
Strayed way down the wrong road like foreign Uber drivers
Steady deading GOATs, already said it, bro the Chupacabra
I'm not a human, dawg, I'm more an alien
I stole your spaceship and aim beams at you during a home invasion
These woozy bitches is lucy tripping, your hoes is basic
I'm straight saucing, so if you spilling, you know I'm staining
No negotiation, I ain't crossing T's or dotting I's
Know your place or I'ma dot your tee for crossing I
I lost my mind at an early age, now I murk the game
To earn my place at the top, while opps shine at the pearly gates, bitch

Lyrically I been a bad boy
In the night garden, I'm like Macca how I pack toys
Bars like Iggle Piggle how Itah oy, disrespect my bag choice
I be getting green from the East like it's Bok Choy
Gingerbread man, but I'm not made gingerbread
Do this for the clout like I quote tweet a Twitter thread
Embarrassingly recent the last time I went and pissed the bed
They be looking like Crusader Kings, how they into bread
Calliope, how I'm dead beat
They complain I'm reusing my bars, I'm eco-friendly
Only good in flashes, so my talents epilepsy
But the shit I make is deadly, I feel like I'm Elvis Presley
They be acting like I'm too evil, Avatar, how I blue people
Lyrically I have no true equal, fuck America, shoot eagles
Balls in my mouth like a Hungry Hungry Hippo
Bitch, I'm more impressive than a bag of fourty two Calippos

They gon' say who the fuck is this? Man, I never heard a drop from him
Meanwhile my music hit the charts on every continent
Kick back, feet off the floor, the flow auto man
Lease you every beat that I'm on cause y'all occupants
Hooked on my lines, oh my god, I'm fishing for compliments
I just swim on these cadences, alien to your oxygen while you
I'm a higher life form fusing consonants
I zoom in on your head and mute, remove you from the conference
Night night, and I ain't talking Doctor Sues
Siren on the hood, the life I'm chasing, I'm in hot pursuit
Guile on another level, 808's that Sonic Boom
You said you leaving Earth, well motherfucker, I am on the Moon
Space man, talking shit, I'll push your wig back, king space jam
Heat to your noodle, let it rain Mac, what did he say?
Question DPS, what if you were featured and your verse, it didn't go?
Well, I guess the world will never know

Ladies and gentlemen, guess who's back? Haha! Aww, man

Catch a hundred like Eddie Mcdowd if you even sniff or bark
Whether a Kay, Nine or a Bulldog, you getting dogged
When it's war, niggas getting flipped cause they think they raw
So stand in the kitchen or get lifted off the kitchen floor
Click it and pull it, riddled with bullets when gats blam
You in a pickle, they riddled you more than the Batman
Zab hands, these jabs land, all in your cat scan
If you attack fam, fam move like the Black Hand
My black hands have been worked to the bone, it's feels worse than you on
I'm two seconds from snatching a necklaces or bursting in homes
To who this may concern, don't even trip, these just words to a song
Bursting your dome, tool to your roof like we servicing homes
The search for the throne is getting crazy right now
Up the baby, it's bout to get real Da Baby right now
Yo, the next YouTuber caught talking bad on the Blacks
Getting Will Smith palm smacked the next Con or Pax
Donkey slapped, thrown threw a manga booth, all of that
Then two guys in hockey mask slam your ass through a Baki rack
And fuck all that: "we ain't know better", bitch, we on to that
Bet the fish ain't know the shark was there till it caught his ass
Spark his ass, mark his ass, Krillin, six dot his ass
Put the beam where his heart is at their Tony Starked his ass
Marksman fast, first person moving getting handled first
Cause when it comes to shitting on you actors, I'm Amber Heard
For the bag, niggas on your roof, doing Santa work
Like Lil' Wayne's the cannon verse, you gon' hear The Cannon first
Cause bitch, I got Dedication Two, and I plan to work
To new boys I am a jerk, when death is near, I plan to flirt, 
1 ContributorParty Beat Lyrics
I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna
Go-o-oo
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna

This is the time and place
To let time slip away
No need to be dismayed
Too Indecent here to stay
Can't describe this with no adjective
All natural, no need for additives
This dance floor I am mastering
DDay, the beat is disastrous
Earthquake the floor, finna wake a morgue
New year, new day, what you waiting for?
Get a grip, grab a hold, take a sip, I was told
“You never know if you don't go” so
Step to rhythm and feel for the beat
No, not enough houses so we gathered in the street
Getting down to this New Year jam
Don't be a stranger, let me see them hands

Go-o-oo
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna
Go-o home
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna go
I don't ever wanna

Uh, back at it like a crack addict (what?)
Higher than Breaking Bad addicts
And pretty sharp, so I took a stab at it
About to snap like a bad habit
I'm as bright as high beams, need Visine
My eyes think I'm Chinese
Every scene on TV is in widescreen
Tread lightly, line leaders are behind me
In both space and time
My place in mind is running at a pace with no peace in mind
This piece of mine isn't at my side
It's in front of my tongue ripping any beat I find
At the forefront, Colonel of Cadence with a
Rhythm that'll make Rip Van Winkle wake up
Lyricism is the reason that I speak up
If someone gives you a mic you better keep up

Remember back when I was tryna get a scholarship
Callin some coaches I was on some fuckin baller shit
My skills were slippin’ but I turned right round and polished it
Workout and drills I shoot to kill know I demolished it
I told my granny I had dreams of playing NBA
She told me focus and go study get my MBA
I said okay I’m on my way to university
I had that roc with me as if I had a verse from Jay
Hit the weight room and gym time for practice
Swear I was working fucking hard as if the cracked whips
God come and subtract this pain know I need it mane
I’m running hills all in the rains my friends call me insane
It’s friday night they hit they parties I stay inside
Gotta stay fresh no alcohol up in my insides
Plus practice starting in a week I gotta hit the sheets
All Eyes on Me CD in player then I press repeat
That next friday sun is rising I’m already up
I grab my lucky Kobes hanging right next to my chucks
Got to the gym I say round ten
Nothing but smiles and grins
I saw some homies shake some hands and now I’m making friends
We doin drills I’m killin muhthafuckas left and right
I gotta be starting right?
Cause a nigga hungry like some leftovers and appetite
Thats when I started seeing that these coaches ain’t acting right
Got these niggas starting and I swear that they not half as nice
Politics
Tell me what’s the cause of this?
I’m the one thats dunking every play and dropping jaws and shit
Now I’m feeling nauseous bitch
Plus I’m not myself now
Used to be a water bottle now bottles on shelves now
You know how I felt now
I’m thinking of transferring
But that means lost credits, student loans, and fucking grants again
I’m crying to God but it seems like he’s not answering
Now the doubt is spreading through my body like some cancer man
Last game of season coach put me in for some seconds
Told me hold the ball now I can’t get no fucking rec in
Them seconds on the clock started to look like my career
I had to tuck my chin so they won’t see me shed a tear
And then the buzzer sound hit the lockers it was over
Coaches saying thank you and they’ll see me in October
I hit some other schools and coaches
I ain’t have no tape
Friends say I’m moving too fast and I need to press the breaks
I call em’ all fakes cause it ain’t really what it seems
Ready to lose it all for these fucking Hoop Dreams Muhthafucka

But you gotta fight through that man
Don’t let nobody tell you can’t go chase your dreams nigga

In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed.Scarface
By: Oliver Stone
"Enjoy yourself -- every day above ground is a good day. - ANONYMOUS, MIAMI 1981
1 A PROLOGUE
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.
NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'
The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

4 THE LANDING - KEY WEST
The flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an "America the Beautiful"-type Immigration theme surging over this.
5 THE PROCESSING
Long lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.
Babies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being
interviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,
families huddled on floors... chaos.
The music theme continuing in stately calm as we:

A FULL and CLOSEUP OF
7 TONY MONTANA 7
the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.
Over this:
VOICE #1 (o.s.)
Okay so what do you call yourself?
VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?
MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?
VOICE #1
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?
MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...
VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?
MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...
VOICE #1
Mother?
TONY
She's dead too.
VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?
TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....
VOICE #2
Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?
TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.
MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?
TONY
Me jail? No way.
We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.
MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?
TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.
MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?
TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?
MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.
The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.
TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.
MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?
TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.
His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.
MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?
TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)
MAN #3
And this?
He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word "Madre"
scaled through it.
TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.
MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?
TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.
MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.
TONY
Some Canadian tourist....
MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)
TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?
Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.
MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?
MAN #3
(walking out)
I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.
TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.
Man #3 at the door stops, looks back.
TONY
Send me here, send me there. This.
That. Nothing you can do to me
Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A
The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.
Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.
MANNY
Seat's taken.
TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.
Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,
TONY
So what'd you tell them?
MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.
TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.
The bus pulling out now.
MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.
TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.
MANNY
Fuck you Tony....

You did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.

A movie projector...
...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....
The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.
BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.
Time to go to sleep.
(closes his eyes
but not for long)
CUT TO
9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9
Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.
TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?
MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!
TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....
He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.
TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.
MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.
TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.
MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....
TONY
I know.
MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.
TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!
MANNY
Yeah, sure.
TONY
Hey, c'mon.
Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.
CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.
MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.
CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.
MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....
CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---
MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?
CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.
MANNY
A real snatch?
CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.
As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. "Later."
He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.
He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a "Viva Carter!" proclamation in graffiti....
TRANSVESTITE
(passing)
What about you sugar -- you wanna party?
TONY
(passing her)
Yeah with whose cock, honey?
CUT TO
10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.
Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.
Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.
TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?
ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!
TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.
ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.
Manny catches up to Tony.
TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?
MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,
TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.
Angel comes over, listens.
MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!
TONY
Oh yeah?
MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.
TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.
MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.
ANGEL
Oh shit!
MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....
TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!
MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?
TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?
Tony winks and walks off.
The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.
TONY

'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'

11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move

TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....
The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.
MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!
Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.
ANGEL

Hey Tony where ya going?
TONY
I got better things to do.
ANGEL

MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?
TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?
Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.
MANNY

Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.
TONY

now goes up in flames.
25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.
Manny runs up on him.
Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.
Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.
TONY
Rebenga!
Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.
TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!
The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.
...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.

27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:
HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!
Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...
Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: "Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?"
Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.
TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?
MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.
TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?
MANNY
Yeah.
TONY
Millionaire.
MANNY
How do you know?
TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.
MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...
A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.
TONY
Hey baby what you say?
She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.
Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.
MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!
He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.
TONY
...the fuck was that?
MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.
Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.
TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.
MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.
Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.
MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....
TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?
Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.
MANNY
No problem.
27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.
TONY
Come on?
Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.
TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.
The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.
Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.
She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.
Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.
Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.
Tony walks over to him, mocking.
TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.
MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....
As they walk off, backs to camera.
TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?
MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.

28 LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT
on Southwest 8th Street. "Calle Ocho"....
The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.
The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.
The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....
. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.
TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.
MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?

29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.
MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.
TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?
MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...
TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.
(looks at his hands)
Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.
His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.
COOK
(Spanish)
Hey you two, outside! You got company...
MANNY
That's him -- El Mono's here!
TONY
(contemptuous of the name)
El Mono? Shit....
CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- "The Monkey") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.
MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....
Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.
OMAR
I got something for you.
MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?
OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.
MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.
TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?
Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.
TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.
MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...
TONY
Shaddup!
Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.
OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?
TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.
Steps forward. Manny grabs him.
MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....
In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.
OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.
WALDO
What about them Indians ---
The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.
OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?
TONY
You kidding.
OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.
MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...
Tony says nothing.
OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?
MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.
OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...
MANNY
No problem.
OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.
Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.
TONY
I'm scared.
MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.
TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.
MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?
TONY
So what does it matter?
MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?
Tony strips off his greasy apron.
TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!
COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.
TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.
Throws the Cook his apron.
COOK
(Spanish)
What the fuck you gonna do!
TONY
Look after my investments.
CUT TO
31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.
The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.
32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.
Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.
MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!
At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.
CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.
MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....
Camera revealing the teenager.
TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.
MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?
ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.
MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?
ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.
As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.
MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,
CHI-CHI
Angel?
ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...
TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.
Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.
TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.
TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?
ANGEL
Sure thing.
As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:
TONY
Let's go....
CUT TO
33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked "9". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.
34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, "The Toad". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.
TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....
Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.
35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.
TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?
The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.
The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.
TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?
Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.
TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.
TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.
TOAD
I'm Hector...
Pause.
TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.
TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.
TONY
You know Omar.
TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.
TONY
Okay...
TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?
TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?
TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.
TONY
Yeah well I don't got it either, I
got it close by, too.
TOAD
Where, in the parking lot?
TONY
No. How far's your stuff?
Tony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel
out... The Lizard staring at him...
TOAD
Not far.
Pause. Everything seems okay.
TONY
So what do we do, walk in and start over?
TOAD
(changes subject)
Where you from?
Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.
TONY
What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?
TOAD
I like to get to know who I do business with.
It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
move somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,
coiled and always watching.
TONY
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.
TOAD
Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...
TONY
Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?
36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
commotion.
ANGEL
Tony!
Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek, like a bird.
LIZARD
(slang Spanish)
Don't! Get up! Now shithead!
She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.
The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
Columbians, "The Kids".
They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.
As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:
TONY
Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.
Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.
TOAD
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?
TONY
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits
Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins
assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.
CUT TO:
37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across
the street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.
38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.
39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny looks at his watch.
CUT TO
40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.
Tony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
bathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
Angel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're
dead and they know it.
Toad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.
TOAD
(to Tony)
You watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.
Lizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who
nods and turns on the whirring machine.
The Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly
towards Angel.
The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his
brains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.
Lizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.
The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.
TOAD
Now the leg, hunh?
A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.
CUT TO
41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They
signal and separate.
CUT TO
42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.
Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.
TOAD
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.
He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
his blood, piss dead.
CUT TO
43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
notice.
At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...
CUT TO
44 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - 'DAY
The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
shower.
The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.
TOAD
Last chance, carajo?
Tony, devastated, spits in his face.
TONY
Go fuck yourself.
Toad's eyes narrow meanly.
Kid one slaps the tape across Tony's mouth.
Kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to Tony's
wrist.
The Toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly there's a
gunshot from the hall.
45 INT./EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.
Manny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid
one, who is turning, in the neck.
Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.
The Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.
Manny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.
Manny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.
The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
In sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.
Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.
In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.
Chi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.
Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.
He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.
Tony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.
TONY
I got him!
Manny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.
Chi-Chi sees Angel, gags.
CUT TO
46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46
The senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter
in astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.
Their eyes follow.
As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts. He stands behind the Toad.
TONY
(Spanish)
Your turn, cabron!
The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.
Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.
The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then
an old lady faints.
The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.
CUT TO
47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.
TONY
Manny, you okay?
Manny nods.
TONY
Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!
CHI-CHI
Si!
48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM
Tony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
and busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.
Inside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.
He shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.
CUT TO
49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Chi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony
hurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)
Past the senior citizens who are retreating inside their
rooms.
The camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars
come screaming past them from the opposite direction.
CUT TO
50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
The booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.
TONY
Yeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.
OMAR'S VOICE
(shaken)
Look, let me check it out right away!
TONY
You do that, Omar, you do that.
OMAR'S VOICE
You got the money?
TONY
Yeah -- and I got the yeyo.
OMAR'S VOICE
You got the yeyo? Bring it here.
TONY
Fuck you. I'm taking it to the boss myself. Not you. Me.
OMAR'S VOICE
Okay, okay. All right. Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway. Look, meet me tonight at Hector's at eight.
TONY
Hey Omar...
OMAR'S VOICE
Yeah?
TONY
That was some pick up you sent us on.
Pause.
OMAR'S VOICE
What's that mean?
Tony hangs up, walks back to the sedan.
CUT TO
51 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - NIGHT
on Bricknell Avenue in a swank high-rise district adjacent
Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, the hub of South Miami...
The doorman shows Omar, Manny, his side bandaged, and Tony, carrying the suitcase, through giant glass portals, past seriously armed security cops in the lobby.
52 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52
A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.
The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.
LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?
TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.
LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.
TONY
Okay Frank.
Frank shakes hands with Manny.
LOPEZ
Howya doing?
MANNY
(awed)
...Fine yeah.
TONY
Manny Ray, he was with us on the job.
LOPEZ
(to Manny)
I hear you caught one?
Manny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.
MANNY
Just the flesh. Went right through.
LOPEZ
(heading for the bar)
Yeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.
TONY
(glances at Omar)
Yeah. Omar's terrific.
LOPEZ
Not to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.
TONY
You don't have to mention it. That was fun.
LOPEZ
(smiles, likes the kid's balls)
Scotch? Gin? Rum?
TONY
Gin's fine.
LOPEZ
(pouring)
Yeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.
TONY
Yeah... well.
Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.
TONY
...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.
(produces the money)
It's my gift to you -- from me.
Pause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.
LOPEZ
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....
He glances hard at Omar who squirms.
Without opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes
the suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.
LOPEZ
Don't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!
They drink the toast. With their eyes.
LOPEZ
Then you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.
(drinks)
TONY
Yeah, I hope I have that problem someday.
Lopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.
LOPEZ
Where the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?
The big bodyguard exits smoothly.
LOPEZ
(to the others)
The broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.
TONY
I guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?
Lopez laughs.
LOPEZ
Yeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?
(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)
TONY
Yeah sure, I could eat a horse.
ERNIE
Here she comes, Mr. Lopez.
TONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.
LOPEZ
Oooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.
She doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.
**ALTERNATIVE**
LOPEZ
Where you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.
ELVIRA
You're always hungry, you should try starving.
Lopez laughs.
LOPEZ
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.
ELVIRA
Hello.
TONY
Uh... hi.
MANNY
(equally impressed)
Yeah, hi.
ELVIRA
I assume we're going to be a fivesome.
Where are we having dinner?
FRANK
Oh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.
ELVIRA
Again? If anyone wanted to assassinate
you, you wouldn't be too hard to find.
LOPEZ
(coming toward her, laughing)
Me? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.
ELVIRA
You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.
Neatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.
ELVIRA
Come on, Frank, let's go.
Tracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.
Lopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.
LOPEZ
Okay, let's go.
CUT TO
54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.
55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
The interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.
The crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
young, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, "Celebrating" or "Partying Down Tonight".
The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
and high heels.
Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.
Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
tough-looking tank tops with "Motherfuckah" and "Fuck Me"
written on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.
MANNY
So whaddaya say, hunh?
He flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.
CHICK
You got a buck?
MANNY
Sure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?
CHICK
(indicates the machine)
Put it in, let's play.
MANNY
I had other things in mind.
CHICK
You check out on this and we'll talk about other things.
MANNY
(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)
Fuck, how do you play this thing?
CUT TO
56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56
Frank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug
of champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.
LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Over there that's Ronnie Echeverria.
Him and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....
Their point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.
LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.
Their point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.
LOPEZ
...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....
Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.
LOPEZ
. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?
TONY
'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?
LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.
ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.
The girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.
LOPEZ
That's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.
(eyeing Elvira)
HEAD WAITER
There you go, Mr. Lopez.
He's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.
LOPEZ
Give it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?
Head Waiter nods.
LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Five hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?
ELVIRA
(to Tony)
In France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.
Tony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.
57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
A Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.
LOPEZ
Hey, George -- buddy.
MAN
Hey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?
The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.
LOPEZ
Oy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.
SHEFFIELD
Jack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.
LOPEZ
Yeah, almost everything.
SHEFFIELD
(to Elvira)
Elvira, you look terrific...
(to all)
Enjoy yourselves.
He ambles off.
LOPEZ
. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.
Tony looking off at him, remembering it.
LOPEZ
(raising his champagne glass)
So... here's to old friends...and new friends.
They toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.
LOPEZ
Well, Tony?
TONY
Hey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.
Lopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.
LOPEZ
(checking Tony's threads)
Yeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.
Omar doesn't like it but glances away.
TONY
Hey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.
The music shifts to slow dancing.
ELVIRA
(waving away cigar smoke)
So, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?
LOPEZ
Dance? I'd rather have a heart attack.
ELVIRA
(rising)
Don't foam into the Dom Perignon.
Glancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.
ELVIRA
(to Tony)
How about you?
Tony nods sure, looks at his boss.
LOPEZ
(waves)
Go on!
They go.
58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.
LOPEZ
(to Omar)
What do you think?
OMAR
I think he's a fucking peasant.
LOPEZ
Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.
CUT TO
59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59
Tony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel
dance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in
the legs and shoulders.
TONY
...so what's your name, Elvira what?
ELVIRA
St. James.
TONY
Elvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?
He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.
ELVIRA
Baltimore...
TONY
Baltimore? Where's that?
ELVIRA
Look, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.
TONY
Just trying to be friendly.
ELVIRA
I've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.
He makes a point of looking at her.
TONY
Hey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.
ELVIRA
Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?
Tony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.
The man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony
doesn't see.
TONY
Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?
ELVIRA
(interrupting)
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.
TONY
Why you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?
Elvira laughs at him, furious.
ELVIRA
You know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.
TONY
(interrupting)
Now you're talking to me, baby!
ELVIRA
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.
TONY
Hey, thataway.
She whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.
CUT TO
63 CAR - DAWN
Tony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.
They've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.
TONY
That chick he's with... she loves me.
MANNY
(driving)
Oh yeah, how you know that?
TONY
The eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.
MANNY
You're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.
TONY
What are you kidding -- he's soft.
I seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.
Pause.
63-A OMITTED
64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:
HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!
Past banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...
Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the
American flag and the reminder: "Will the last American
leaving Miami please bring the flag?"
Tony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.
TONY
I shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...
MANNY
I want a line of bluejeans with my name on the
chicks' asses.
TONY
Yeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,
We never gonna score the big money working for Frank.
MANNY
Frank's okay.
TONY
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit? You thinkin' like
a chickenhead again
MANNY
Frank's got an organization.
TOW
Organization? I got more brains than Omar and he's bigger than me, That's not an organization. That`s a disorganization. What do you do for a brain man? Piss in it?
MANNY
Fuck you, somebody oughta shoot you, put you outta your misery
(seeing something)
Hey catch this tomato
Catching the eye of one of two young Girls passing, Manny
primps for them.
MANNY
Ooooh baby doll
TONY
Yeah, what do you girls say? you manna have some
ice cream with us somewhere?
They glance at Tony and Manny and hurry on.
Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.
MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!
He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.
TONY
...the fuck was that?
MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.
Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.
TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin',
MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you did know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.
Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
provoking Manny's laughter. Manny double checks himself in a shop window.
MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sengre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it...
TONY
Oooh ...cono! How 'bout that one?
Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.
MANNY
No problem.
EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.
TONY
Come on!
Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.
TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.
The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.
Manny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.
She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.
Tony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.
Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.
Tony walks up to him, mocking.
TONY
I'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.
This country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls. Por Los cojonesl
MANNY
Hey Tony, last time this year you was in a fuckin' cage in Cuba. Why don't you take it easy Chico, slow down, one step at a time, be happy what you got you know? You get on your death bed you look around you think to yourself, when was I ever happy?
Camera moving with Tony as he glances in an elegant window displaying jewelry.
TONY
You be happy. I want what's comin' to me when I'm alive not when I'm dead.
MANNY (shakes his head)
Yeah, what's comin' to you Tony?
TONY
The world man, and everything in it.
As he goes into the store, the camera panning to the diamonds in the window.
CUT TO
65 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY
The house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.
66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY
From his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced
up and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of
gifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.
TONY
Be back in an hour okay.
MANNY
Okay... be cool.
Tony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.
67 EXT./INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
Tony's Mother opens the door.
A stout aging woman with a powerful face, she's shook to her roots.
TONY
(gently, in Spanish)
Mami... long time....
MAMS
No postcards from jail, hunh?
He doesn't offer to kiss her nor she him.
Pause.
Someone else is in the house. Mother looks behind her.
She opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.
He steps in. He looks.
68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.
Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.
TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina...
GINA
Tony?
She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)
TONY
(covering his unwanted emotion)
Yeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....
He holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.
TONY
I got this for you, no big deal but....
GINA
Oh Tony!
Gina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his
arms, grasping him fiercely.
GINA
...it's you!
Tony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.
GINA
I never thought I'd see you again -- never!
Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.
TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?
Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.
TONY
...Yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
"To Gina From Tony. Always."
GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....
The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.
TONY
...for you too Mama, look....
Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.
GINA
It's beautiful... Mama,
(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')
Mama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.
TONY
(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)
Well anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!
Tossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a
bottle of champagne.
TONY
Oye ! To America!
(singing)
'America. America....'
CUT TO
69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,
as Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.
GINA
. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?
Tony nods.
GINA
It's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...
TONY
Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
with starting today. I didn't bring
up my kid sister to work in no hair
shop....
Mama looks over at him on the words "bring up" and he
catches her look.
TONY
...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.
He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
starts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,
looks.
TONY
(to Mama as he counts)
Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise
you. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.
Pushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.
TONY
That's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.
She approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the
bills, then looks back at her son.
MAMA
Who'd you kill for this Tony?
GINA
(aghast)
Mama!
TONY
I didn't kill nobody Mama,
(lying)
MAMA
No? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?
TONY
C'mon Mama. Things are different.
I'm working with this anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....
MAMA
Sure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....
GINA
(springing to her feet)
What are you saying Mama! He's your son!
MAMA
Son? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a
bum now!
(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)
Who do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....
TONY
Hey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....
MAMA
(continuing)
No, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --
(emphasizing it)
I raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy
money with you, it stinks!
She casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him
like dead lettuce.
A silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.
GINA
Oh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.
(to Tony)
I'm sorry Tony, I....
Tony nods his head at his mother.
TONY
(gently)
Okay, Mama, okay....
CUT TO
70 EXT. TONY'S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 70
Tony walks out icily.
MANNY
(waiting in the car, seeing his expression)
Relatives, hunh? A pain in the ass,
they ---
TONY
Shaddup!
He's climbing into the car when Gina hurries out the house.
GINA
Tony!
MANNY
Hey who's that?
Checks himself in the rearview mirror, slicks his hair.
Tony and Gina talk next to the car.
GINA
Tony-.-Mama -- since Papa took off....
TONY
Hey forget Papa, we never had one, okay? He was a bum!
GINA
(continuing)
. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?
TONY
(making light of it now)
Hey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.
GINA
Tony, I know you did some bad things
back then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.
TONY
Communists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.
GINA
Mama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.
Pause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.
TONY
Hey I know... I know.
She gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.
TONY
Say, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?
She hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.
TONY
Go on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?
He gets in the car. She peers in.
GINA
You can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?
Her eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.
He smiles back with charm.
Gina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw. The sedan drives off.
71 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 71
MANNY
(driving)
cone, you -never told me you had
Hey,

Sure...sure.
A beat.

Music accompanying the flipping of calendar leaves.
73 U.S. CUSTOMS - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 73
Tony, spruce in his new three-piece suit with the diamond on
the finger and the expensive watch, looks like the young
ethnic American businessman in import-export as he steps in
front of a chunky, young Customs Officer, who looks at him coldly.
CUSTOMS OFFICER
Mind opening that, sir?
Tony, calm, unzips the chic leather single suitcase, his
eyes drifting around....
A woman, with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage, is cursorily checked through an adjacent line.
A nun is waived through the third line.
A stockbroker waiting in a fourth line, glances nervously in Tony's direction.
Tony looks away, back at the Officer who is thoroughly
ransacking the suitcase looking for a false bottom. He waits, confident.
An old man is waived through a fifth line,
75 EXT. DOLLY STASH'S HOUSE - MIAMI - DAY 75
The mother-type unscrews the handles of the baby carriage,
pulling out the wrapped cocaine, while Chi-Chi extricates
another load from the kid's panda bear which is now in
shreds.

76 THE OLD MAN 76
helped by Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom
from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.
77 MANNY AND GASPAR 77
break open wooden clothes hangers concealing cocaine as the stockbroker changes clothes.
78 THE MOTHER 78
picks up the baby and removes cocaine from its diaper.
While:
79 THE FORMER NUN 79
in partial habit, steps out of the toilet, adjusting her underpants; she places a package of cocaine on a table, on which we now see approximately five kilos stacked.
80 TONY 80
counting out the cash for his mules, Omar there, overlooking the operation.
81 MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 81
Again. But this time going out.
The nun, now a housewife, going through an exit gate carrying hand luggage.
82 TONY 82
watching, glances up at the electronic information board and the boarding gate--
Houston clocks out the time.-- we move to Los Angeles -- "on time" ---
Tony's eyes moving to the mother, now without the child,
buying her ticket at the counters.
Manny joins him, nodding okay.
Tony, with a glance at his watch, starts out the terminal.
The roar of the aircraft blending with city sounds as we continue the rapid pace of the montage with music.
86 EXT. GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86
Frank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.
87 INT. LAUNDRY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 87
The plush millionaire's restaurant is to be seen again.
Frank has his arm around Tony, introducing him to a business-type. Elvira looks on.
88 INT. HIGH-FASHION STORE - DAY 88
In a high-fashion store, Tony buys a beautiful dress for Gina who is delighted when she sees herself in the mirror, hugs Tony. Manny watches, unable to take his eyes off her.
SALESLADY
(admiringly to Tony)
Your wife looks terrific in that.
TONY
My wife? You gotta be kidding.
89 INT. LOBBY - LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 89
Elvira steps out in a Pucci summer dress, looks around. Tony is waiting for her. She's surprised.
TONY
He got held up at the golf club. He told me to pick you up. He`ll meet us at the race track.
Elvira contemplating him with distaste.
TONY
He said if he was late to get Ice Cream first.
She sighs, walks across the lobby. He follows.
90 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 90
Elvira steps out of the lobby into the driveway.  He points.
TONY
Over there....
She looks. The car is a yellow Cadillac convertible with 2
big fins and Snoopy the dwarf dashboard statue with stickers
all over the fenders. Adding to the impression are Manny
and Chi-Chi waiting in the backseat.
ELVIRA
(registers it with distaste)
That thing? You must be kidding.
TONY
(hurt)
Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.
ELVIRA
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.
TONY
It's got a few years on it but it's 'a creampuff.'
ELVIRA
It looks like somebody's nightmare.
91 INT. LUXURY MOTOR SALES - CORAL GABLES - DAY 91
Camera moves around a slick, red Jaguar -- XG 6 -- with Tony, accompanied by Manny, Chi-Chi, the Salesman. Elvira waits aloofly off to the side.
TONY
(to Elvira)
So you like this better?
ELVIRA
(shrugs)
It's got style.
TONY
Yeah it looks like one of the tigers from India.
MANNY
(to Elvira)
Tony been dragging me around to the zoos, looking at tigers. He wants to buy one of them too.
(amused)
He do that he gonna have no friends left. Not that he got any now.
TONY
You'll like the tiger Manny, you'll see.
ELVIRA
You going to drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat Tony?
TONY
Yeah... maybe some lady tiger.
(to Salesman)
How much?
SALESMAN
Twenty-eight thousand dollars. Fully equipped.
TONY
(genuinely)
That all?
SALESMAN
Machine gun turrets are extra.
TONY
(circling the car)
Funny guy hunh... Manny, c'mere.
Manny comes over and Tony walks him along the car, in
quieter tones.
TONY
Get these sections bullet-proofed... here... here... these windows...
MANNY
Yeah.
TONY
...and a phone with a scrambler.
MANNY
Okay...
TONY
...And one of those radio scanners, y'know, pick out flying saucers and stuff.
MANNY
Yeah, a good one.
ELVIRA
(joining them)
Don't forget the fog lights.
TONY
Yeah, in case I go to the swamps, good idea.
ELVIRA
(impatiently)
I thought you were taking me to Frank?
TONY
(glances at his watch)
We still got an hour. You hungry?
ELVIRA
No, but I'm bored.
TONY
Figgers. Check it out, will you Manny and pay the guy and grab a
taxi out to the track....
Thanks, yeah....
TONY
(before leaving)
Oh yeah.
He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private joke. He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, "Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag."
Elvira wonders about it as he joins her.
TONY
Somebody gotta keep the animals out.
92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92
Tony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.
TONY
I'm glad you came. I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.
ELVIRA
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?
TONY
Yeah -- you know who.
They get in the car.
ELVIRA
And what would Frank say?
She has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then
other, then takes a last hit through the mouth.
TONY
I like Frank.. -but I like you better.
He reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,
staring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He
kisses her. She goes with it.
Pause. She pulls back.
ELVIRA
(same tone of voice as before)
Don't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.
As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.
CUT TO
INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.
On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.
Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.
SOSA
So this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---
OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...
Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.
Tony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.
Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose.
Pause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.
SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.
OMAR
That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.
SOSA
Yes, it would've been nice if he could have come.
TONY
(cutting in)
and he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?
SOSA
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)
So he sent you?
TONY
Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.
Looking over the laboratory like it was his.
Omar glances at him, annoyed.
SOSA
We'll talk at my house. Shall we go...
CUT TO
94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94
The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).
SOSA
(to Omar)
...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.
OMAR
Well, we do that, we gotta take the
risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You
know what that means?
TONY
That means we gotta go to war with
`em.
looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make
Sosa
of this guy.
SOSA
When we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.
TONY
Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.
SOSA
Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.
TONY
13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You
know what that's like these days?
They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.
Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.
SOSA
What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.
Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.
The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.
Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
A beat.
He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.
OMAR
(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)
Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!
Tony shrugs.
SOSA
Where were we?
TONY
Panama. You're looking for a partner, right?
Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.
SOSA
...something like that.
(chuckles)
OMAR
Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...
TONY
Hey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.
OMAR
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!
TONY
(shrugs)
Frank'll love it. Don't worry about it.
OMAR
That's up to Frank -- not you.
He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing
-- also an advantage in the split.
OMAR
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...
SOSA
It's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to
Frank.
OMAR
(a beat)
Okay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.
SOSA
(without hesitation)
Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.
You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.
Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.
OMAR
Yeah. I guess so....
TONY
Great.
SOSA
(glancing at Tony, to Omar)
...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.
OMAR
(doesn't get it)
I don't think that...
TONY
(lighting a cigar)
Hey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...
Sosa laughs. Omar scowls.
CUT TO
95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95
The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:
Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.
The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.
Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.
TONY
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?
SOSA
Why?
TONY
Cause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.
Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.
TONY
(overlapping the joke)
They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.
SOSA
Maybe he'll move to Miami too...
Gabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?
Sosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.
GABRIELLA
(distracted)
Lovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.
SOSA
I'll take care of it myself.
GABRIELLA
(turning to him)
...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.
SOSA
Of course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...
(to Tony)
My fiance, Gabriella Montini.
TONY
Hello....
She nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.
GABRIELLA
It's a pleasure.
She withdraws. Tony watches her go.
TONY
I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.
Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.
SOSA
(focusing the binoculars)
I like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel
the same way about the rest of your organization.
Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.
TONY
In-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?
SOSA
I mean Omar Suarez.
Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.
Sosa passes him the binoculars.
SOSA
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.
From several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....
Tony, astonished, looks up.
96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96
terrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.
SOSA
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.
Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
A silence.

97 TONY 97
shaken, lowers the binoculars.
Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.
Tony looks back at him, contemplative.
Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.
SOSA
So how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?
TONY
(awry, stalks up to him)
Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.
That piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..
For all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!
SOSA
(moves away)
I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this
Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.
TONY
Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.
(then)
You got my word on that.
Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,
makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony
following the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.
SOSA
You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.
Their eyes locked together.

REVERSE WIPE TO
99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99
In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
outside his office.
He jerks his head. Inside. They go.

100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100
The office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,

JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares
incredulously at Tony.
LOPEZ
(livid)
You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars
without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy!
TONY
Hey take it easy Frank, cone.
LOPEZ
Con0 my ass!
TONY
At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank... we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank. Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.
LOPEZ
Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.
TONY
Frank... Frank...
LOPEZ
(ranting)
You know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?
...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.
Cause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?
(pause, eyeing Tony)
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?
TONY
You saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?
Lopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.
LOPEZ
(carefully)
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall
your deal with Sosa.
Long pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.
TONY
(finally)
...have it your way boss.
He turns to leave, nods to Manny.
LOPEZ
Montana... just remember I am the boss.
TONY
Sure you're the boss.
Gets to the door, Manny joining him.
LOPEZ
Y'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.
Tony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.

102 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 102
Tony, impeccable in Cardin whites, and Manny, also slicked
up, are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office.
Behind the desk sits the heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed lawyer,
George Sheffield smoking yet another cigarette, his voice a
hoarse gravelled croak, the eyes -- with their deadpan stare
-- always pausing before they speak. He doesn't get up from
his desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the
Mutiny Club.
SHEFFIELD
What can I do for you Montana?
TONY
(indicates Manny)
My partner. Manny Ray.
Manny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes
briefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.
TONY
So George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.
SHEFFIELD
Did they also tell you how expensive I am?
TONY
Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.
SHEFFIELD
I see you been reading your American history Montana, what've you done lately to earn a place in it?
TONY
(chuckles)
I'm trying to stay outta it, y'know
what I mean? I'm expanding my operation. So I want a class guy like you on the payroll -- advising me. Starting now.
SHEFFIELD
(a longer pause than usual)
Cash. On the table.
...Start with a $100,000.

Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face. She`s
in jeans, barefoot and casual.
ELVIRA
Tony?
TONY
Hi there.
Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
explanation. There is none.
ELVIRA.
ml.. -you just missed Frank.
TONY
I didn't come here to see Frank.
She looks at him amazed. The balls on this guy!
ELVIRA
(cooling to him fast)
This is not the time or the place.
Next time make an appointment first.
She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
bulls in.
TONY
I got something important to tell ya.
Why don't you make some drinks and act normal.
ELVIRA
Sure. Why not? We're all normal here.
She heads for the pool, nonplussed. Tony closes the door, eases slowly across the room towards her, awkwardly trying to make conversation.
TONY
I heard you was in Europe travelling 'round all by yourself. Woman like you shouldn't have to travel alone...
(pause, no response)
I been travelling myself.
ELVIRA
Broadening your intellect. I heard.
TONY
What else d'you hear?
ELVIRA
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.
TONY
Yeah. It makes things easier this way, don't it?
She's puzzled. He drinks a toast.
TONY
Here's to the land of opportunity.
ELVIRA
For you maybe.
She drinks to it.
TONY
Hey, do you like kids?
ELVIRA
Kids? Sure, why not -- as long as there's a nurse.
TONY
Good. Cause I like kids too. I like boys and girls.
She's waiting. He paws the ground, awkward as a bull.
ELVIRA
That's broad of you, Tony. Travelling really helped. Look, Frank's going to be back any moment and when he walks through that....
TONY
Yeah. Yeah -- fuck Frank. Look, here's the story. I'm from the gutter but I climbed out of it. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here in Miami. I could  be like Frank but bigger -- The biggest!
Elvira's looking at him like he's on the moon.
TONY
Anyway what I came up here to tell you is that.. .uh I like you. I think you're terrific. I known this the first time I seen you. You belong to me. We're tigers. The two of us... I want you to marry me and be the mother of my children.
Silence.
ELVIRA
(stunned)
Me? Marry you?
She laughs, a short harsh laugh.
TONY
(sincere)
Yeah... -marry me.
ELVIRA
What about Frank? What are you going to do about Frank?
TONY
Frank's not gonna last...
(puts down the drink, puts his hand on hers)
I'm not looking for an answer right now Elvira, but I want you to think about it, okay? I want you to think hard... I'll see you the next time.
He goes. She stares at him, still dazed, yet deep down -- flattered.
CUT TO
105 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105
The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
refined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out
of his path, he angles through them.
OWNER
(indicating a table)
Over here.
Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.
TONY
What the fuck is she doing here, she's....
(heading towards her)
MANNY
(stops him)
Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake. What do you give her money for if you don't want her to go out, have some fun?
Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves back. Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.
TONY
Who's she with?
MANNY
Some kid, he works for Luco, he's harmless....
Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him. Caucasian,
about 250 pounds.
TONY
Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
don't dance too close.
MANNY
Sure Tony.

I'll be at the table.
LARGE MAN

Hello Tony, you remember me?

TONY

Yeah, sure. You're...

...Bernstein, right. Mel Bernstein.
Narcotics, right?
BERNSTEIN
That's right, Tony.
I think we better talk.
(indicates a quieter area)
There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's cause just the eyes do the smiling.
TONY
Talk about what, what's there to talk about? I ain't killed anybody
lately.
BERNSTEIN
No not lately but we can go back to ancient history.
Like Emilio Rebenga, like a bunch of whacked Indians at
the Sun-Ray Motel in Miami Beach....
TONY
Oh yeah? ...you know Mel, whoever's giving you your information must be taking you guys for a long ride.

TONY
No shit -- how much?
BERNSTEIN
(doodling on a piece of paper)
There's an answer to that too....
He holds the paper up briefly in front of Tony. It says "25,000"
TONY
(reacts)
That's a big number.
BERNSTEIN
That's on a monthly basis. Every month the same thing. You know how this works, don't you? We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me. When we hit, it hurts -- Same thing works the other way. You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.
TONY
S'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?
BERNSTEIN
That's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.
(getting up)
I don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?
...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to
London, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.
Tony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.
BERNSTEIN
I like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.
But you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.
Everyday aboveground's a good day.
He winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.
Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.
Tony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....
107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107
Elvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,
the bodyguard. Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy,
the Owner, and Elvira drifts in.
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her.
She sees him coming, glances in Frank's direction.
Tony comes right up to her.
TONY
Hi...
ELVIRA
Hello, Tony.
Lopez, in conversation with the Owner, glances over, sees
Tony with Elvira, his expression narrows.
TONY
so.. .Did you think about.what I said? About the kids?
ELVIRA
Tony, you're really nuts you know, -- you really are.
Lopez comes over, takes Elvira's arm, and smiles at Tony.
LOPEZ
Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl?
TONY
That's what I'm doing, Frank.
Tense look on Frank's face. The bodyguard circles.
LOPEZ
(without a smile)
Then go do it somewhere else. Get
lost.
ELVIRA
Frank, he was only...
TONY
(ignoring her)
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes,
man.
LOPEZ
You won't be hearing anything, you
go on like this.
TONY
You gonna stop me?
Frank is livid.
LOPEZ
You're fucking right I am. I'm giving you orders.
Blow. (Esfumate)
The bodyguard moves closer to Tony who doesn't move.
Manny suddenly slides into frame, backing Tony.
TONY
(icy)
Orders? There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.
Pause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the
crest. Lopez abruptly turns away.
LOPEZ
(to Elvira)
Let's go!
ELVIRA
Frank, this is ridiculous....
LOPEZ
C'mon!
He crowds her. she goes. Angry, Tony watches as they exit the club.
MANNY
What happened?
TONY
That cocksucker! -- He put that homicide prick Bernstein on me.
They stroll back to the table.
MANNY
What for?
TONY
The Emilio Rebenga hit. Remember that.
MANNY
You're kidding!
TONY
Who else knew about it? Omar's fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me.
MANNY
I don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony. Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York?
TONY
You go. I like the weather here just fine.
He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
stairs to the toilets.
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
after her.
MANNY
Hey, where you going?
He doesn't answer.

He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
the door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
burgundy suit running his hand along her ass.
GINA
(shocked)
Tony!
TONY
What are you doing! What are you doing!
He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
times into the wall.
GINA
(trying to restrain him)
Tony! What're you doing! You're crazy!
He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.
TONY
(to Gina)
What are you doing with this shit, hunh?
(back to burgundy suit)
Get the fuck out of here, maricon, y'hear, I'll kill you next time.
GINA
Fernando!
TONY

Shaddup!
Manny runs in, several others now looking in from the hall.
MANNY
Tony!
Tony shoves burgundy suit out of the stall, past Manny.
TONY
Go on!
GINA
What the hell is....
TONY
You think it's cute somebody puttin' their hands all over your ass, my kid sister, hunh? In a toilet!
GINA
It's none of your business!
TONY
The fuck it isn't! Three dollar hooker, that's what you are.
Snorting shit like that at your age, you oughta ---
GINA
What are you -- a priest? A cop! Look at your life. You can't tell
me what to do!
TONY
I'm telling ya! I don't wanna see you in here again. I catch you in here I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.
GINA
Oh yeah! Go ahead!
TONY
You're getting outta here right now!
Don't push me baby, don't push me!
GINA
Don't fucking push me!
MANNY
Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air...
The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
the hallway. Several more people are watching.
GINA
You got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!
Tony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.
Tony stands there, abated.
The crowd is silent.
Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.
MANNY
(tender)
Come on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.
(strokes her face)
TONY
(disturbed, to Manny)
Get her home, get her outta here!
He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
no regrets, but disturbed.
Manny helps Gina to her feet.
MANNY
Come on, pussycat, I'll buy you a
cup of coffee.
CUT TO
110 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 110
Tony, isolated and edgy, reenters the main room, circling
the edges of the crowd, up to the bar.
TONY
(to the bartenderess, pointing)
Gimme a double of that!
He turns, catches a last glimpse of Gina leaving with Manny.
CUT TO
111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111
Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
coupe. She's still angry.
GINA
...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
Mama's right. She says he hurts everything he touches.
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
again. Never!
MANNY
He loves you, what do you want. He
feels he raised you.
GINA
He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!
MANNY
Hey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...
GINA
Against what?
MANNY
'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.
He says it like it's personal.
GINA
(picks up on it)
I like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.
MANNY
(a face)
What future's he got? On a bandstand somewhere? He's a bum, Why don't you go out with somebody who's
going somewhere?
She gives him a look.
GINA
Like who?
MANNY
Like a doctor or a dentist or something.
GINA
What about you? Why don't you take me out?
She's looking straight at him now, challenging.
MANNY
What? Me?
GINA
Yeah, you. I see the way you look at me -- Manolo Ribera.
MANNY
(nervous)
Hey, Tony's like my brother.. You're his kid sister, okay?
GINA
So what?
MANNY
So....
GINA
(taunting)
You afraid of Tony? You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
MANNY
Fuck no....
112 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112
Pulls the car over to the curb.
MANNY
I guess we're here.
Pause.
GINA
You think about it, okay, you think about it real hard, Manny. Cause you don't know what you're missing....
She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.
She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.
CUT BACK TO
113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113
The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's "Strangers In The Night'.
OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?
Now I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !
Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.
He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.
Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...
...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors...
Screams, crowd diving for cover...
Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of
his ankle, firing...
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...
Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.
Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.
The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.
CUT TO
114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114
Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.
Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.
CUT TO
115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115
Tony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
it, doesn't express a reaction.
DOCTOR
It's going to be sore for a few months.
TONY
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer...
(to Chi-Chi)
Find out where Lopez is....
CUT TO
116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116
Miriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with "Cocaine" written on it.
TONY'S VOICE
Miriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?
MIRIAM
Yeah... It's Tony.
Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror, takes the phone, in good spirits.
MANNY
Tony cabrone, whatcha doing -- checking up on me, too?
117 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT INT. 117
TONY
Look, get your fuckin' clothes on and meet me outside Lopez's office in forty-five minutes. That phonebooth on 9th. Yeah.
Move your ass!
118 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 118
MANNY

119 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
TONY (v.o.)

Tony hangs up.
120 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 120
MANNY
(grabs his pants)
I gotta go.
MIRIAM
This is worse than fucking a grasshopper, man.
MANNY
Hey, I'm better looking.
(hits the coke again)
Don't do it all, I'll be back later.
CUT TO
121 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:
Tony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.
TONY
(to Nick)
Nick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?
NICK
Yeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.
TONY
All you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'
NICK
Yeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...
CUT TO
122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122
Waldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny
and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.
LOPEZ'S VOICE
...you're kidding! Three to two?
Son of a bitch!...
(cradling the phone)
Guess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!
MUFFLED VOICE
Congratulations. That's great Frank.
Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
with guns casually drawn.
123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123
TONY
Yeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?
Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
there and then, but manages to recover.
LOPEZ
Tony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.
Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
other side of the room.
LOPEZ
Tony... what happened to you, hunh?
TONY
Yeah, lookit. They spoiled one of
my $800 suits.
LOPEZ
Jesus! Who?
in his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.
TONY
Hitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.
Never seen 'em before...Hiya
ii:;. Is there an answer to this too?
BERNSTEIN
(uneasy)
Always is Montana, always is...
LOPEZ
Jesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.
TONY
Hey, you might be right.
LOPEZ
Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.
TONY
(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)
Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.
Pause.
LOPEZ
(awkward)
Well... What are the guns for Tony?
TONY
(shrugs)
What for? I'm paranoid I guess.
The phone rings.
Lopez lets the phone ring.
TONY
Why don't you answer it Frank?
LOPEZ
Must be Elvira. You know women.
After we left that joint she....
The phone rings again.
TONY
(reaches for it)
I'll tell her you're not here.
LOPEZ
(grabs the phone first)
Wait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...
(anxious)
Yeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.
He hangs up. Pause.
TONY
Frank, you're a piece of shit.
LOPEZ
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony?
Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.
TONY
You know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!
LOPEZ
Tony, no! Lissen!
TONY
You remember what a 'haza' is Frank?
It's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.
LOPEZ
(nervous)
Why would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !
TONY
Yeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the
side but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!
He squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.
LOPEZ
Mel! Mel! Do something, please!
Mel sits there impassively.
MEL
It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.
LOPEZ
Please Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll
give you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay! I'll go away Tony, I disappear, you'll never
see me again. Just gimme a chance, gimme a second chance Tony, please... please!
He sobs pathetically.
LOPEZ
I don't wanna die Tony, I never did nothing to nobody Tony! I never hurt nobody!
TONY
Yeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.
He turns to Manny.
TONY
Manny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?
Tony steps aside.
LOPEZ
No! No! Tony!
Manny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.
Lopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in
his bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.
TONY
...Every dog has his day.
He fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.
BERNSTEIN
(remaining calmly in his chair)
I told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.
TONY
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.
His eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.
BERNSTEIN
Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.
TONY
I'm not Mel. You are.
He produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his
left hand pointed at the big man.
BERNSTEIN
(rising from his chair)
Hey, c'mon, what is this?
You can't shoot a cop, Tony.
TONY
Whoever said you were one?
He fires.
Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.
BERNSTEIN
I... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...
TONY
Sure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.
He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is
no longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.
MANNY
(indicates bodyguard)
What about him?
Tony notices.
The bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.
TONY
You want a job Ernie?
ERNIE
Sure, Tony.
TONY
Come see me tomorrow.
ERNIE
Thanks, Tony.
Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.
MANNY
(Offscreen)
Okay, torch it!
CUT TO
124 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - THAT NIGHT 124
Elvira lies in her silk sheets. The doorbell rings. She
gets up.
In a nightgown, she opens the front door.
ELVIRA
Tony?
Tony, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling, moves past her into the apartment.
ELVIRA
What's happened?
Tony just stands there.
ELVIRA
Where's Frank?
TONY
Where do you think? ...Why don't you go pack your stuff. We're going home.
Pause. She understands, moves quietly past him towards the
bedroom.
Tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace,
breathing in the air. The lights of Miami wink at his feet...
. . . the camera moving to one sign down there that says it
all, flashing its big neon bracelet ---

In an exclusive area of Coral Gables, surrounded by walls,
security gates, acres of lawns and a guarded boat dock on a
canal. Tony has erected his fortress-like Shangri-La, to
which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
sign on the front lawn that says:
THE WORLD IS YOURS
MONTANA TRAVEL CO.
Just like it should be.
. . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely short dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina, her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her, evenly and openly as....
Tony and Elvira kiss.
151 EXT. TONY'S GROUNDS - SAME DAY 15
Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira, nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.

CUT TO
151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B
Tony, accompanied by Manny, walks a young, thirtyish bank
president into his office, which is rigged with video monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.
There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs -- but not one sign of a book on the walls.
Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who never stops thinking money.
TONY
...yeah, well, I can't pay that no more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money. So I think it's time you bank boys come down a bit, y'know, like....
BANKER
Hey, Tony, c'mon, that's crazy, I can't do...
TONY
That's too bad, cause....
BANKER
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation here, we're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give us the harder it is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.
TONY
You gonna what, Jerry?
BANKER
Tony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.
TONY
Ten points!
we go someplace else.
Hey, Tony,
BANKER
Tony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it. You're not gonna find a better deal.
TONY
Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the Bahamas myself.
BANKER
You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a regular basis? Once maybe. And then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with twenty million of your hard-earned dollars? C'mon Tony, don't be a schmuck -- who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.
Tony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting
he has another engagement,
BANKER
Stay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.
See you. Take care.
Going.
Tony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:
TONY
That prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's
come over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....
So why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.
TONY
I don't know. Mob guys -- guineas -- I don't trust 'em.
On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker, leaving. Now beginning to see things through the glass darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually -- passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.
TONY
(eyes wandering across to another video monitor)
You get the house sweeped this month? The cars?
MANNY
Yeah, sure, I told you that. Five thousand it set us back.
TONY
See that cable truck there?
152 INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - VIDEO MONITORS 152
Tony's eyes fixing on the cable TV truck parked across the
street.
A man is hauling cable.
There are other private gates visible. The area is lush with gardens, Spanish moss, cypresses and quietly respectable million dollar houses with their Spanish tile roofs and balconies.
MANNY
Yeah?
TONY
Hey Manny when does it take three
days to rig a cable, hunh?
MANNY
Cops.
TONY
What if it's the Diaz brothers? What if they're gonna come and get me?
MANNY
I'll check it out.
TONY
You check it out, then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Bogota.
MANNY
The truck could be anything. We're not the only dopers living on the block y'know.
TONY
Hey you got some attitude y'know Manny -- for a guy in charge of my security.
Hey I'll check it out. I'm just telling you we're spending too much
on this counter-surveillance shit. Twelve percent y'know, of our adjusted gross -- that's not pocket money.
TONY
You worry about it, it lets me sleep
good at night. There's that fat guy
again.
Manny looks over at a jogger running by the gate -- of the
porcine quality, civilian-looking, fifties.
TONY
I seen him every day. 'Bout a week now.
MANNY
So the guy jogs around the neighborhood. He's some fat accountant.
TONY
How the fuck do you know what he is?
MANNY
Hey if he's a cop, don't you think running in circles around a house is a pretty dumb way to watch it?
TONY
Maybe not...
(walks away, stops, looks back)
I'm telling you we're getting sloppy -- our thinking -- our attitude.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!

TELEVISION COMMERCIAL
A television spot for Florida Security Trust (or Miami Security Trust or Dade Security Trust depending on legal options). A respectable business-type walks along the sidewalk with a renascent downtown Miami as a backdrop. Skyscrapers, glinting glass, cranes....
BANK SPOKESMAN
Here at Florida Security Trust we've
been putting your money to work for a
better America. We've been around for seventy-five years. We'll be here tomorrow.
A logo for the firm over with the reminder "Since 1907."
Camera pulling back to reveal Tony watching in his huge gold-
leaf bathtub, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looks
like a character in a Futzie Nutzie loafing cartoon, with his
TV hooked to one side of the tub, a long phone line to the
other, and a radio and portable bar all within reach.
TONY
(to the TV)
Yeah that's cause for seventy-five years you been fucking all of us over, that's why.
(to Manny)
Somebody oughta do something about these whores. Charging me ten points on my money and they're getting away with it! There's no laws anymore,anything goes.
Listen, these guys been here for a thousand years. They got all the angles figured.
Manny straddles a chair next to the tub watching the m
news that was interrupted by the Florida Security Trust
commerical. Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself
up in front of a giant mirror. It's some bathroom --
gigantic with a chandelier hanging in the middle of it,
Italian marble, plants, skylights, rugs, etc....
TONY
You know what capitalism is --
Getting fucked.
ELVIRA
A true capitalist if ever I met one.
She's doing a toot of coke off a flat mirror.

How would you know, bubblehead? You ever do nothing 'sides get your hair fixed and powder your nose? You do too much of that shit anyway.
ELVIRA
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that Tony.
TONY
Know what? Why do you always got to talk like that?
MANNY
(changing the subject)
So I had a pow-wow with this guy
Seidelbaum today. He checks out.
I  got another meet set up.
TONY
When?
MANNY
Thursday ten o'clock. I thought I'd take Chi-Chi with me. Do a million and some change. Get my- feet wet with this guy.
TONY
That's a lot of wet. I'm not Rockefeller. Not yet.
Tony points to a figure on the TV.
TONY
Hey, listen to this, guy's always good for a laugh.
Visual of silver-haired television Anchorman -- Vic Phillips -- with a bit of show business image in him -- to be seen again. Underneath his face, it says "Editorial."
NEWS ANCHORMAN
...the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated $100 billion a year business? It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them. These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element...
(pause for effect)
I am not one of those voices.
TONY
(responding)
What do you know -- you never been right in your life, Vic baby...
(to Manny)
Guy never fuckin' tells the truth.
It's the guys like him, the bankers and the politicians who want to keep the coke illegal so's they can make more money and get the votes to fight the bad guys. They're the bad guys.
They'll fuck anything for a buck....
ELVIRA
And what about you Tony? Can't you stop talking about it all the time, can't you stop saying fuck? -- it's boring, it's boring!
TONY
What's boring?
ELVIRA
You're boring. Money, money, money!
That's all I hear in this house. Frank never talked about money.
TONY
Cause Frank was dumb.
ELVIRA
You know what you've become Tony -- an arriviste, an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking about how much money he's got or how he's getting fucked. Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.
TONY
What're you talking about, I worked my ass off for all this.
(indicates the bathroom)
ELVIRA
(starts out)
It's too bad. Somebody should've given it to you. You would've been a nicer person.
TONY
Hey you know what your problem is pussycat....
ELVIRA
(at the lip of the bathroom)
What is my problem, Tony?
TONY '.
...you got nothing to do with your life that's what.
MANNY
Tony, c'mon....
TONY
Why don't you get a job y'know? Be a nurse, work with blind kids, lepers, open a stationary store, I don't give a shit. Anything beats lying around waiting for me to fuck you all the time.
ELVIRA
(stung)
Don't toot your horn honey, you're not that good.
TONY
Frank was better?
ELVIRA
(guietly)
You're an asshole.
She goes.
TONY
(calling after her, guilty)
Hey c'mon Elvie, whatta we fight for, this is dumb!
He splashes the water in his tub and slams the TV shut.
MANNY
(watching)
I guess married life's not all that it's cracked up to be, hunh, Chico?
A friendly smile but Tony just stares glumly after Elvira.
MANNY
(rises)
I gotta hot date....
TONY
(glaring into his bathwater)
This Seidelbaum thing?
Yeah?
TONY
Me and Nick'11 take care of it. You
stay out of it.
MANNY
(very surprised)
Why! It's my deal.
TONY
You stink as a negotiator, that's why. You like the ladies more'n you do the money -- that's your problem Manny.
MANNY
Hey wait a second, I'm your partner
Tony, you can't trust me, who the
fuck can you trust?.
Pause. Tony mumbles something, barely heard.
TONY
Junior partner.
MANNY
(catching)
Junior partner my ass!
TONY
I'm in charge. Do as I say. You go to Atlanta, you handle the Gomez
delivery there.
MANNY
(a beat)
You oughta lissen to your wife, muchacho. You are an asshole.
He leaves, pissed, Tony mumbling to himself in his bath.
TONY
(to himself)
Fuck you too... what do you know, who the hell put things together... me!
Who do I trust -- me, that's who....
DISSOLVE TO
159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
"CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.
160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160
The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
moving, talking.
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
look the part.
It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.
At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.
LUIS
. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
I was in that picture down in Columbia.
Burn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.
We're good friends. I was his driver...
NICK
(stacking)
Oh yeah?
LUIS
Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.
(pause)
Yeah, I also know Paul Newman. I worked with him in Tucson.
NICK THE PIG
That so? Say, you know Benny
Alvarez there?
LUIS
Uh...
SEIDELBAUM
(interrupting to Tony)
Now you want a company check here for $283,107.65?
TONY
(pause, checking his fingers)
Uh... I come up with 284.6
SEIDELBAUM
(pauses, looks again at his figures)
No, that's just not possible. The
machine don't make mistakes.
TONY
Well, we'll count it again.
SIEDELBAUM
Oh Jesus!
TONY
Hey business is business. We're talking $1500.
SEIDELBAUM
(exasperated)
Okay, you keep the change okay, I don't give a shit.
TONY
Okay but I'll go through it again with you.
Seidelbaum ignores it, counting up another stack.
SEIDELBAUM
Okay... This check now, this one goes to the...
TONY
Montana Realty Company.
NICK
(to Luis)
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?
DISSOLVE TO
161 INT. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY
They're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke
filling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest
of green and they're still counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their eyes.
SEIDELBAUM
We're up to what?
LUIS
(consulting his notes)
Seven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.
TONY
(grins)
Hey we're almost finished. Another 200 thousand and we can take a leak.
SIEDELBAUM
Yeah, but this'll do fine.
Pulls a pistol from his ankle and rises.
SEIDELBAUM
You're under federal arrest, Montana,
for a continuing criminal conspiracy.
The RICO Statute. Get 'em up.
Tony astonished.
TONY
Oh shit... You're not kidding hunh?
Eyes darting. Considering the options. The little fat man's eyes are suddenly agile and mean-.-Tony reads them, lifts his arms.
SEIDELBAUM
(to Luis)
Get it.
Luis moves around Tony to disarm him.
TONY
So how do I know you guys are cops?
Luis, produces a wallet with identification, shoves it under Tony's nose.
LUIS
What's that say, asshole?
Insert: Photograph and Drug Enforcement Agency ID.
TONY
(impressed)
Hey that's good work, where can I get one of those?
LUIS
Cabron! You call yourself Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up.
SEIDELBAUM
Looie! Cool it.
TONY
(unfazed; wiping the sweat off)
Call your dog off, Seidelbaum. I wanna call my lawyer.
SEIDELBAUM
Lotta good he's gonna do you Montana. There's an eye there in the wall.
(points)
Say hi, honey....
162 IN'P. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY - REVERSE ANGLE ON VIDEOTAPE
Blurry image of the men in the room. Tony is not that
clear an image as he glances briefly, uninterested, into the camera.
TONY
Yeah, is that what you jerk off in front of Seidelbaum?
NICK
Oh shit and I was supposed to meet this chick at three. What a pain in the ass.
SEIDELBAUM
(to camera)
Okay, Danny, turn it off.
The angle goes black.
163 BACK TO SCENE 163
SEIDELBAUM
(reciting the Miranda)
All right, Montana, you have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can be taken against you. You have the....
TONY
(cuts him off)
I know all that shit, Seidelbaum, save your breath. It ain't gonna
stick. You know it, I know it. I'm here changing dollar bills is all.
So you wanna waste everybody's time here, I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami. He's so good tomorrow morning you're gonna be working in Alaska, Seidelbaum....
As they handcuff him....

CUT TO
165 XNT. TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 165
Tony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts his
hair. A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,
goes out. It's the first time we sense he might be using
the stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.
CUT TO
166 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Tony is pacing nervously. Manny looks on. Red-headed
Sheffield rasps through a cloud of cigarette smoke behind
his desk.
SHEFFIELD
. ..you give me a check for a hundred grand plus three hundred in cash and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge. But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion -- and they'll get it.
TONY
What am I looking at?
SHEFFIELD
Five years, you'll be out in three, maybe less if I can make a deal.
TONY
For what! Three years in the can!
For washing money? This whole country's built out of washed money!
MANNY
Hey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.
Tony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an
epileptic fit.
SHEFFIELD
I'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.
TONY
No...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?
SHEFFIELD
Tony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.
Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
Sheffield's desk.
TONY
All right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell
you about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?
I'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.
Pause.
SHEFFIELD
(cool)
The point is made. Now where's the money?
Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
desk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
hands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.
CUT TO
167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167
Camera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside
gallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with
several other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their
coffee after lunch.
SOSA
(rising)
Tony...Tony.
TONY
Alex.
They hug like they were the closest of friends.
SOSA
I'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?
TONY
She's okay. How's your wife?
SOSA
Three more months.
TONY
That's great.
SOSA
And you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.
TONY
(sore point)
I'm working on it.
SOSA
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.
They laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with
him than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.
SOSA
Tony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.
He smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.
SOSA
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.
PEDRO QUINN
A pleasure, Mr. Montana.
Camera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music
assuming a faint martial stride.
SOSA
General Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.
The man is in civilian clothes.
SOSA
Ariel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.
The cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who
nailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-
type in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.
SOSA
Charles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.
TONY
Hi....
GOODSON
How do you do, Mr. Montana...
He smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.
SOSA
Nicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.
The black aide goes.
SOSA
(solicitous)
Tony, come, please sit here.
Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
surrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the
proceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.
He suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
moving with another woman past a window of the house. Then
she's gone.
Sosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching
knees.
SOSA
Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....
TONY
Sure, Alex.
SOSA
Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.
Tony waits.
SOSA
We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....
Pause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
gaze away.
TONY
And your problem, Alex?
Sosa looks around, stands up.
SOSA
Come, I'll show you.
Tony cautiously stands to follow him.
CUT TO
168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168
MATOS STUDY
A "Phil Donahue-type" setting. A segment now in progress
with the "Donahue-type" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.
Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion.
GUTIERREZ
More than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It
sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!
INTERVIEWER
I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.
GUTIERREZ
The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,
Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.
INTERVIEWER
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?
GUTIERREZ
(laughs)
Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --
Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV
screen, dour, ruthless.
GUTIERREZ
. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?
Laughter.
169 TONY 169
watching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from
the coke usage.
SOSA
A Communist -- financed by Moscow.
170 GUTIERREZ 170
holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the
TV screen.
GUTIERREZ
...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....
INTERVIEWER
What are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?
GUTIERREZ
(passionate)
The United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.
171 TONY 171
staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.
GUTIERREZ
You Americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....
Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.
SOSA
...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...
That's our problem.
TONY
Yeah.
Sosa looks up.
The Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into
the room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over
Tony. The Skull leads him in.
SOSA
You've met Alberto before?...
TONY
(remains seated)
Sure. How could I forget?
SOSA
Alberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.
Alberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.
SOSA
(to Tony)
So you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...
(*en)
Is that a problem, Tony?
Tony looks around the faces, then:
TONY
That's no problem, Alex....
Alex nods, pleased.
Hold on Tony. He blows his nose again.
CUT TO
175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT
A millionaire's place, like "The Forge" on Arthur Godfrey
Road. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.
TONY
Hey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.
Vic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--
cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a
patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.
VIC
Oh, is that so?
TONY
Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?
VIC
Aren't you... Tony Montana?
TONY
(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)
Yeah, that's me.
The half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.
TONY
(waves to them)
Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.
Waves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.
MANNY
(reproving)
Hey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....
TONY
I don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!
Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
of an anguish he does not understand.
CUT TO
173 TONY
sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....
MANNY
So what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?
TONY
Lot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.
The whole world's turning into politics.
He pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.
MANNY
The one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.
TONY
Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?
Manny remembers.
TONY
No free rides in this world, kid.
MANNY
So who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?
ELVIRA
What guy?
TONY
(to Manny)
You stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.
He takes a hit, unnoticed.
ELVIRA
(unheard)
What guy?
MANNY
(to Tony)
I don't like it.
TONY
You don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!
What's Seidelbaum got to do with this?
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
Elvira's untouched plate.
TONY
Why don't you eat your food, what's
wrong with it?
ELVIRA
I'm not hungry.
She quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-
ment of her hand.
TONY
So what'd you order it for?
ELVIRA
I lost my appetite.
She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.
MANNY
(trying to shift the mood)
So what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....
Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.
TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
Is that what it's all about?
MANNY
It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....
TONY
(doesn't hear)
. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?
(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)
A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!
MANNY
(gently)
Tony, you're drunk.
TONY
...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it
man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!
Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.
ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!
They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.
ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!
The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.
Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.
TONY
Sit down before I kill you.
ELVIRA
. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons
around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?
(in a softer tone)
Oh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...
Silence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's
this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
their lines.
TONY
(softly)
Go on, get a cab home, you're stoned.
(to Manny)
Manny.
ELVIRA
No, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't
even know it.
TONY
All right I'm stoned.
MANNY
(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)
Come on, baby.
ELVIRA
No, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...
(staring at Tony)
I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.
Pause. She starts wobbling out.
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.
TONY
Let her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.
Stumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.
Tony's eyes follow her. Pause.
The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
food, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food
and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.
TONY
You're all assholes. You know why?
Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.
He wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony
shakes him loose.
TONY
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.
He starts out, staggers.
TONY
So say good night to the bad guy...
You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.
He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
and delight.
CUT TO
174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT
A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
moves into frame.
Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
under the car.
Tony looks:
175 ERNIE
down the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying
traffic, signals okay.
176 CHI-CHI
waits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.
Tony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
snort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
under.
Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
axle of the car.

sees it.
A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
towards us.
Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
Tony hurries to the car, bends down.
TONY
(Spanish)
Psst! La Jara! Apaga.
The Shadow douses it and freezes in position.
Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.
Tony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.
TONY
Hey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?
Jesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.
FEMALE COP
Why don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....
TONY
The ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?
FEMALE COP
(in a hurry)
Look it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.
(signal to her partner, they drive off)
Tony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to
the car, bangs on the hood several times.
TONY
Hey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!
178 CONTINUED 178
Pause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.
gun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's
a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.
SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck you doing!
TONY
(winks)
Hey that was close, hunh?
CUT TO
179 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - DAY - EARLY NEXT MORNING 179
Ernie, Chi-Chi, and the Shadow huddle cold and uncomfortable in the sedan, waiting -- eating pizzas and drinking beers. The morning has come down ice cold.
180 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK - DAY 180
At the phone booth up corner, Tony -- the unshaven, bleary-eyed -- is rapping on the phone.
TONY
. . . Yeah, _ yeah...nah, nah...you tell Sheffield keep his nose out of it, there's not gonna be no trial, I got everything under control, yeah... Have you heard from Elvira?
He waits, hangs up, snorts some more, impatient. He picks up the phone again, starts dialing.
181 INT. TONY'S NEW YORK SEDAN - DAY 18:
In the sedan, the Shadow peers over, angry, at Tony.
SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck's he doing now! That sonufabitch....
182 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK r DAY 18;
In the booth, Tony, snorting another nostril, moves back
and forth as the phone rings at the other end. Finally she
picks up.
ELVIRA'S VOICE
Yes?
TONY
Hello baby, how's Baltimore?..hey look Elvie, I been thinkin' 'bout us, you know and....
The phone goes dead. Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.
183 OMITTED 183
184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184
He gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him
with the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back. Tony, seemingly unaffected by the weather, reaches for an open pint of ice cream, starts eating it with a plastic spoon.
He alternates ice cream with coke through the scene;the
dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half-eaten
Chinese food.
The Shadow, disgusted with all this mess, restrains himself,
staring out at the street with a hate-filled expression,
saying nothing.
CHI-CHI
(concerned)
Everything okay Tony?
TONY
Yeah roses. Where is this fuckin' guy?
I don't got all day to piss away.
CHI-CHI
Probably fucking his wife.
(eating pizza)
Jeezus it's cold.
185 THEIR POINT OF VIEW THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
The door of the brownstone. No movement. Though now
there's increasing traffic on the street and passing pedestrians.
TONY
. . . we oughta shoot him when he comes
out the door, save a lotta bullshit.
186 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
CHI -CHI
What's so important about this guy anyway? What's he, a Communist?
TONY
(snorting through his mouth)
Nah he's no Communist. He's a kinda symbol, that's what he is.
CHI-CHI
What the fuck's that mean -- symbol?
TONY
It's like when you die, your life meant something to somebody, y'know? It wasn't like you just lived it for yourself, but you did something for the rest of the human race too...
Tony snorts another line -- seen through the rearview mirror.
CHI-CHI
(nods his head somberly)
Yeah?
TONY
Me, I wanna die fast. With my name written in lights all over the sky. Tony Montana. He died doin' it.
CHI-CHI
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony, you ain't gonna die.
TONY
(doesn't hear him)
...So I'll end up in a coffin. So what? The cockroach fires the bullet's gonna end up in a coffin just like me. But I lived better when I was here. And that's what counts.
Pause.
TONY
(nervous, to Ernie)
Ernie, what time?
ERNIE
Ten to.
TONY
(opening his door)
I gotta call Manny.
He starts out the door. The Shadow barks out something in
preemptory Spanish.
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Sit down!
TONY
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, you,...
CHI-CHI
Tony, he's coming!

Matos sits there warming up his car, looking back at the brownstone.
191 XNT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
SHADOW
(Spanish, excited)
...The UN -- right in front of it.
In the daylight. That's the way they want it.
Tony breaks open a fresh vial.
TONY
(English)
Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like.
The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who
doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.
SHADOW
(Spanish; to Chi-Chi)
What's he saying! You tell him stay inside thirty metres of the car okay -- no more you just stay inside thirty metres.
TONY
(English)
Hey, okay, I heard you the the first time. One time okay. Just tell me one time.
(snorts)
SHADOW
(Spanish)
I tell you thirty metres okay! You understand, madre de dios, why this hop-head is driving!
CHI-CHI
Okay, okay.
TONY
(English)
Okay, okay, cool it willya, all right.
192 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos pulls his car out of the parking space.
Tony puts his car in gear, prepares to pull out when:

194 MATOS' BROWNSTONE - SIDEWALK - DAY
The wife opens the door, steps out -- followed, moments
later, by two schoolchildren, books in hand. Matos waves
to them to come along.
195 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony looks astonished, back at Chi-Chi.
TONY
What the fuck! You said the wife took `em in the other car.
CHI-CHI
She did boss. She did it every fuckin' day, I swear!

The two children are now climbing in the back of Matos'
sedan, the wife getting into the pasenger seat. They drive off.
197 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 19:
Tony, upset now, goes to his vial, snorts, turns sharply to
the Shadow.
TONY
Hey Chico, no fuckin' way! No wife, no kids! We hit this fuckin' guy we hit him alone okay.
SHADOW
(Spanish)
No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now.
We do it.
He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos,
muttering to himself.
TONY
...aw fuck this, this fuckin' asshole!
Chi-Chi, in the back, looks on worried.
198 NEW YORK STREETS - DAY - FOLLOWING MATOS' SEDAN
through Manahattan, towards the UN.
The Shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder. He now sticks a key in it. A red light pulses at intervals.
Tony, driving, glances, the tension building in him, he
does another giant snort.
Matos' sedan, swerving out into traffic to pass a car, has
a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.
The Shadow goes nuts, peering over the dashboard to see if
the bomb came loose.
SHADOW
(to himself, Spanish)
Madre de dios, my bomb! -- don't you fuckin' fall, my little baby!
Perspiration starting to break out on his forehead.
Tony also feels the sweat coming on.
TONY
(muttering)
...this is fuckin' crazy, man, this is sloppy doing it this way, you
don't do it like this....
He honks furiously at a cab that tries to cut him off.
199 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony, intense at the wheel, sneezing, his nose running.
SHADOW
(equally tense, in Spanish)
You're losing them! There! That street, they go that street!
TONY
I see 'im! I see `im!
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Thirty metres! Thirty metres! Go! Go!
TONY
Shut the fuck up!
Honking like a madman and accelerating past a truck....
TONY

sedan pulling off at 47th and Second Avenue heading
Mato's

end of the street.
201 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 20:
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Okay, now...now. Right here.
Easy. Easy!
The decoder.
Tony snorts.
TONY
(muttering)
Aw, fuck you, you fuckin' vulture....
The Shadow in stark profile.
His finger depresses the first key of the decoder.

of the United Nations.
204 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 204
The Shadow is in a full sweat.
SHADOW
(Spanish)
...okay, okay, nice 'n' easy...at the corner... when he pulls up at the corner.
His finger hovering around the second key of the decoder.
Chi-Chi in the back, leaning forward across the seat.
TONY

Gutierrez' sedan inches its way out of the traffic and eases along the curb.
207 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 207
Tony honking his way through traffic after them, building
to a climax with himself.
TONY
(muttering)
...bunch of fuckin' vultures. You don't have the guts to look 'im in the eye when you kill him, you gotta hide, you fuckin' vulture.
Honk, honk.
SHADOW
Shut up!
CHI-CHI
(suddenly panicked)
He's gonna get out! Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!
TONY
(ignoring all the commotion)
makes you feel good, hunh?
Killing the wife and the kids. Big man. Well fuck you! What do you
think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman. Well fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life.
His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Beretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, leveling it on the Shadow.
TONY
Motherfucker!
The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps
two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.
CHI-CHI
Oh Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the....
Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic
around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as
the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday
morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered
up against a passenger window and nobody really sees...
except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she
wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.
TONY
(continuing to mutter)
...so what'd you think I was, hunh?
A fucking worm like you! I told you don't fuck with me! I told you no kids! You shoulda listened to me you stupid fuck!

Planes roaring.
210 INT. JFK AIRPORT
Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
on them.
TONY
Ernie? Where the fuck you been?
ERNIE'S VOICE
I had a delivery. Tony, everything go okay, whatsa ---
TONY
Fuck no? Where the hell's Manny? I been calling all over.
ERNIE'S VOICE.
I don't know, Tony. He's been gone last couple of days. Didn't say nothing.
TONY
What! Where! I left that sunufabitch in charge! What the hell is going on here, can't I trust anybody anymore.
ERNIE'S VOICE
I don't know, Tony, he just took off, y'know, he didn't say nothing...
you all right?
TONY
No, I'm not all right. I'm pissed off! And when I 'get there I'm gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin' place!
ERNIE'S VOICE
When you coming back, Tony?
TONY
Tonight!
(repeating to himself)
Where the hell is that cocksucker?
I can't trust nobody no more. You think just cause I'm a nice guy....
ERNIE'S VOICE
Uh, Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone. She got to see you right away.
TONY
Gina's gone? Where! Oh fuck! ...Tell her I'll be there tonight. Okay?
ERNIE'S VOICE
Right.
TONY
(about to hang up, pauses)
uh -- how 'bout Elvie -- did she call?
ERNIE'S VOICE
(a beat)
No.
TONY
Yeah, okay, okay... listen if she calls, tell her I love her, okay?
ERNIE'S VOICE
Yeah, okay Tony.
Tony hangs up. A moment of despair. Then he snorts
another spoon and snaps back.

Tony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained clothes, rushes in.
213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213
Ernie meets them at the door.
TONY
Hear from Manny?
ERNIE
No Tony. Your mama called again.
She gotta see you. And Sosa's been ringing every half-hour on the eleven line. Tony, he sounds pissed, he....
TONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Chi-Chi, get him on the line. In the office.
Chi-Chi goes.
TONY
What about Elvie -- anything?
Ernie shakes his head.
TONY
You keep trying Manny. I need that cocksucker, you hear, I need him here! Okay?
ERNIE
Right, Tony.
Tony stalks off, towards his office.
214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE
Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
and stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.
TONY
Yeah? Hi. Mami.
Her voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.
The other phone is ringing.
Not really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.
Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.
TONY
(into the phone)
Yeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!
No problem, okay.
He hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.
The telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.
TONY
. . . so whaddaya say Alex?
Pause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very
cold.
SOSA'S VOICE
So what happened Tony?
TONY
(casual)
Oh we had some problems.
SOSA'S VOICE
Yeah, I heard.
TONY
How'd you hear?
SOSA'S VOICE
Cause our friend gave a speech today at the UN. He wasn't supposed to give that speech.
TONY
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, your guy Alberto was apiece of shit, he didn't do what I
said so I cancelled his fuckin' contract.
Pause at the other end.
SOSA'S VOICE
e . . M-y partners and I are pissed off.
TONY
Hey Alex, no big deal. There's plenty other 'Albertos'. So I'll
deliver the goods next month.
SOSA'S VOICE
(suddenly angry and letting Tony know)
No! We can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony. And our friend's got security now up the ass. And the heat's coming down hard on me and my partners.
There's not gonna be a next time. You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!
TONY
Hey, you don't talk to me like that!
Who do you ---
SQSA' S VOICE

Tony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.
TONY
Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think
I am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re

The bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi
getting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.
TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
You try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.
He hurries towards the house.
217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:
Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
previously, as if overwhelmed by events.
MAMA
. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.
TONY
The Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?
You ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....
TONY
I never gave her that kinda money.
MAMA
Yes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...
TONY
Mama, was there a guy with hex?
MAMA
I don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....
Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
by the shoulders.
TONY
Where's this house, tell me!
MAMA
Citrus Drive. Four hundred something.
Four hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
Exactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.
He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.
MAMA
Don't you see what you do to her?
Don't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....
TONY
(shakes himself loose, turns on her)
No! You know why she left, Mama?
Not cause of me. Cause of you.
MAMA
Me?
TONY
Yeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.
MAMA
(interrupts)
Nagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?
TONY
(continuing)
...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --
never good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!
MAMA
(interrupts)
. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....
TONY
First time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .
MAMA
Where was I?
TONY
...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.
I hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?
MAMA
(interrupts)
You ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....
TONY
That's right! That's right. What did you expect!
MAMA
(interrupts)
.that's what you brought into this
i&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....
TONY
What do you expect now? To be loved?
You got no love in you, Mama.
What do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.
MAMA
(interrupts)
Somebody? You're proud? You're a
(Escoria!)
nothing. You're an animal!
Tony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.
MAMA
God help me, what have I done to you?
You were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....
Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.
218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218
Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly
closing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips
open her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the
doorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony
takes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.
CUT TO
219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219
Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies
the house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,
not calling attention to itself.
Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the
crystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.
TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
Wait here.
He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.
Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.
MANNY
(surprised)
Tony?
Tony stares, stunned.
Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a
big smile of welcome for her brother.
GINA
Tony!
(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)
Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.
Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.
MANNY
Hey Tony, c'mon we was....
The gun fires.
GINA
Tony! No!
Tony fires a second time.
Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.
Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
Manny lies at his feet, dead.
GINA
Manny!
She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.
GINA
Manny!
She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.
GINA
You killed him?
Shaking her head at him incredulously.
GINA
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.
Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.
GINA
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?
What'd he do?
She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes
horrible strangled sounds with her throat.
Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.
CHI-CHI
Tony, come on. We gotta get out of here
(to Gina)
Come on baby...Gina!
Suddenly she goes berserk.
GINA
Noooooooooooo!
And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.
Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.
220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220
Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.
Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
the pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.
ERNIE
(to Chi-Chi)
Get the body!
Tony, back at the door, looks down again.
The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.
Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.
CHI-CHI
Tony!
Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.
TONY
Yeah!
He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.
Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.
The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.
GINA
Manny! ...Manny! No!
CUT TO -
221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221
The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.
222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222
It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,
gravel flying.
The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the
shadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.
Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.
223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223
Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the front
door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting
for them at the door.
Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.
CHI-CHI
What do we do with her Tony?
TONY
Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
Put her in my bedroom.
(to Gina)
It'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take
care of you....
She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.
They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.
224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224
Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.
Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.
CHI-CHI
We got some pills into her, she's cooling down.
Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.
Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.
Pause as he lets it sink in.
CHI-CHI
(worried)
Boss, what we gonna do now?
TONY
Do? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.
We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that
fucker down.
Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.
CHI-CHI
(eyeing the coke)
Hey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?
Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.
Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.
Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.
CUT TO
225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225
The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.
A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.
The monkeys listen quietly.
The flamingoes flutter.
. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...
. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.
. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
balustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically
catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.
TONY
(insensate)
. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....
His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.
Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!
TONY
...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...
Well what the hell happened, hunh?
What the hell happened to us?...
In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:
The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring
out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.
Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.
A third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate.
On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
incoherent.
TONY
...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would
you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...
As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:
TONY
...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....

226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226
As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.
Tony sees her.
She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.
GINA
Is this what you want Tony?...
Tony shocked.
GINA
You can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.
She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.
The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.
GINA
I'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.
Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.
GINA
Come and get me Tony. Before it's too late.
He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.
GINA
Come on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:
A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.
Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.
Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.
The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.
Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---
ERNIE
Get outta here!
Tony, they're everywhere!
Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.
We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.
Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.
TONY
(gently)
Hey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.
Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.
TONY tx:
Come on Gina, get off the floor.
You're all dirty now, you need a bath...
Mami's gonna be angry baby
-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..
Come on open your eyes my baby,
open your eyes.. -give me a smile.
There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
pounding it.
CHI-CHI
Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!
On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
goes off, blows him up against the door.
TONY
Cheeee!
He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.
On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,
talking to himself.
TONY
So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.
Karroooomph!
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.
It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.
Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.
TONY
Whores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?
Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.
TONY
Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!
Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
away. Laughing like a madman.
TONY
You need an army you hear! An army to kill me!
Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.
TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!
The Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.
Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below.
He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.
As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.
The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:
"THE WORLD IS YOURS"
And so, for the brief moment, it was.
Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word "Chivato" in blood on the outside walls,
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay

I been dreaming ‘bout this since my mom was packing sandwiches
Ever since, Gav was movin’ packs up out in Hamilton
Came back to the block with that Caddi now we managing
What’s that like for motivation
Never needed quotes, I seen the work and dedication
Even though the money coming easy, yeah that right a way
I’m on my knees like Father can we please find another way
Now we rolling, rolling, rolling ‘round
Ducking 12, associated different side of town
Now music was the thing to saved me, when them boys came
Kicking down the door to take me, what the pastor say?
And then them blessings came immediately
I got selfish, shorty said, that’s so conceited of me
You’ll never make it, but his graces wash repeatedly
But now you see me, now you see me, you believe in me
And I’m never going back, they gon’ talk a lot of shit to try to knock you off the track
And I’m never going back, they gon’ talk a lot of shit to try to knock you off the track (I’ve been living on the line getting paper)
And I’m never going back, they gon’ say a lot of shit to try to knock you off the track
And we (I’ve been living on the line getting paper, cos I never know, I never know)
I’ve been living on the line gettin’ paper
Cos I never never know, I never know
Steady stack it up
Hold a bag, life’s a lotto, and finesse the dolla
Really I never know
Play the game, roll the dice
And everyday I been alive, I’ve been alive
And maybe I’ll never know 
You’ll see it twice 
Clock is moving fast, I play with hands of time 
Better shoot the shot, now or never
I pick and roll
All around the globe
Slow motion when we roll
Stockton to Malone
Aura like is rose gold
High jump the goal
With no pole vault 
Running out of time
I’m about to lose mind 
Speak about the past like they wanna press rewind 
Never one to follow, I’m just following the signs 
Cos everyday the same shit, every single time 
And I’m never ever

If time just passes by beyond prepared
Don’t doubt that we think this through
Don’t doubt that we think this through
I am sure, this life you can compare
The risk that you take is true
The risk that you take is 

Yeah I'm in a long-distance relationship, and that's probably true
But I just came back from Canada in a month and you with a Muslim
So I probably have sex more often than you
Let's get one thing clear, boy: You don't deserve to be the champ of Britain
But you think we're equal level writers
So let me tell you some stuff this man has written
Remember when you battled Sniper E and pretended his name was Jim for the 3rd round
So you could do an associative wordplay scheme on exercise
And tell him the battle wouldn't "work out"?
Wait, you think we're the same, right?
Well there's more quotes I'd mention, but now it's embarrassing
Cause that means you think Soul might've said it. No, I edit
That round was more like a yoga class
You came dressed up to exercise and spent the whole time stretching
But he said that, and he meant that
Cause he wrote that, and then he read that
But if that's the caliber of rapper that's challenged to be the next champ
Tony shouldn't have thrown it away, he should have kept that
And in that same round you saying you let the lead blam
You like hammers? West Ham, fight rappers, Def Jam
So who's more real: the faggot in the sweatband
Or the dude who's willing to throw a punch and get banned?
Bruv, I can't make tracks like them man, you can't clash like Jed can
So lucky for me, this ain't a Drops or a WebHam
It's right between your eyes, GSP with the headband
Blood everywhere turn this 7D to a RED Cam
I will X man cause you talk about his crop bringing bars to the scene
But I was there 2 years before that tryna carve out that niche
Now you're part of it Cee, my marketing scheme
That got Major promoted, now the star gets fatigued
I'm Commander-in-chief, now you pardoning me?
Pardoning me, but your part in the scene
Is owed part in to me, departing from me
So split my wig like he parred it to me, that's a parting to me
It's a fake front but it sounds good, you're Dolly Parton to me
Still I'm proud cause I gardened this seed, put bark on his tree
Still you shouldn't bark up this tree, cause you try bite but you aren't what you eat
I wore my heart on my sleeve, and watched arteries bleed
So artists like Cee could come and take part in this league
If I didn't stick to bars and defeat you'd find it hard to succeed
So this the spartan regime in the arms of defeat, when the archers release
Act a god and get scarred for your cheek
So either I bury and move to M or it's over like Arsenal's team
Cause I was here before Don't Flop Extra and the Demo Channel
Before the camera team was Bam and Zeek, Fred and Bagnall
Back when Patty Boi's iPhone was the second angle
Back before you got bread to battle, back when you wouldn't even get your travel
You're from the 2012 killer crop
2012 killer crop?
Oh you mean 2012 only here cause of Mark Grist and Blizzard crop
You mean 2012 driven on the road that we built you crop
You mean 2012 bandwagon, spitting cause the hits it got
Bicker lots on Twitter crop, reason vets were quitting crop
Cringey crop, whingy crop, seemed sick if you didn't flop
Cause you only had to compete with CallumBOOM, Eek, and Gibbo crop?
About a killer crop, are you kidding dog?
Some fucking nuclear winter crop
Cause like 4 of you herbs made it the rest of you fucking withered off
And you stand out cause you've got a couple leaves in a crop of twigs and stalks
I'm from that first event they did with Scots, here from the beginning crop
That's Chris and Tom, Gizmo, Kong, Deffinition, Don Silk, and Shots
Scizzahz, Chron, and Richie, dog, the list goes on
And that's what pissed me off, cause you think you're vets and we think we're not
Just cause you can put people under you like Micky, Locksmyth, and Dotz
And they can put people under them like Willzy, Shox, Twisted, Tox
And they can put people under them like Dillon, Rob Wilson, Flawless, and FOS
When will this ego-tripping stop?
People ask why the real vets are so humble and it's because we know
People could do the same to us like Piff and Hom
And they know people could do the same to them like Stig and Prof
And they know people could do the same to them like Jin and Swann
And they know people could do the same to them like the Scribble Jam that Slim was on
All the way back to Kool Moe Dee at house parties in The Bronx
It's like you give them props if they're hot, then sit and watch them flip and flop
Like your disc I copped, Humble Beginnings, stop
Then they're the biggest shot
But this is where the killer crop's ego-tripping stops
When I leave Cee red and split his top he'll switch the mosque for a synagogue
What you think some scene that used to be joke-heavy and bar-light, you think that scene raised itself?
You think he seen Mark Grist and Blizzard pop and then he came to help?
You think I'll let this bandwagon-jumping, style-biting dweeb take the belt?
Then I got 2 words for you, faggot: Behave yourself

When he was in Canada this man got braggadocios
He said – and I quote this
"Fuck being Don’t Flop’s poster boy I’m captain of my own ship"
Now you’re back to get new highs by dragging on an old spliff
Because now you’re on them Don’t Flop posters, boy this man done had his tone switched
Before Tone dipped you were screaming "I don’t have to rep a league I move transcendentally"
Then you changed your tune
So the deal you and Organik made fell through and you’re back to beg it? Please
This man’s pathetic, if you’re not gonna rep a league, tell me what kind of champ that Jed can be
Let’s address how what you say and what you do just doesn’t match up
They say you the man with the words, but if you ain’t a man of your word
Then it’s all chat, cause
Obviously you wanna be the champ, but
You say you don’t wanna represent a league?
Listed, that’s what a champ does
That’s why before this I was boys with Jed, so I’ve gotta destroy a friend
Because when there’s a virus in the system sometimes you’ve gotta cut off your own arm before the poison spreads
I’m on my star of David, every angle’s on point for them
I might scramble your brains like Freudian tests
When it’s grind time, I’m poised and penning a verse with a poison pen
And in Don’t Flop they saw us both grow from boys to men
But you’re on your Benjamin Button, you had to grow to this stage just to get boyed again
Like, how do you disrespect the company and get a title shot like they’re just giving it up
Doesn’t that pose one question? "Whose dick did he suck?"
‘cos this can’t be the type of fool that this brand serves
Then I guess it’s time for a revolution on the brand work
You’re overly emotional, you’re a battle rapper you’ve got a damn nerve
You’re getting drawn out for that heart on your sleeve like tat work
Because when this battle got announced, I had a death in the family
Last thing on my mind was Jed and the rap scene
So I grieved, felt depressed for a second then actually
I got to penning your funeral, you could never get at me
Because I’m a business man, so it’s fuck how I’m feeling and business as usual
Plus, they’re putting chips up, so if I chip chunks out of cause then I can chip in for the funeral
But here’s where me and Soul stay different
Because when his dog died… Soul played victim
Cancelled his battle with Arkaic and had everyone asking if shit was okay with him
You’re weak… I ain’t okay with this
It’s time you drop Pesci’s style, adopt Cobain’s writtens
Take that Death Note of yours and jot your own name in it
Because Soul’s ‘bout to get a whole new beating, I’m ‘bout to go crate digging
And I’m sorry if you lot feel like I’m wrong for this angle
But you said depression helps you in battle rap? Not in this battle
Because If I say I’m ‘bout to top myself I brought lines to match my best shit
If he says he’s ‘bout to top himself I’m dialing paramedics
And if I’m talking dope, I mean I am that guy
If they’re talking dopamine, you lack that, right?
And I ain’t a Sadist I don’t say this for no reason
But depression runs your life, down to the cadence that you speak in
Talking like you believe you’re the greatest it’s deceiving
It’s degrading to the scene, your senior status is decreasing
Your life is defaced by depression this ain’t the face to rep the league with
Plus he’s moving sketchy when he claims to pledge allegiance
Now they know you in Canada, but do you think having a name is an achievement?
You’re in the pool with the big fish, round here being bait just gets you eaten
I’m on my predator shit
I’m a shark in the water, me and Soul (Sole) a whole different kettle of fish
You won’t make an impact with Cee, unless you allow your depression to win
And dive head first off the edge of a cliff
You lonely, depressed emotional wreck
Passive aggressive, manic depressive
Losing the company money because he can’t keep his emotions in check (cheque)
So how do you plan to sell a brand to the world
When a depressed little bitch is how he’s branding himself
While all of us hungry spitters are sat on the shelf
You lot are throwing him the rope… and he’s hanging himself
So as far as I’m concerned, Jed can get the belt
And you can have a champ tryna represent the league, that can’t even represent 
1 ContributorBorn Again. LyricsIntro:
Dim the lights, it’s like 4am
So much fire out my window pane
I feel the power but I feel the pain
No need to tell you how I do my thing
Verse 1:
Sucks to say that I’ve failed
For the nights it costs it ain’t worth it
But the grind don’t stop
I got the juice, but I know it’s never enough
Born with a crown for my head
That’s another perk of being royal
Still I stick to the plan
Can’t lose my focus, time is going
How did I think it’d be easy?
Oh my God won’t you come free me
I wanna do this, I wanna do that
Cause I see no danger in my path
Fell in line you knew my name
I followed the plan and your better ways
Thanking God for the day
Cause tomorrow might be too far away
You might also likeBridge:
God is the greatest
How do I say this?
My words are nothing but a cadence
What am I running from?
You know what’s funny
I don’t need a drink just to say this
Am I the only one?
Certainly your love has shown me something
Today I’m nothing like a Phenom
But my passion’s enough to defeat em
I do my stunts like a beginner
But all the time I still make it look easy
Ain’t my fault mon dieu’s riding with me
Le diable n’a pas une chance
Knew I was born as a winner
I ball in the summer no sleep in the winter
Got a story to say
But this tale will make you intimidated
Hook:
See all the lights that’s always shining
With all my life I can’t define this
Show me the way your royal highness
I’m feeling the light now. I’m running to sit with the light yah
Sum up my life I’m in the minus
Cannot believe you can refine this
You’ve seen all my pain, seen all my kindness
I’m feeling the light now. I’m breathing with no air inside me
Verse 2:
I’ll be on my way, I’ll be on my way, I’ll be on my way, right now
Don’t run to me I’m not your savior for the week, oh God
I get weak hearing the small talk
So I eat the word it makes me stand tall
No need to flex when I ain’t worked out for days
Humble for the bros who know how we came
Quit working and working, day and night
Stop trying to get the bag that’s getting old
It’s 2018 you’re getting old
One time for the Bible it’s never old
Man I’m tired of these calculations
Made this while writing math equations
It’s a logical conversation
I can’t be bound by these limitations
Hook:
See all the lights that’s always shining
With all my life I can’t define this
Show me the way your royal highness
I’m feeling the light now. I’m running to sit with the light yah
Sum up my life I’m in the minus
Cannot believe you can refine this
You’ve seen all my pain, seen all my kindness
I’m feeling the light now. I’m breathing with no air inside me
Outro Rap:
This is your delta alpha speaking
Life is Beta when I Gamma my mind on you
Can I live like Jenga, stack the highest, and also become a singer?
What’s your will your highness?
I stayed warm when the day was minus
Now I’m cold on the inside, burning on the outside
Tell me what to do when the love’s gone Southside

SERGEANT: Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth Street?

OFFICER: No. Plain drunkenness.

SERGEANT: This says he was picked up there.

OFFICER: They had him on the carpet for an hour at Headquarters. He's clear. Plain drunkenness.

SERGEANT: Young squirt.  All right--You want to lean him against something? Stand him over there.
[The officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against
the wall beside it.]
[JIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The OFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take it, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back and moves away. Another officer enters and leads the
prisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room. JIM sits beside her. He smiles at her but receives only a chilling look. He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing on the floor, but she is not amused. Camera pans to show others reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO look up and smile a little.]


RAY: Judy--we're ready for you now.
JUDY (a mumble): He hates me.
RAY: What?
JUDY: He hates me.
[She rises. RAY leads her to one of the glass-walled offices.
Camera moves with them.  JIM watches them go.]
RAY: What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
JUDY: I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn't like my friends--he--

JUDY (continuing): He doesn't like anything about me--he calls me--he calls me--

RAY: He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
JUDY (crying): He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
RAY: Do you think your father means that?
JUDY: Yes! No… I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're all together and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
RAY: That one?
JUDY: Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
RAY: Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
JUDY: I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
RAY: You weren't looking for company, were you?
JUDY: No.
RAY: Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
JUDY: No.  I don't even know why I do it.
RAY: Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
JUDY: I’ll never get close to anybody.
RAY: Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
JUDY: You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
RAY: Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?
RAY (to WOMAN OFFICER): Did you notify the parents?
WOMAN OFFICER: She wouldn't give me their number.
RAY: What's your number, Judy?  We'll see if your Dad will come and get you.

RAY: Unless you really don't want to go home. Would you rather stay here?
[Camera moves close on JUDY.  She looks up and speaks very
quietly.]
JUDY: Lexington 05549.


[Med. shot, PLATO and NEGRO WOMAN.  PLATO smiles faintly and moves out toward JIM, NEGRO WOMAN following.  Camera pans with them.  PLATO sits by JIM.  She stands over them.  JIM's wailing continues. Med. shot.  JIM, PLATO, NEGRO WOMAN.  An OFFICER moves into shot.
OFFICER: Hey!

OFFICER: Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
[The OFFICER moves out.  The NEGRO WOMAN bends over PLATO who
is shivering violently. JIM notices him.]
JIM: Want my jacket?

JIM: You want my jacket?  It's warm.

[Full shot.  JUDY's office.  RAY and JUDY seated as before.
JUDY is still gazing through the glass.]
RAY: Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
JUDY: What?
RAY: Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
JUDY (startled): My mother?

RAY: She's being called for.
JUDY: You said you'd call my father.
RAY: Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.

GENE: John Crawford?
NEGRO WOMAN: Yes, sir.
GENE: Come with me, John.

MOTHER: Jim!
[JIM looks up suddenly, scared.  Then he smiles mysteriously
and staggers to his feet. Low angle.  Tight three.  JIM's parents and grandma framed in the doorway, frozen.  They are all dressed in evening clothes.  The MOTHER is a very chic but rather hard-faced woman.  The FATHER is an unfeathered man.  The GRANDMA is the smallest, also very chic and very bright-eyed. Med. shot.  JIM as he faces them.]
JIM: Happy Easter.
MOTHER: Where were you tonight?  They called us at the club and I got the fright of my life!
FATHER: Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

JIM: You think I'm funny?

JIM: Why didn't you take my jacket?

GENE: John? John? John? Do you have any idea why you shot those puppies, John? Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
PLATO: Plato.
NEGRO WOMAN: You talk to the man nice now, hear? He's going to help you.
PLATO: Nobody can help me.
GENE: Where did you get the gun?
PLATO: In my mother's drawer.
NEGRO WOMAN: She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
GENE: Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
PLATO: She's away.
NEGRO WOMAN: Seems like she's always going somewhere.  She got a sister in Chicago and she go for the holiday. She says her sister is all the family she has.
GENE: Where's your father?

NEGRO WOMAN: They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
GENE: Do you hear from him, son?

GENE: You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
PLATO (smiling a bit): Head-shrinker?
NEGRO WOMAN: Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
GENE: Well maybe she better start.
[Other office.  JIM, his parents, GRANDMA and RAY are gathered in the small room.  JIM is humming THE RIDE OF THE VALKRYIES to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in what is happening around him.  RAY suspects this is
something more than mere disinterest, so lets the humming go on, in order to discover its real purpose.  GRANDMA watches everything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy.  No one pays any attention to her.  For a moment no one talks.  RAY watches JIM as he hums.  Then the FATHER shakes his head and looks up.]
FATHER: I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
RAY: You don't?
FATHER: No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
RAY: He’s a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
FATHER: Say, listen--
MOTHER: Jim--don't hum.
[JIM merely rolls his eyes at her, then away--but continues
his humming.]
FATHER: I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
MOTHER: Really, Frank?  When was that?
RAY: What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?

RAY: Not interested, huh?

MOTHER: Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
FATHER: He's just loaded, honey.
MOTHER: I was talking to Jim.
FATHER (to RAY): Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
JIM: Tell him why we moved here.
FATHER: Hold it, Jim.
JIM: You can't protect me.
FATHER (to JIM): You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?
FATHER (to RAY): I try to get to him--what happens?
FATHER (to JIM): Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
JIM: You buy me many things.  Thank you.
FATHER: Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?

FATHER: Then what is it?  I can't even touch you anymore but you pull away. I want to understand you.  Why'd you get drunk?  You must have had a reason.

FATHER: Was it because we went to that party? You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into--it's no place for kids.
MOTHER: A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
GRANDMA: He said a little drink.
JIM (exploding): You're tearing me apart!
MOTHER: What?
JIM: You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
MOTHER: That's a fine way to behave!
GRANDMA: Well you know who he takes after!
RAY: Outside, Jim.  Come outside.

RAY: Excuse us a minute?
FATHER: Sure.  Sure.

JIM: Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
RAY: Grandma?

JIM: Get lost.
RAY: Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
JIM: Wash up and go home.
RAY: Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?

RAY: Too bad you didn’t connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
JIM: No.
RAY: Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
JIM: Leave me alone.
RAY: No.
JIM: I don't know why--!
RAY: Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
JIM: I just get so--
JIM (fighting tears): Boy, sometimes the temperature goes
way up.
RAY (suddenly gentle): Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

RAY: You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
JIM: All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
RAY: Try the desk.

RAY: That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
JIM: And they think they are protecting me by moving.
RAY: You were getting a good star in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
JIM: Mess that kid up?

JIM: He called me chicken.
RAY: And your folks didn't understand?
JIM: They never do.
RAY: So then you moved?
JIM: They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
RAY: But you don't think that's a solution.

RAY: Things pretty tough for you at home?
JIM: She eats him alive and he takes it.

JIM: What a zoo!
RAY: What?
JIM: A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
RAY: Pretty mixed up?
JIM: If he could--
RAY: “If he could" what?  You mean your father?
JIM: I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
RAY: Chicken?
JIM: I bet you see right through me, don't you?

JIM: How can anyone grow up in this circus?
RAY: You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
JIM (as RAY gets a cup of water from cooler): Boy--if I had one day when I didn't  have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place…
RAY (giving him water): Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
JIM: Okay--
RAY: Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
JIM (smiling): You serious?

JIM: I’m sorry.
MOTHER: All right, darling.

GRANDMA (to RAY): This was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry--so we're not going to have any more trouble.  He's always been a lovely boy--
JIM: Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone.
RAY: Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
FATHER (offering RAY three cigars): Have some cigars.
RAY: No thanks, I don't smoke.
FATHER: Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
RAY: No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
MOTHER: Frank--he doesn't want any.


[JIM’s house.  JIM is in f.g. looking out through the curtains.  He
smiles.]
MOTHER: Your eggs are on the table, dear.

MOTHER: Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
JIM (approaching table): It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
MOTHER: Well, drink your milk anyhow.
JIM (still standing; he drinks): You make any sandwiches?
FATHER: My first day of school, Mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
MOTHER (bringing bag of lunch from buffet): There's nothing to be nervous about. Here's peanut butter and meat loaf--

GRANDMA: What did I tell you?  Peanut butter!
MOTHER: Well, there's a thermos of orange juice and some apple-sauce cake in the wax paper to wash it down.
GRANDMA: I baked that!
JIM (kisses her cheek): Bye, Mom.
MOTHER: Goodbye, dear.
FATHER (rising): So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
JIM: Sure--
FATHER: And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--

[Full shot.  JIM's backyard as JIM comes out of the kitchen
door into the early sunshine. JIM blinks, pauses and sees JUDY.  He takes off his tie and puts it in his pocket.  Then he starts across the backyard, camera panning with him to: Full shot.  The Alley with JIM coming out his gate, JUDY and BEAU visible beyond.  He stops again.]
JUDY: Beau!  All right--go to school alone!

JIM (calling): Hey!

JIM (continuing): Hey, didn't I see you before some place?

JIM: Hi.  I saw you before.
JUDY: Bully for you.
JIM: You don't have to be unfriendly.
JUDY: Now that's true!
JIM (smiling): See?
JUDY: “Life is crushing in on me."
JIM (smiling): "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
JUDY: Where what was.
JIM: Where I saw you. Everything going okay now? You live around here?
JUDY (relieved): Who lives?
JIM: See, I'm new. I was just getting my car.  I could take you.

JUDY: The kids take me.
JIM: Oh.

JUDY (yelling over horn): Goodbye!  See you!

BUZZ: Stella-a-a-a!

JUDY: Steady, Marlon!
BUZZ: Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?

BUZZ: (looks after JIM then at JUDY): What's that?
JUDY: A new disease.
BUZZ: Friend of yours?

JIM: Where's University and 10th?
JUDY (pointing right): That way!
CHICK (pointing left): That way!
BUZZ (pointing up): That way!

[Close shot.  Bicycle rack.  Wheels spin in, one after another and drive straight into their slots.  As the nearest bike moves in: Med. shot.  PLATO just getting off his motor scooter.  He comes forward, passes camera which pans with him then
stops--as the school is suddenly revealed.  Music starts with a crash and keeps mounting through the following. PLATO sighs and moves away from us to join the parade of students filling the Main approach. Parking lot as cars scream into their places noisily.  JIM gets out of one and comes forward.  A motorcycle roars by, just missing him.  JIM stares off and starts to move as camera pans with him to: Another angle.  School.  Another crash of music.  JIM moves toward the parade. Full shot.  Mid-way down main approach.  A number of kids pass, gossiping happily as they greet each other for the first time since vacation.  Camera searches over them and stops upon our special group moving toward us--BUZZ, JUDY and the rest, all abreast.  Others must park at their passage or be elbowed out of the way, staring resentfully, but not daring to challenge the group's priority.  PLATO runs forward, past them. Door from within bouncing from hand to hand as students enter.  PLATO moves through the door and disappears in a milling of kids.  JUDY enters with her group and moves on with them. Med. shot.  Monitor (inside corridor).  The Monitor is an athletic letter-sweater boy with an arm brassard that bears the letters "HC".  Kids pour past him.  JIM enters.]
[Angle shot.  Corridor.  Shooting past a row of steel lockers. The clash and slam of doors as kids throw in coats, pull out books and primp for the day ahead.  PLATO comes to his locker, which is the nearest, and opens it. Full shot.  Corridor.  JIM moves toward us from the distance. Crowded at the entrance to a classroom in f.g. are JUDY and her pals.  They are sneaking a smoke, passing the cigarette from one cupped hand to another.  As JIM comes near, JUDY sees him.  So do the others.  They fold their arms across their chests and whistle "We are the girls of the institute"--all but JUDY.  JIM glances at her and continues on past camera.  A bell starts ringing crazily over the music. Close shot.  PLATO.  He is straightening his tie in the mirror.  Above it, pasted to the locker door, is a still of Alan Ladd. In the mirror we can see JIM moving past.  PLATO sees him too.  He wheels around and stares. Long shot.  JIM moving off down the corridor.  PLATO is in f.g. looking after him.  He slams his locker and starts
after JIM, moving at the same speed and hovering near the wall.  The footsteps of the two boys echo stonily.  They are alone.  JIM stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the corridor.  PLATO stops too. Bulletin board.  JIM looking at the notices.]

LECTURER: For many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star,  increasingly bright and increasingly near.

LECTURER: As this star approaches us, the weather will change.  The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer. The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed.  For the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms. The familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise.

LECTURER: Orion, the Hunter.

JIM: Boy!
PLATO (leaning forward): What?
JIM: Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
LECTURER: Gemini, the Twins.

LECTURER: Cancer, the Crab.

BUZZ: I’m a crab!

LECTURER: Taurus, the Bull.
JIM: Moo!

CRUNCH: Yeah, moo.
BUZZ: Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo.
GOON: Hey, he's real rough--
CRUNCH: I bet he fights with cows.
BUZZ: Moo.

LECTURER: Sagittarius and Aries--all as they have ever been.

PLATO: You shouldn't monkey with him.
JIM: What?
PLATO: He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
JIM: I don't want to make friends.

LECTURER: And while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance--

LECTURER: Has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came.

LECTURER: Destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire.
[The sky is blasted by a wild flash of light.  Music reaches explosion.  The stars appear again. Moving shot.  Faces of normal kids watching seriously--very
impressed.]
LECTURER: The heavens are still and cold once more.  In all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the Earth will not be missed.

LECTURER: Through the infinite reaches of space, the problems of Man seem trivial and naive indeed.  And Man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences.

LECTURER: That's all.  Thank you very much.

JIM: Hey, it's over.  The world ended.

PLATO: What does he know about Man alone?

TEACHER: May I have your attention?  May I please have your attention?  Classes will meet at the busses outside.  May I have your attention?

TEACHER (to herself): The heck with it.

PLATO: Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
JIM: No.  In the morning.
[Planetarium parking lot.  School busses and autos, some new and some heaps, are parked in f.g.  Beyond is the dome of
the Planetarium.  Kids mill about, some already driving off in their cars.  One bus, already full, pulls past camera. Front of bus seen from within.  Driver in f.g.
Kids swarm up the steps and enter.  The group seen from the rear.  PLATO in the distance facing them.]
BUZZ: What you looking at?
PLATO: Nothing.
He runs off, camera panning with him.  Planetarium as PLATO rushes in, out of
breath, stops and looks around.  In distance he sees JIM leaning over the pendulum pit, smoking quietly.  PLATO doesn't move.  JIM hasn't even looked up.]
PLATO: What's your name!
JIM: Jim.  What's yours?
PLATO: Plato.  It's a nickname.

PLATO: Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
JIM: I know.  That's why I came back.
PLATO: You scared?
JIM: I just don't want trouble.
PLATO: He has a knife.
JIM: I saw it.
PLATO: If you don't want trouble, I know a place we can go--

PLATO: It's a big mansion and we could sneak around there and they wouldn't even know.  You could be safe--

PLATO: There it is.

JIM (wearily): You know something?
BUZZ: What?
JIM (reproachfully): You watch too much television.

BUZZ: Hey, he's real abstract and different.
JIM: I’m cute, too.

JIM: Meaning me?
BUZZ: What?
JIM: Chicken?

JIM: You shouldn't call me that.
[PLATO watching anxiously. BUZZ with JUDY watching above him.  JIM enters
shot until he is close to BUZZ's face.  He looks up at JUDY. Camera closes in until we are tight on the three.  The heads are nearly touching.]
JIM (softly to JUDY): You always at ringside?  You always travel in this rank company?

JIM: I thought only punks fought with  knives.
BUZZ: Somebody find him a knife.

PLATO: Jim!

BUZZ: You know the action?  No cutting. Just sticking--jab real cool.

BUZZ (as he maneuvers): What you waiting on, Toreador?  I thought you wanted some action!

BUZZ: Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah! Hah!
GOON: Moo!
BUZZ: Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us. What's happening?  Let's go!
JIM: I don't want trouble.
BUZZ: You crud chicken!  You're wasting our time!

BUZZ: Yeah--that's pretty close.  How about a little closer, Toreador? Cut off a button and you get to join the club!

GUIDE (turning): Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble!

GUIDE: Look.  There's your audience.
LECTURER: Oh, I don't think so.  From the school?

GROUP: Ole!  Ole!

MIL: Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain!
BUZZ (smiling as he sees PLATO): Hey!  Chicken Little!

JIM: All right--you want it, you got it!

CRUNCH: Honk.  Let's split.

BUZZ: Split for what?  Couple old poopheads?

JIM: You satisfied or you want more?
BUZZ: How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
JUDY: Buzzie--we better get out of here.
BUZZ: What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
JIM: Where can we meet?
BUZZ: Know the Millertown bluff?
COOKIE: The bluff, Buzz!  That's dangerous up there.
BUZZ: Draw him a picture, Chicken Little. Eight o'clock.  Cookie, you call Moose and get a couple cars.  We're going to have us some real kicks. Little chickie-run.  You been on chickie-runs before?
JIM: Sure--that's all I do.

GUIDE: All right--all of you--start moving!
JUDY: You mean l'il ol' us?  What's the matter with the nice man?
GUIDE: Don't clown with me.
BUZZ: Why'nt you go suck on something sweet?
GUIDE: You think you're tough?  I got a  son twice your size and I can still  handle him.
LECTURER: Don't lose control, Mr. Jamison.  I think if we just explain--
GUIDE: Explain to these?  They think they own the world!
CRUNCH: The world is round!
MIL: The world is flat!
COOKIE: All the world's a stage!

PLATO: Are you really going to meet them?
JIM: Who knows.  …Plato?
PLATO: What?
JIM: What's a chickie-run?


JIM: Mom?

FATHER: Hiya, Jimbo.

FATHER: You thought I was Mom?
JIM: Yeah!
FATHER: It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
JIM (giggling): And you dropped it?
FATHER (laughing too): Yeah!  Shh!
JIM: That's funny!
FATHER: I better clean this up before she sees it.

JIM: Let her see.  What could happen?

JIM: Dad--

JIM: Dad--don't.  Don't.


JUDY (quietly, afraid): Didn't you forget something?
JUDY'S FATHER: What?

JUDY'S FATHER (continuing; shocked): What's the matter with you?

JUDY'S FATHER: You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
JUDY (very hurt): I didn't want to stop.

JUDY'S MOTHER: Didn't want to stop what?
JUDY'S FATHER: Nothing.
JUDY: I was talking to Dad.
JUDY'S FATHER: I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
JUDY'S MOTHER (calling to kitchen) Bertha!  You can serve the souffle! (to FATHER) Fish souffle. (to JUDY) You don't have to stand there, darling.  Drink your tomato juice.

JUDY: I guess I just don't understand anything.
JUDY'S FATHER: I’m tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
JUDY: Why?
JUDY'S FATHER: I’d like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
JUDY: Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?

JUDY'S FATHER: Stop it now!  Sit down!

JUDY'S FATHER: Hi, rascal.
BEAU (hushed): Hi.

JUDY: May I please be excused?

JUDY'S FATHER: Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry.

JUDY'S FATHER: I don't know what to do.  All of a sudden she's a problem.

JUDY'S MOTHER: She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just the age.
BEAU: The atomic age!

JUDY'S MOTHER (kissing her husband's hair): It's the age when nothing fits.

FATHER: You awake?
JIM: Yes.
FATHER: Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
JIM: I’m not hungry.

JIM: Hey--I want to ask you something.
FATHER (happily): Shoot, Jimbo.
JIM: Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
FATHER (laughing): Is there some kind of trick answer?
JIM: What would you do, Dad?
FATHER: I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

JIM: Blood.
FATHER: How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
JIM: The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
FATHER: Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
JIM: We don't have time.
FATHER: We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--

JIM: What can you do when you have to be a man?
FATHER: Well, now--
JIM: Just give me a direct answer! (pause) You going to stop me from going, Dad?
FATHER: You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a  wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
JIM: Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
FATHER: I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--

FATHER: Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't go out till we--Jim!

FATHER: Jim?  Jim!


BUZZ (calling out): Hey, Chicken-Little.

BUZZ: Where's Toreador?  He beg off?
PLATO: He's not scared of you.
BUZZ (laughing): Yeah? (to GOON) Goon!  You seen that adolescent type anywheres?
COOKIE: He won't show.
GOON: Well, you going to wait all night? I'm getting nervous, man!  We got to do something!
CRUNCH: Hey, Buzz!
BUZZ: What?
COOKIE: Over there.

JIM: How'd you get here?
PLATO: I hitched.
JIM: Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.

BUZZ: Just him.
JIM: Stay there.

BUZZ: What you say your name was?
JIM: Jim Stark.
BUZZ: Buzz Gundersen.
JIM: Hi.
BUZZ: Glad to meet you.

MOOSE: Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.
BUZZ: Flashlight?

BUZZ: Looks good.
MOOSE: Clean as a whistle.  They both got plenty breeze.
BUZZ: Look good to you?
JIM: Sure.  It's fine.
BUZZ: Okay.

JUDY: Is he your friend?
PLATO: …Yeah.  My best friend.
JUDY: What's he like?
PLATO: Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much  but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere. Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more. (laughing) People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
JUDY: Jamie?

BUZZ: Better try the doors.  Jump out.

BUZZ: No--quick, man!  You got to break quick.

BUZZ: This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
JIM: Yeah.
BUZZ: I like you, you know?
JIM: Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
BUZZ: We got to do something.  Don't we?

JUDY: Feel okay?
BUZZ: Give me some dirt.

BUZZ: Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We head for the edge.  The first guy who jumps--chicken!

BUZZ: What's happening?
JUDY: Good luck, Buzz.

JIM (calling softly): Judy.

JIM: Me too.

JIM: Thank you.

BUZZ: Hit your lights!



CROWD: Oh!

JIM (a harsh whisper): Where's Buzz!  Where's Buzz!

PLATO (calling): Jim!  Jim!

CRUNCH (tight fury): Down there!  Down there is Buzz!

PLATO: Come on, Jim!  We got to get out of here!

PLATO: Get up!  Get up!  Come on!

PLATO: Go on!  Move!


JUDY (hardly audible): This is fine--

JIM (calling quietly): Judy.  Will you be okay?

JIM: I got to go in.  You better get home too. (touches PLATO) Hey--what?
PLATO: Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
JIM: Who has?
PLATO: If you want to come we could talk  and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--(pauses--then excitedly as though  an idea had suddenly struck him) Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
JIM (interrupting): Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
PLATO (suddenly, pleasantly): O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
JIM: Yeah.


BEAU (quietly): Hello, little cute sister.

BEAU: Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor-puss, sweetie--

JUDY'S FATHER (calling from his bed): Beau!  You belong in bed!


MOTHER: He's home!  You're home!  You're all right!

MOTHER: What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
JIM: I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
FATHER: Go ahead.
JIM: I’m in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller-town Junction?
FATHER: Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
JIM: I was in it.
MOTHER: How!
JIM: It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
MOTHER: Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
JIM: Mom--I'm not--
MOTHER: And you wanted him to make a list!
FATHER: Will you let him tell it!
JIM: She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
MOTHER: I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
FATHER: Just relax, please relax!
JIM: I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken--you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
MOTHER: Good Lord!
JIM: I can't keep it to myself anymore--
FATHER: Well, just get it off your chest, son.
JIM: That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
FATHER: You're absolutely right!
JIM: Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
FATHER: You what?
MOTHER: No!
FATHER: Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
JIM: I don't think so--
FATHER: Well--
MOTHER: What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
JIM: What's that got to do with it?
MOTHER: Why should you be the only one?
FATHER: Look, Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
MOTHER: Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
FATHER: I’m just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
MOTHER: That's right!
JIM: Except yourself!
FATHER: Will you wait a minute?
JIM: You don't want me to go.
MOTHER: No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
JIM: But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
FATHER: You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
JIM: No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
MOTHER: He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
JIM: Just tell a little white lie?
FATHER: You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
JIM: I don't want to learn that!
MOTHER: Well, it doesn't matter anyhow--because we're moving.
JIM: No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
MOTHER: Do I have to spell it out?
JIM: You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. (silence) Dad?
FATHER: Son--this is all happening so fast--
JIM: You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something (stops as he sees the emptiness in them) Mom?
MOTHER: Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
JIM: Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?

JIM: Dad?

MOTHER: Stop it!  You'll kill him!  Jim! Do you want to kill your father?

[DISSOLVE TO: Outside Precinct Station.  JIM's car comes to a stop at the curb.  JIM gets out and approaches the flight of steps leading up the entrance.  A bare bulb on either side is the only illumination.  As he mounts the first step, the double doors above him swing open revealing several people.  JIM stops short.  So do they. CRUNCH, MOOSE and their parents.  JIM's back in f.g.  The boys stare down at him. JIM (from the boys' point of view) as he stares up at them.  MOOSE's father takes his arm and starts him down the stairs, the others moving too. They move down the steps as JIM breaks away and continues up.
He goes through the doors. Inside doors as JIM comes through and stops.  He looks back through the glass.  We see the group reach the curb where their cars are parked.  There is a brief discussion which we cannot hear, then CRUNCH and MOOSE move off to MOOSE's car. JIM turns back.  He looks worried as he passes camera. CRUNCH and MOOSE.  They stop at MOOSE's car and look back at the entrance.  The parents are seen beyond them, getting into their cars.  CRUNCH is near tears with anger.]
CRUNCH: What's he going to pull--
MOOSE: Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
CRUNCH: You see any cops?
MOOSE'S FATHER (yelling): You monsters start home.  We're going to--
MOOSE: Yeah.  Yeah.
MOOSE'S FATHER: We're following you so better get there.
CRUNCH: You see any cops?
MOOSE: No--
CRUNCH: He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
MOOSE: I think I should go home.
CRUNCH: No.  We're going to bring him down.
MOOSE: Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
CRUNCH (crying): You clean out of your head?  Come on!

SERGEANT (spelling): W-O-J-T-what?
HOODLUM: O-W-I-C-Z.  Wojtowicz.  What's the matter, man?  That's the craziest name in town!  It swings!
JIM: Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
SERGEANT: Look--can't you see I'm writing?
HOODLUM: Man, this cat never stops.  He just keeps going like Big Jay at a session!
OFFICER: Shut up.
JIM: Listen--
SERGEANT (annoyed): He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
JIM: My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
SERGEANT: Come back tomorrow.
JIM: I’ll wait for him.
SERGEANT: Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? (to HOODLUM) Ever been booked before?

PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles. PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around. CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side. All very tense and hotted up!]
PLATO: What do you want?!
CRUNCH: You know what we want.  We want your friend.
GOON: We got eyes for him.
PLATO: Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops are cruising every--
GOON: Where does he live?

CRUNCH: You better tell us and I'm not kidding.
PLATO: My old man's got a gun.
GOON: His old man's got a gun.  What do you think of that! (drives a hard blow at PLATO's belly) Your friend talked--(belts him again) Now you talk!  Talk!

NEGRO WOMAN (yelling): What you doing?!  What you doing to him?!  You clear out of here 'fore I call the police!

NEGRO WOMAN: Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now!
MOOSE: Let's go, Crunch.

NEGRO WOMAN: Why you like to mix with bad boys like that?  Why you get in trouble all the—(sees the gun)  John!  What you doing with that! You leave that be!  Put it down before you hurt yourself.  Hear me?

PLATO: I have to go out.  I have to warn him.
NEGRO WOMAN: John!  You stay home!  John!  John!

ANNOUNCER: Coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to you--from Buzz.

JUDY: They'll be looking for you.
JIM: They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do--kill myself?
JUDY: It doesn't matter to them.
JIM: You were looking for me, weren't you?
JUDY (a small voice): No--I was just--maybe--
JIM: I tried to call you before.
JUDY: I thought so.
JIM: You still pretty upset?
JUDY: I’m numb.
JIM: Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
JUDY: Neither can I.
JIM: No?  Why not? (no answer) You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
JUDY: No.
JIM: Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!

JIM: Hey!  You smiled!

JIM: Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
JUDY: I’m sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
JIM: Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
JUDY: If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
JIM: I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
JUDY: Why?
JIM: I’m getting that way, too.
JUDY (looks at him): Have you ever gone with anyone who--
JIM: Sure.  Lots of times.
JUDY: So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
JIM (smiling): Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.

JUDY: Why did you do that?
JIM: I felt like it.
JUDY: Your lips are soft when you kiss.

JIM: Where you going?
JUDY: I don't know, but we can't stay here.
JIM: Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
JUDY: I’m never going back.
JIM: Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium (rises) Would you go with me?

JIM: You can trust me, Judy.
JUDY: I feel as if I'm walking under water.

MOTHER: Frank?  I'm frightened.
FATHER: What's that pounding?
MOTHER: I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
FATHER: He's home.  I heard the car.
MOTHER: Are you going down there?
FATHER: Look--just relax, will you?

FATHER: See?  It stopped.
MOTHER: I still think you should go down.

FATHER (through the door): Who's there? (silence) Anyone there?
MOTHER: Open it.

FATHER (hoarsely): Who's out there?
VOICE: Where's your son?
FATHER: What?
ANOTHER VOICE: Where's your baby boy gone to, Daddy?  We want him.

FATHER: Look in his room!

FATHER: Jim!  Jim!

FATHER: Son?

FATHER: What are you doing?
PLATO: Where's Jim?
FATHER: I don't know.  Do you--do you know where he is?
PLATO: No.  No, I don't.

PLATO: I know where--

PLATO: Hope I didn't bother you.  Goodnight.

FATHER: Hey, come back here.  Who are you?
DISSOLVE TO: Split screen montage.  It begins with a telephone ringing alone in the corner of the screen.  As camera moves back we see that the phone is in an office at Juvenile Hall.  RAY is standing by, trying to make sense out of the incoming reports. The other part of the screen lights up and becomes: Bedroom of PLATO'S MOTHER where the NEGRO WOMAN is speaking hysterically into the phone. Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  The FATHER is on the phone. BEAU has awakened and is crying.  His MOTHER tries to divert him. JIM's bedroom.  JIM'S FATHER sits disconsolately on the bed, the phone in his hand.  He is talking earnestly. During this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased
to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a deep rising riot of sirens whose wail mounts higher and higher until:]

PLATO: Jim!

JIM (giggling): Rawr! Your house is a mess.
PLATO: They're looking for you!--
JIM: Yeah?
PLATO: Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
JIM: We know.
PLATO: They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
JIM: Judy.
PLATO: Help me in!

PLATO: We're safe here.  I hope. (holds up candelabra) What do you think?
JIM (gazing around): Wow!  Well now-there-then!

PLATO: Isn't it crazy?
JIM: Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
JUDY: Oh, Jim!
JIM: No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
JUDY (laughing): You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
PLATO: Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
JUDY: Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
JIM: Why don't we just rent it for the season?
JUDY: You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
JIM: Well--we're newlyweds.
JUDY: There's just one thing.  What about--
PLATO: Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
JUDY: Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
JIM: Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
JUDY: See, we're very modern.
PLATO: Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
JUDY: Talk to them!  Heavens!
JIM: Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
PLATO: It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
JIM: What?
PLATO: There's only one key.
JIM: We'll take it!
PLATO: Come on!

JIM (yelling): Quick!  Fill the pool!

JIM: Let's see how long we can stay under.
PLATO: Man, you're schizoid!
JIM (in another outburst of laughing): I’m what?  What?
JUDY: You can't talk underwater!
JIM (gargling): I bet you hear everything I say!
PLATO (gargling): Isn't he schizoid?
JIM (gargling): Hey!  How 'bout that!

PLATO: Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
JIM: Not lately.

JIM: How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
PLATO: I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.

JIM: No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble?

PLATO: I don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy now.  Here.

PLATO: I came here before.
JIM: When was that?
PLATO: When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
JIM: Who?
PLATO: Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
JIM: You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
JUDY: Plato, where's your father now?
PLATO: He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea.
JIM: You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
PLATO: I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
JUDY: It's all right.
JIM: Sure.

JIM: Ever been in a place like this before?
JUDY: Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
JIM: How many rooms do you think there are?
JUDY: I don't know.
JIM: Should we explore?
[She looks at PLATO.  JIM shrugs--tests to see if the boy is awake, but there is no reaction. Sees that PLATO has one red sock and one blue sock.
JIM: Hey!
JUDY (giggling): Looks like he was stressed.

JIM: Hey!  Will you look at this room! (looks behind him) Judy?

JUDY: Hi.
JIM (sits beside her): Hi.

JIM: What?
JUDY: Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. (kisses it) You're so funny.
JIM: Why?
JUDY: I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
JIM: Maybe he's scared of the dark.
JUDY: Are you?

JIM: There's something I should tell you, Judy.
JUDY: I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
JIM (laughing): What a relief!

JUDY: Is this what it's like to love somebody?
JIM: You disappointed?
JUDY (mussing her hair): Funny, Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
JIM: What?
JUDY: You smell like baby powder.
JIM: So do you.
JUDY: I never felt so clean before.
JIM: It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
JUDY: I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
JIM: It is for me too.
JUDY: I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.

JIM: I mean it too.

GOON: What you stopping for?
CRUNCH: You scam a car up there?
MOTHER: So what?
CRUNCH: Nobody's lived in that hunk of junk for five-six years.

CRUNCH: Well, what do you know!  I feel a kick coming on!

OFFICER: This is Unit 17.  Unit 17.
RADIO: Come in, Unit 17.
OFFICER: We just zeroed three kids in a heap. Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks like house-breaking.  Send us some help.  They may be armed.  Over.

CRUNCH: Good morning.

CRUNCH: Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The other side.

CRUNCH: Come on!  Let's make it!
[They stream out of the pool after PLATO.  He reaches the glass doors first, streaks though, and bangs them shut behind him. Arcade.  PLATO's face is visible only when the moonlight strikes him through the passing windows.  The sound of running steps behind him. Main room.  A pattern of moonlight on the bare floor as PLATO dashes in and through it.  He falls over a piece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera, wheels around on hands and knees to face the door.  The boys plunge into the moonlit square and stop.  PLATO tries not to
breathe.  A match is struck.  CRUNCH looks around, but can see nothing.  That match goes out.  The boys start up the stairs, whispering.  Immediately, PLATO crawls forward, under the piano.  He hears a murmur of voices from behind the oak door of the library--next to the piano.  He moves to it stealthily. PLATO at door listening through it, on hands and knees.  His confusion mounts.  He shakes his head to clear it.  Then, suddenly he rises and tries the knob.  The door is locked.  He beats on it.]
PLATO: Save me!

PLATO (shrieks): What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
JIM: Plato!

PLATO (screaming): Get off of me! You’re not my father!

JUDY: Jim!

OFFICER (sharply): Halt!

OFFICER (continuing): Come here.

JIM: Plato!

OFFICER: Come here, son.
PLATO: No!
JIM: Plato!
OFFICER: Just walk over here quietly now--and there won't be any trouble.

JIM: Plato!

JUDY: Jim!  Watch out!

FIRST OFFICER: Take the house!  I'll head him off.
Front of mansion.  JUDY flies down the stairs and rushes past camera.]
OFFICER: Halt!  Halt!

RADIO: --located at Summit Drive--the
Planetarium.
RAY: The planetarium?  One kid inside--five housebreaking in area.  Will proceed. (turning to JIM's parents) There are some kids in trouble—you'll have to go with me.
FATHER: Perfectly all right.

JIM (yelling): Plato!

JIM (distant): Plato!

JUDY: Did he hit you?
JIM: No!
JUDY: We have to go back!
JIM: No!  I got to find him.

JUDY: After he tried to shoot you?
JIM: He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
JUDY: He needed you, maybe.  So do I.

JIM: He needs you too.  Come on.

JUDY: You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
JIM: Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
JUDY: They're killing him!

OFFICER: Come out of there.

OFFICER: You're making it tough on yourself, kid.  Come out quietly now.  You didn't kill anybody yet.

OFFICER (running):  Need a little help here!

CHIEF: We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
OFFICER: We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
CHIEF: How'd he get in?
OFFICER: Smashed the front door.
CHIEF: Any other entrance?
OFFICER (leaving): Down in back.

CHIEF (loud on speaker): Silence.  Please maintain silence. Keep back and stay off the pavements.  Keep back and stay off the pavements.  There will be emergency vehicles coming through. This warning is for your own protection.

NEGRO WOMAN: What's going on?
OFFICER: I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in trouble.  Stand back, please.
NEGRO WOMAN: I got to know.  My boy run off tonight.  He had a gun with him, too.

CHIEF: Hello, Ray--Know anything about this?
RAY: As much as you do--Loan me your mike, will you?
CHIEF (handing it to him): Help yourself.
RAY (into mike): I am addressing the boy in the planetarium.  I am speaking to the boy inside.  This is Ray Framek from the Juvenile Division--

RAY (over speaker): You are now surrounded.  You are surrounded by many armed police. Whoever you are, drop your weapon and come outside.

RAY (over speaker): Come outside.  Clasp your hands over your head and come outside quietly--

MOTHER: Frank!
FATHER: Stay here. (goes over to RAY) That was my son!
RAY: You sure?
FATHER: I think I know my son.

RAY (over speaker): Jim Stark!  I'm addressing Jim Stark.  Nobody will harm you or your friends if you follow these instructions.  We are here to protect you.  Drop your guns and come outside.  Nobody will hurt you if you do as I say--

CHIEF: Officers!  Another boy and girl just ran into the planetarium.  We do not know if they are armed. Hold your positions until further instruction.

CHIEF (over speaker): Ambulance.  Ambulance is coming through.  Clear a passage.  Will you people make way there?

JIM (softly): Plato?

JIM (continuing - calling softly): Plato?  Plato, you in there? (silence) Hey, I'm going to open the door now. You'll be able to see me and you can shoot me if you want, but just remember one thing, Plato--You're my friend.  That means a lot to me.

JIM: Plato?
PLATO: I’m here.
JIM: Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
PLATO: I’ve got a gun.
JIM: I know.  Light a match, will you?

JIM: Where are you? Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.

JIM: I’m not going to hurt you.

PLATO: Why did you run out on me?
JIM: We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
PLATO: You sure?
JIM: Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
PLATO: No.
JIM: I promise nothing'll happen if you do. (silence) You want my jacket?  It's warm.

PLATO: Can I keep it?
JIM: What do you think?

JIM: You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
PLATO: My gun?
JIM: In your pocket.  Give it to me.
PLATO: No… no, I need it.
JIM: You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.

PLATO: You promised to give it back.
JIM: Friends never break promises, do they?

JIM:  Now listen.  There are—oh, here (gives him back the gun)—a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You  understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
PLATO: Why?
JIM: They like you.  Okay?
PLATO: Come on!

JUDY: Hi, Plato!
PLATO: Hi.

JIM: Hey, can we dim those lights? Turn off the lights and we’ll come out!

PLATO: Who's that?
JIM: Just a guard.
PLATO: I shot at one of them.
JIM: But you didn't hurt anybody.

PLATO: Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
JIM (tense; calling past camera): Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?

JIM: Turn the lights off!

MOTHER: It's Jim!

JUDY: Plato!

JIM (screaming--wildly, holding up the gun cartridge): But I've got the bullets!

JIM: Plato? (crouches over PLATO) Plato.  Hey, Jerkpot!

JIM (quiet): What did you have to do that for?

FATHER: Let him alone!  He's mine!  I'll take care of him!

RAY: It's all right!  It's all right!

FATHER: For a minute...that jacket...I thought... (breaks off, then) You couldn't help it, son. (reaches out, gently, but firmly) You did everything a man could do.

FATHER: Stand up, Jim.  I'll stand up with you.  Let me try to be as strong as you want me to be.

JIM: He depended on me.
FATHER: And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.

NEGRO WOMAN (as they lift PLATO onto litter): This poor baby got nobody.  Just nobody.

JIM (to JUDY, half to himself): He was always cold.

JIM: Mom--Dad--this is my friend.  Her name is Judy.








Although consoles have traditionally been the platform to offer the best local multiplayer support, that's changing. With the surge in PC power in recent years, there have been games released that fully support both split-screen and "hotseat" multiplayer (nearly all of which also support controller input). Some even support up to 6 simultaneous players. Of course, even games without local multiplayer support can still be played on the same PC... up to 16, in fact. As well as SoftXpand, there's this, which allows screens to be "split" to a second display! Borderlands 2 is one such game that supports local multiplayer... even from the same Steam account.PCs come in many shapes and sizes
















PCs can be built to be small or large. They can be square, round, flat, tall, you name it. You decide what shape best fits your spacial requirements, whether you're buying or building. Both market strategies have in incalculable amount of options. You can get a PC that uses less power than a console. You can get a PC that's quieter than a console. It's great that consoles sit well in those departments, but the PC takes the crown in every one of those categories.A Personal Computer can be used as a tax write-off, whereas a gaming console cannot





















If you can prove it's being used for your work, you can write it off. Even if it's going to have an HD 7990 or Titan. As we've seen in past years, owning a GPU no longer means that you have to play games. Productivity software is becoming increasingly supportive of OpenCL and other GPU compute features and if your work software can leverage it, the IRS has no business telling you that you can't play games with it as well.The human eye can see far beyond a measly 30 or 60FPS





















Contrary to the hordes of uneducated people trying to defend underpowered consoles, you can see a difference between 30FPS and 60FPS . There are many sources of confusion. The first is YouTube. Yes, YouTube. Lots of people use YouTube as a test suite to compare 30FPS and 60FPS+. Bad idea! YouTube caps video framerates at 30FPS!. Before doing so, be sure the video you are watching is 60fps compatible as youtube just recently uncapped its video's framerate. The second source of confusion is sometimes an individual's own hardware. This doesn't really apply to the 30-60 debate, but it does apply to 60+. Both Europe and the US tend to adhere to a strict 50/60FPS cap (sans the 'premium' displays you can buy). This would explain why people don't see a difference between 60 and anything more, because the display they're using is only refreshing 60 times a second (60Hz). The last and final source of confusion on this matter is whether or not the human eye can distinguish between the individual frames rather than see them as a slideshow. The answer is no, they cannot... which is the entire point! You can, however, see an improvement in fluidity when the Hz (hertz/refresh rate/FPS) of your system and display are increased. Here's an in-browser 30-vs-60 test if you still don't believe it, and another with actual game footage.
Also, the argument about ~24FPS providing a "better cinematic experience" is completely made up. The film industry adopted 24FPS as a standard because back in the 1930s, higher framerate films took up too much physical film and lower framerate films were difficult to synchronize with the audio. Games don't need framerate caps because frames are generated in realtime as many times per second as your graphics card can handle, displayed to the screen, and then removed from memory to make room for the next frame.Anything with a framerate below 46FPS could strain the human eye





















The majority of console titles target 30 (at 1080p) and occasionally a smooth 60 (although at a meager 720p). Due to the severe hardware limitations of the PS4 and XBox One, almost no titles at the time of this writing are capable of both 1080p and 60FPS. Thomas Edison himself concluded that anything below 46FPS will strain the human eye, with strain increasing as the framerate lowers. This was back in the days of film strips, so the bar is probably a bit lower now than it was then, but eye strain still exists and there's a way to avoid it.The human eye can see the difference between 60 FOV and 90 FOV





















It's hilarious that some people would try to argue this, yet they sometimes do. The problem with a lot of console titles is that the developers have to narrow the field of view to reduce the stress on their target console's weaker hardware. To give you a glimpse of what you're missing out on, see this image . Although some titles have the same field of view across all platforms, ones that are graphically intensive (like Battlefield 4, Skyrim, COD, etc) will often have a reduced FOV on the console version. The best part of it all, if you really do prefer a lower FOV in a given game or need to lower it for medical reasons (vertigo, etc) the PC version will almost always offer an FOV slider or other way to change the FOV. The PCGamingWiki is and absolutely superb resource for information on how to tweak the FOV (among other things, like resolution and detail).Academic studies have proven that higher framerates increase player performance





















Researchers at the University of Massachusetts have determined through observation that not only is the difference noticeable, but player performance increases logarithmically up to 60FPS (logarithmically means the largest increases happen early on and begin to taper off, see rough example here ). Unfortunately, they didn't test with framerates over 60, so we can intelligently theorize (but not scientifically prove) that this also applies to framerates beyond 60. They also concluded (since the curve is logarithmic) that framerates lower than 30 get almost exponentially worse, which is unfortunate because almost every "next-gen" demo so far has shown to dip as low as 10-20FPS while rendering heavier scenes.After your PC loses its luster 3-4 years down the road, overclocking can bring it back





















Let's face the facts. PCs aren't consoles; they improve every year and game developers adjust their games accordingly. If you get sick of running your games on medium and low instead of your traditional high or ultra, overclocking may be the answer. Overclocking is free and it's not as dangerous as it sounds. Performance gains vary, but once your parts are out of their warranty period you no longer have to worry about voiding it. Normally, even a small increase would void it. Of course, you could always just buy faster hardware, but thanks to overclocking you may not need to... at least for another year or so.You can share your Steam games with others





















Contrary to popular belief, your Steam games are not stuck with your account. Steam Family Sharing allows you to instantly lend your digitally-distributed games to another Steam user's library. Even if they're across the country... or world. It's instantly in their library. Unlike physical media, they cannot steal, lose, or damage your game in any way. The only downside is, you need to download the games with your account on their PC first.The games you buy on PC are yours forever





















Did you sell your PC or migrate to a different one? No problem. Just log into Steam, GOG, or Desura and re-download them to your new machine. No need to insert a disc or re-buy an online key like you would with a console. There's also no limit on your number of downloads. The speeds at which you download your games are as fast as your download bandwidth, so you can sometimes re-obtain your games in a matter of minutes.PCs are better for couch, TV, and livingroom gaming than consoles





















Just plug your PC into your TV using the HDMI port. Controllers compliment this very well, especially since a PC can use any controller (even a combination of different ones at the same time)! However, mouse and keyboard combinations are just as easy to do if you have a proper piece of furniture to support everything. Here's a video  by BlackBusterCritic explaining how this is possible and fighting the misinformation spreaders that say otherwise. Another big factor is the resolution output of your PC. TVs of today are 1080p and higher; sometimes even 4K (4x as dense as 1080p)! Mainstream consoles can hardly handle 900p, let alone 1080p... Using a PC with these TVs rather than an underpowered console will ensure you hit the level of clarity the TV was designed for, not what the console drags it down to. Any resolution other than a display's native resolution will look blurry in comparison to what it was designed for, and you'll notice this pretty quick when you hook your PC up to your TV.PCs are capable of much more than gaming, such as content creation





















Think of it in terms of 'how much am I saving?'. Not 'how much am I spending?'. A PC can do so many things in this day and age it's ridiculous. All things considered, you can still get a PC for the same price of a console if you really care about price equality that much. If you're already a content creator with a powerful machine, congratulations!You can put your console budget toward your existing or upcoming desktop PC.





















Why not put the console budget toward your PC? It's already built! Just add a graphics card!Both the PS4 and XBox One consoles are still behind mid-range gaming PCs of today





















Modern consoles like the PS4 and XBox One use an enhanced AMD A10, which is a mid-range budget processor. Back when the XBox 360 and PS3 came out, things were different. The XBox 360 and PS3 were both very competitive with equivalent PCs, and they were sold at a tremendous loss, even with their $700 price tags. Consoles now are being sold for $400-$500 and making healthy profits on the hardware alone, (at least after their first single game and round of online access payments, if not immediately) ... and yet they continue to raise the prices for online access/special services and increase their cuts for per-game sales. The last-gen prices aren't even adjusted to inflation, either! It really says something about console innovation when you have to adjust for inflation to compare across generations, doesn't it?Console gaming was (at one point) far better than anything PCs had to offer





















We don't try to hide the truth here. Quite the opposite, actually. Yes, at one point consoles had far better graphical capabilities than the PC. Up until the popularity boom of the Apple II and Commodore 64, PCs were barely more than word processors. But then it became 1985. Consoles have continued to stick around over the years but their time has long passed. The only advantages that consoles have left (since the late 80's) are market share, high profitability for the companies building them, expensive games, and exclusives. The middle being hardly anything to brag about as a console user (hey, look how much I spent on this!). These days, games aren't exclusive simply because that's the only system that can handle it; games are exclusives because Microsoft and Sony use their ill-earned profits to influence starving developers. Especially Microsoft. Look at that, PS4 owner. Microsoft loves you so much that they had to pay the studio money just so they wouldn't release their existing game on your platform. Isn't big business with console monopolies fun?!PCs can be legally opened for cleaning, upgrades, and repairs





















Let's face it. If your device relies on fan cooling or has vents, it's going to get dusty and eventually very hot. If it contains circuit boards, it's going to be susceptible to power surges and other electrical problems. It doesn't matter who builds the products or where it comes from. No electronic device is invulnerable. Luckily for you, you get to handle things yourself if/when your PC has a problem with an individual part. Consoles aren't so forgiving. If you clean it yourself, the warranty is most likely void. If a part fails, you have to send the entire thing in and wait for it to be sent back. Sometimes you can even continue using the PC while waiting for the individual part to be replaced! Things like RAM cards, hard drives, graphics cards are good examples. Get a PC and you won't have to be afraid of voiding a warranty ever again as long as you're not physically violating the warranty agreement for the part. Repairing is frowned upon with the XBox most of all.PC parts have longer warranties and the warranties are on a per-part basis; not per-device!





















Each individual part that you view online has a warranty policy directly from the manufacturer that you can see a summary of. Many parts (like Patriot RAM) even have lifetime warranties. Once you receive the PC components, you'll see that a copy of the warranty (with instructions) is included. If the part goes bad within the warranty period, (1-3 years, sometimes lifetime) the company will mail you back a functional replacement. In comparison, a console requires the entire device to be sent in... sometimes after you've already paid more money for the warranty! Disassembling it to send them the defective part would not only be difficult because the warranty would instantly be invalidated on the console, but also because the part is useless to you outside of the device (from a warranty standpoint, they won't honor it or even acknowledge the part belongs to their console).You can experience beautiful studio-quality voice communication for free using a PC





















With consoles, Steam, and Skype, cell phones, etc, your voice communications are routed through a server and relayed to the recipient. Mumble doesn't do that, it goes straight from point A to point B, which means less latency and less stutter (assuming you're hosting the Murmur server). On a PC, you have the option of hosting a Mumble (or TeamSpeak) server. Mumble is free and open source, and allows you (the server host) to set the bandwidth cap as high as you want. Both the server and client are very lightweight, but if you feel that hosting it yourself won't work you can also rent one. TeamSpeak is also an option, but Mumble is open source and nearly identical. As the host, you can decide how many rooms the server will have, the maximum occupancy, and much more. Just make sure that you port-forward if you host a Mumble server (Murmur) yourself. Oh, you could also join our Mumble server!All platforms have their own exclusives but PC has thousands more than any other





















Many people argue in favor of consoles by pulling the "exclusives" card. What they don't realize is, making that argument speaks entirely against consoles. In order to get the "exclusives" they always argue about(they often list things like Last of Us, Legend of Zelda, and RYSE nevermind, RYSE came to PC after Xbox One almost bankrupted Crytek), they would have to buy each and every console that those games belong to, bringing their budget well beyond $1,000. Even putting $500 into a PC will get you a system more powerful than each, with the full library of even the most demanding PC titles. PC has the most exclusives for a reason, though. Due to the healthy, open, and competitive PC market, independent developers tend to gravitate toward the PC. Console companies are generally hostile toward independent developers and not nearly as many can easily make their game available to console markets. With things like GOG, Steam, torrent sites (No, really! Indie developers and artists have used ThePirateBay for distribution on many occasions), and Desura, developers have millions of PC gamers they can reach without spending a single dime. To play every console exclusive, you would have to buy both consoles anyways (yes, the largest argument is 'console' exclusives not 'PlayStation' or 'XBox', just 'console)... which puts your price point over that of a PC. Not to mention, consoles are what trudged in and created the exclusivity issue in the first place, hoping that you'd reward them for it and buy into their cancerous ecosystem. In a situation where you have a choice of many, pick the best of the group: PC.
Here's what you can play on PC. Here's what you can only play on PC. Here's what you can play on PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox, Xbox 360, and XBox One. PC suddenly doesn't look so bad anymore!You can use any controller with your PC, not just one single model like with consoles





















First off, mouse and keyboard is the best possible input in terms of accuracy. PCs have so many possible input methods, I can't even count them all. You've got Leap Motion, controllers for PS3, XBox 360, SNES, NES, N64, wheels, joysticks, you name it. Console controllers are a close #2 in gamer preference on the PC. Some games (like Super Meat Boy) can actually be easier with a controller. You can plug a console controller right into your PC and be on your way. Very little configuration is needed, it just kind of works on its own after it's plugged in. This is a lot of fun when you use emulators for console titles. Isn't freedom of choice a beautiful thing?PC is the king of legacy game and software support





















Thanks to emulators and the raw power of modern PCs, you can run any game or application. See our guide to emulation! Your PC can run games from DOS, Mac OS, Commodore, NES, SNES, N64, PS1, PS2, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, XP, Vista, you name it. Emulators are also known to offer better control configuration (including support for any controller ) and graphical options that make it look better than its original platform. Games and applications from old-ish (1990+) PC operating systems will require a virtual machine or DOSBox. Old console games will require an emulator, which for the most part are free and open source. See this video  (6:00 - 7:40) from TekSyndicate for a more in-depth explanation. Here's the latest XBox 360 emulator progress  and here's the latest PS3 emulator progress.You can turn one PC into many and multiply its value by "terminalizing" it





















Before you even begin reading: this is a diagram of what it looks like . There are software solutions out there that can essentially add a terminal to your PC and allow a second user to play games or browse in parallel to whatever you're doing without even interrupting each other. All you need is a second keyboard, mouse, and display. You can turn your single PC into up to 6. SoftXPand is the only software I know of that can do this on Windows, however. For Linux, you have multiseat.With a capture card, you can pull video output from another PC or console into a display or window on your main PC





















PCs are capable of a lot, and they can save you a lot of money. One such popular method among PC gamers to access their console without buying a dedicated display is to just send their video into the PC and display it on one of their monitors. It saves power, money, and space.A PC can be used to donate spare computational power toward the betterment of mankind... or your wallet





















Seti@Home, Folding@Home, World Community Grid, and many others, are all a few of the many options you have available as a PC owner. All you do is install their clients, hit "Start" and relax. Whenever your PC isn't in use, it uses your otherwise idle CPU to perform small workloads and submit back to their larger projects. You can help cure cancer, find extraterrestrial life, assist in drug research, and many other things. Check out our folding team wiki page! This same compute power can be put toward Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin mining as well, earning thousands per year in some cases.PC gaming is strong and growing, and it's not going anywhere for the foreseeable future





















For those of you that worry about the possibility of jumping onto a dying horse, worry no more. The PC is profitable, stable and even growing (in some sectors) in market share every year. Not only is it growing worldwide, but the only areas it has left to win a majority gaming marketshare in is Canada, the US, and Mexico . So, if you want to go with what's the healthiest for you and the industry... go PC. The misinformation about PC "dying" is typically spewed by angry people that want to recruit others into the ecosystem that they decided was best (probably just because they were already trapped in it). Developers (the people who make the games that drove you to choose a platform in the first place) also prefer PC, because they don't lose half of their profits to manufacturing and exorbitant fees. Lastly and most importantly, gamers are switching back. Ultimately because the PC is cheaper, more open, customizable, easier to fix, and capable of so much more.Consoles are no longer the industry innovation leaders





















Back when the SNES/N64/PSX came out, it was a different time. Now, it may seem that consoles are to thank for graphical fidelity making leaps every eight years, but they're not. The reason gaming takes a leap forward every time a new generation of consoles come out is because they're what was holding it back in the first place. Think about it: 70% of the target audience of any given game will have to be playable on continuously aging console hardware. That means that the developers have to make sure that their game will run on said machines, with or without the features they desire. Many of their ideas and features they could have implemented are thrown out the window because the hardware simply can't handle it. As a result, the developers are forced to sell a stripped-down product. Of course, PC users will most often get a better product if the same title lands in their hands, but it's never exactly what the developer originally expected. In some rare cases, the PC port is terrible... but only because the developers are unable to allocate as much time and money to the PC branch of the project. There's a line they have to draw somewhere in between the capabilities of the console and the capabilities of the PC. A fine example of this would be Crysis, a game which launched on consoles four years after it was released on PC . There have been occasional instances where the developer will rebuild the game (graphically) from scratch to make sure that the PC version fulfills their vision, but even that is rare. So... the less people that are purchasing consoles, the less of a stranglehold Microsoft and Sony will have on the industry. The more people that are on PC, the more wiggle room the developers have to make their game the best it can be. If you enjoy seeing games get better, go with a PC.Hardware companies and game companies make more money from PCs than they do consoles





















Yes, it's true. Even at full price on a console, developers make more money from it being sold on Steam for 75% off. Why? Because developing for PC has no per-sale royalty fees, no development kit fees, no submission fees, and no cost of physically manufacturing/shipping/stocking their finished products. Your money goes straight to the developer's pocket, and the game directly onto your PC. Hardware makers earn much healthier margins on PC as well, since they aren't relying on eventual-profit-by-volume under some tremendously long-term supply contract for Microsoft or Sony. If you care about saving money for yourself , go with the PC. If you care about funding developers and keeping your favorite games flowing, go with the PC. If you care about the hardware companies like AMD and nVidia that make modern gaming possible, go with the PC. Once again, consoles exist only to suck money out of developers, hardware companies, and gamers. It's plain as day: Sony and Microsoft don't care about anything but money. If they really cared about improving the state of gaming, why are they sucking every possible entity dry at every possible stage of the process? Literally, for the love of gaming, go with a PC.Used game sales are more destructive to the industry than piracy and sales





















According to Lionhead studios, this is true. At least for them, anyways. It makes sense that this would affect all console developers equally, though. This won't be an issue much longer, however, because the console industry is beginning to restrict used game sales to the point where your physical game is more like a receipt than an actual game.
This isn't an attempt at silencing the piracy problem as a whole, because piracy is a problem... but: it's not just PC. All platforms suffer from it, even mobile! It's just important to remember, if you're going to try and attack piracy in the name of the developer, you should remember to attack used game sales just as much (if the real motive is to help developers, which in most cases it's really just an attempt to justify an attack on the PC platform).Piracy is actually more of a problem on consoles than it is on the PC





















There's a lot of undeserved misinformation flying around, usually sounding something like, "PC gamers are a bunch of pirates"/"PC isn't getting this game because they're all pirates"/"Developers did this or that because they're punishing them for being pirates". In reality, as concluded by Intel's research, the majority of piracy you see today takes place on consoles! The massive drop in piracy can likely be credited to easy, cheap, and even free distribution methods and services such as Good Old Games and Steam. Judging by Intel's research, it looks like the only people who really claim piracy is a massive problem on PC are the ones who are known for terrible DRM or hate it purely out of jealousy toward Valve (EA, Ubisoft).Most of the screenshots and gameplay you see on "next-gen" advertisements are actually from a PC





















See the image below? That's Microsoft XBox team themselves at a popular game convention using PCs to demonstrate how "good" the XBox One looks! If the XBox team themselves are incapable of convincing you that PC is superior, nothing will. Seeing as all console games are developed on PCs and then skimmed down for consoles, it's only natural that they use footage from the best-looking system to try and sell their product. Sony and Microsoft both know that the truth is far from pretty, so they source their media from a high-end PC rather than a console. They think you'll forget by the time you buy their system anyhow. They don't care about it actually looking good, they just expect you to forget by the time you pay them upwards of $500 for everything. The question is, will you let them?Console gamers are not the common enemy. Console gaming is.





















Sony and Microsoft give you an inferior system, charge you money for it, and make you hold on to the pieces of junk for 8 years before they give you the option of (measly) upgrades. By selling you these systems, they lock you into their overpriced ecosystem, helping them further the cycle with their ill-acquired money. When you take into account the business strategy of these companies, you'll find that it's all just one big greedy systematic ripoff of uneducated consumers. They're holding your favorite games hostage on their closed platforms because they know you'll buy into it. If everyone went with a PC and disregarded this disgusting behavior, these developers wouldn't be so easily convinced to support these "next-gen" consoles.. So, do yourself and the industry a favor and go with a PC. PC exists because it's an excellent platform and for no other reason than that. Nobody's advertising it. Nobody's cutting deals with Frito Lay to get it stamped on Doroto bags. Nobody's running a 'PC booth' at gaming festivals. PC exists and thrives simply because it is freaking glorious. XBox and PlayStation consoles exist because their parent corporations hijack developers (and games) that people love and cancel ports to competing platforms (other consoles as well as PC), and force fans of these games to pay a 'hardware ransom' to play it. The PC is open, cheap, customizable, and powerful. Your best interests are always at hand, no matter how arrogant some PC gamers may seem when they speak negatively of the "anti-gamer" consoles. For anyone that's offended, I am truly sorry... but if you're going to get offended over this guide then you probably had no intention of giving PC a chance in the first place. Just remember: PC gaming is superior to console gaming, but the gamers themselves are neither superior or inferior to one another: they're just people with varying degrees of understanding. Fight the misinformation, fight the false advertising, and fight the anti-gaming console monopoly. Long live freedom, long live affordable and beautiful gaming, and long live the Glorious PC Gaming Master Race!Notable LinksFurther reading at WikipediaAuthor's NoteSharing the guide with othersReader ResponseOther quotesOther language translationsTranslationsSpecial

And I think that I might just get sent to the pen

Vaporeon's hot, when she see me, she splash

I’d love leaving sooner, “Thoughts inside my head”, get
Loud out here in the sewer, loud out here on the west
Hit you right ‘bove the vest, hit you right, make a mess (Ba-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Slack jaw sitting on the couch, wackin' these niggas I'm hidden in crouch
Ouch, fire style with the sign, ninja put kunai inside of yo mind

I'ma hit shawty like fuck it, I body bag it and then quit it
Admit it, yo back raw, slack 

Name's Hank Hill, propaner insaner
Out the brainer, been known to snort the cocainer
And my dick's as long as a couple of toothpicks
And my asshole can only fit two dicks
Maybe three, if I eat some casserole
We could cram another into my fat asshole
I'm startin' to get burly, I'm a little bit lost
How much did the holla cost?
About six million, and I got a billion
'Cause I can do whatever I set my mind to
Except blow shit up with it, only when I'm not trying to
And all I want in life is a collection of lawn chairs
And some gummy bears
Throw in some gay sex like American History X
Like I'm Ed Norton, Pusha to the T
When I'm  some earthquake
Or maybe even a vanilla milkshake
Let's hear some Seinfeld bass and eat some toothpaste
Nothing about me is kind
Like trying to high-five the blind
Like if I was Mister Seacrest
Selling one-hundred-twenty-dollar hip-hop shirts
Like I was Kanye West
Like I'm always losing, like a-ha, honey
And there's nothing funny about the Easter Bunny
In the middle of July
Pinocchio knows and I just can't lie
You might also likeMaybe it's just my heritage
I want to grow up to be as fake as Lamar Odom's marriage is
While I stare at his sister-in-laws' carriages
While I spout out some ray-jays and shoot some AKs
'Cause it's the return of the P-double-O-N
We're as Bad as the Sin, that's a joke about the comedian
Somebody please stop feeding him
Why's it always sunny in Philly? Please fill me in, Charlie Day
But who knew Mac was gay?
But I'm all about pride, and I love kittens
So let's give him some little kitten mittens
While I'm spittin' like Walt Whitman
Like I'm on the toilet but I will not spoil it
Just watch season five
Shoot some heroin and listen to Dive
And the sky sure is blue
And if you asked me my favorite day of the week
I'd have to choose two
The two where I eat cheese pizza and chill with my crew
Always on the patrol for poon, play that pussy like a bassoon
And I'll eat your whole asshole, you'll go "holy mackerel"
When I come out lookin' like a raccoon
Except the mask is just your shit
And I'll apologize to your armpit
For foreseeing me sneezing in it, just spray some Febreze in it
And when I say I'm sorry know I meant it
And know that your gooch was splendid
That's the path between your cooch and your butt crack
And I know my compliments are wack
And I know my pick-up lines are wack
But you know you like the One Man Wolf Pack
That's what I call my ball sack
'Cause I've only got one teste
And if he was gay he'd slap his two besties
What happened when the cow's dad touched him?
He got moo-lested, just like your patience is getting tested
This song isn't even about pizza with cheese
He's just rapping about the birds and the bees
Ladies, be quiet, let me see your knees
And I'll blow you some kisses
And I won't stop until R. Kelly pisses me off
Like when old ladies say no, guess it just goes to show
I can blow low when I go low 'cause I'm so fucking good at limbo
Why's the pizza so aggressive, Jimbo?
I don't know, Sheen, I just don't know
What's your favorite medicine?
'Cause there's nothing better than
Me inside of your butt socks
I hope you're a fan of guys with two cocks
Remember when Poon Patrol was good fun?
Do you remember when I stuck my Donut Stick
Between your Honey Buns?
I want to get on a bike and fly away like I'm E.T
But I can't go outside 'cause the mailman beats me
Why? I don't know, it beats me, but he'll never defeat me
'Cause i've got the spirit of the dragon
Even if its balls are saggin'
And it's as old as Bob Saget and if I had a tail I'd wag it
And I'd fly really really really far away
Like some deranged half-boy half-dog faggot
And I'd live off the maggots of maggots
Hey do you have any matches? Yeah, sure
Oh no, I'm on fire, I worked for months on these m-m-mustaches
Where's Keanu Reeves when you need him?
Where're the stars when you see them?
Did Nemo's dad really beat him?
Leave it up to the lucky fin, like Barbie and Ken
I'm always askin' myself, when's this verse gonna end?
When my wiener's gonna bend
Far enough back to my butthole
My what hole? Into my motherfuckin' butthole
Shout out, shout out to myself, for that verse
God damn! God damn! God damn! 
Damn, that verse!
Such a good verse, man!
Thanks
Uh, this is recorded right now, in the present
Some people say I live in America
I just live in the moment
I'm sorry that-- if a lot of those bars were offbeat
I'm only mediocre at rapping sometimes
Thank you for listening to Poon Patrol 2
I hope you enjoyed it
This song, uh, also contains a Michael Jackson sample
But, uh, you can't fuckin' sue me, you're dead

*glass breaks*
Oh fuck! He shot the radio! Shit! Stay calm! We need to stay calm if we have hope to elude this Dog the Bounty Hunter-looking motherfucker. Oh shit!
Where's the money, shit-turd?
Fuck, why is he doing this?
You mean you don't remember?
Flashback, boy...
*flashback beginning sound effect*
Adam Sandler was born with a curious condition. If he doesn't NUT at least once every week, he'll fucking die. Adam Sandler has to learn that sometimes, love can be found in the most unexpected places. Do you believe in miracles?
Adam Sandler lives in NYC, it's the place to be
He's got a beautiful wife that he would give his life for
And he's got a fine-ass dog
Adam catches his wife cheating
How will he achieve his weekly skeeting?
Every now and then something magical happens
Do you believe?
Adam Sandler loves his dog
And Adam Sandler hates his wife
And the weekend is comin' up
And Adam wants to keep his life
Adam Sandler's living in a house with two bitches
And he's gotta make a choice, yeah, he's gotta make a choice
Every now and then something magical happens
Do you believe?
Adam Sandler Fucks a Dog
Adam Sandler Fucks a Dog
Do you believe in miracles?
Coming April 20th, 2069
Two thousand and...four-twenty
Wow, I'm really enjoying Sandler's performance
I can't believe we made the best movie ever made
Wow. This is great
Oh shit! We lost the entire movie budget when that dog sued us!
How are we going to pay Adam Sandler?
Don't worry about it. I got this Dog the Bounty Hunter-looking motherfucker to pop a cap in that weak-ass Adam Sandler before he can do anything. His ass will be cheese in a fucking cheese grater, we're gonna fucking... we got that guy to kill him and, uh, he's pretty much dead at this point so, uh, that way, we won't have to pay that damn-ass Jew boy Adam Sandler a dime
How are we going to pay the bounty hunter?
Uh...
*knocking*
Where's the money, poop-shit?
Oh shit! We're so fucked!
Oh jeez, we're really fucked!
We just can't believe how fucked we are!
*knocking*
Someone's knocking on the other door!
It's me, Jerry Seinfeld!
I'm here to rescue you guys, so we have to go quickly, come on!
*flashback ending sound effect*
Thanks, Seinfeld!
I'm gonna pull over, I gotta whiz. You guys must be wondering why I saved you. Well you see, I can't take this shit-for-brains PC culture. I can't take it! You guys are the world's only chance against it!
Ahhh!
*gunshot*
Where's the money, shit-turd?
Oh shit, he's back! He killed Seinfeld!
*tires screeching*
Haha, that was crazy
You wanna light a fat one and turn on the backup radio?
Yeah, boy...
Hey, man, you're listening to Poon Patrol Radio
We out here...
Hey, man, what's up, you ever do the shooby-dooby?
No, man, I ain't into that stuff, man, I don't do that stuff
Man, you gotta do the shooby-dooby. You know, man?
You just gotta, you know
I don't know, man...I ain't gonna do the shooby-dooby, man
Man...
Yo, man...
Who you think you talkin' to or somethin' man?
I ain't got that...
Are you ready to die, motherfuckers?
I'm a cyborg, I got robot feet
You wanna get high, got JPEGs and weed
JPEGS and drinks, JPEGS and leaves
And if you want a hard drive you can suck on these nuts
I slap robot butts, I fuck the pussy up in the hacker guts
Fucking QWERTY keyboards, stick 'em in my USB port
I'm a fuckin' cyborg, I'm not a fuckin' robot
So yeah, I can still smoke pot
If the economy's nugs let me chill with some mugs
To smoke drugs and get hugs
Because man, life's just one big fuck
Get the fuck out of here, robot man
Let a real man show you how it's done
(Ahh, don't do that, oh no)
Fuck you. Fuck you, robot
I'm a naked old man, I'm a naked old man
I'm a naked old man, I'm a naked old man
I'm a naked old man, I'm a naked old man

I'm an old man, I am naked, I'm an old man, I am naked
I'm an old man, I am naked, I'm an old man, I am naked
All I want to do is dance (Yeah, boy...)
Take off both my shoes and pants
Throw my shirt right out the door
Underwear across the floor
I still got socks on, I still got socks on
I still got socks on, I still got socks on
I still got socks on, I still got socks on
I still got socks on, I still got socks on
I'm an old man, I am naked, I'm an old man, I am naked

I'm a naked old man, I'm a naked old man
I'm a naked old man, I'm a naked old man
We are here to mourn the loss of Jerry Seinfeld. He was funny, I guess. Let us have a moment of silence
Oh man, I can't believe Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler, and Poon Patrol died all in the same week
Shut the fuck up, man! I mean, what the fuck? (I'm sorry) You're at a fucking funeral. Is is that hard to be quiet for three goddamn seconds? I just now said "let's have a moment of silence," you...you dirty sand rat!
*booing*
Oh yeah, whatever, fuck you! Everyone's thinking it!
What the fuck, man? You're telling me you don't have Frosties right now? You don't have Frosties, despite Frosties still being on the sign? I want a Frosty. I want a Frosty, I need one now, give me one! If you do not have a Frosty, I will take my business elsewhere, fuck you! Fuck you!
My name is Agent Pubes. My name is Agent Pubes, I hail from the heart of Jamaica. Jamaica, man! From my childhood, I remember, I remember the yam fields, for miles, man. But now, my life is in ruins because Poon Patrol is dead. Poon Patrol is dead! My whole life I have aspired to bring these men to justice and now they are sailing down the river of yams with the Jamaican Death Lord. And I am here, not with Frosty. I am here with my pain, with my sorrows. And I-- Oh no! Fuck! Oh man...
*ringtone*
I am getting a phone call. Hello? What? What? What?! WHAT?! What are you saying? Are you telling me that Poon Patrol lives?!
Poon Patrol lives!
Ohhhhhh!
Oh! Oh ho ho!
Ohhhhhh!
Ohhhhhh!
It is a good day for Agent Pubes

Hello, I would like to buy this radio
All right, man, that'll be $4.20
Oh shit, could it be? Are you guys Poon Patrol?
I thought you guys died in America twenty-two years ago
Yo, dude, give me a fresh beat, this guy's got us figured out!
Yeah, boy...
I've been living in India for twenty-two years
Been living in India with twenty-two deers
Been out in India working at Sears
Been out in India making fun of queers
Been out in India making lots of friends
Been out in India making lots of tens
Been out in India meeting lots of hens
Been out in India making friends with twins
I've been living in India for twenty-two years
Been living in India with twenty-two deers
Been out in India working at Sears
Been out in India making fun of queers
Been out in India making lots of friends
Been out in India making lots of tens
Been out in India meeting lots of hens
Been out in India making friends with twins
Y'all motherfuckers thought I died
But I've just been living here in India
Y'all motherfuckers thought I died
But I've just been living here in India
I've been living in India for twenty-two years
Been living in India with twenty-two deers
Been out in India working at Sears
Been out in India making fun of queers
Y'all motherfuckers thought I died

Y'all motherfuckers thought I died
But I've just been living here in India
Hey man, can I just get my radio? I have somewhere to be
Fuck off, man, buy your own damn radio! We're on break
Turn on that radio
Shouts-out to Kush K, money, Glenn Liar
Shouts-out to our lawyer, shouts-out to Lil' Shmegma
Shouts-out to Saucy Boy, shouts-out to Meme Hound
You know I'm gonna shout-out Sweet Dad
You know I'm gonna shout-out Stinky Leg
Dogberry, A.A. Bonzai, Horn Dog Mom
You know I'm gonna shout-out Mom Daddy
Look to our left to see our first exhibit
Imagine how each and every one of 'em fuckin' fidgets
Just corny motherfuckers scopin' out these bitches
Catch me wrong and become a narrative to the digit
Send it quick to the wack MC obituary
Diss me on wax and I've leave flowers at your cemetery
Very scary
Like lettin' you live with ripped-off eyelids
Pretty bitch pissin' on your grave just like I did
Rap game Gapalagos 'cause of my own eye lint
Cracker MCs 'round the block but you can't find 'em
Tell Macklemore and G-Eazy that, bitch, I'm right behind 'em
Leave a message, tell the blood splatter not to mind 'em
Remains of the bodies in the sewer where nobody else can find 'em
I'm hiding in the mall on LSD thinking that I'm Gandhi
Bustin' nuts in the bathroom stalls
Some chick reminds me of Yolandi
'Cause she got the bangs and the eyes
When I go bang-bang I'm always in disguise
Leave my brand in the game like the backs of cattle
Lookin for trouble? You 'bout to get a drastic battle
You on a high horse, but you ain't got no saddle?
Bitch, I am the shit, all you do is fuckin' dabble
Can't touch me like you the fuckin' pastor
You six feet underground and I'm like the lights at fuckin' NASA
Up in space jerking off the plasma
Foreshadow my demise, always look me in the eyes
Unless you a sucka mothafucka tryin' to get splat
Blow twenty-one cap through your fuckin' Yankees hat
If you really think Poon Patrol ain't all that
Stay the fuck back, stay the fuck back
Son! You must defeat Poon Patrol or the bad man will come and get you! The bad man will come in your sleep and do very bad things! He will touch you! The bad man will touch you!
*sirens*
Fuck! The cops! It's the cops!
Don't worry, I can handle these guys
Do you know why I pulled you over, sir?
Uh, what?
You're under arrest for trying to arrest a fucking cop
You're a cop?
Yeah
Uh, that's funny, because you guys look a lot like that Poon Patrol fucker that hired a hitman to kill that Adam Sandler Jew boy, and then escaped to India without a visa
Oh man, that is funny, well it's a good thing I'm just a cop
*gun cocks*
All right, get in the fucking car boys
Uh, yes sir (All right, dude)
Shotgun!
Oh shit!
*taser zapping*
Ahhh! Ooh, they got the, the electric...mm, they got the electric fat boys in me. Fuck! Fuck! It doesn't have to be like this! I just wanted the passenger seat! Ohh...
No, get in the fucking trunk, kids
Oh man, I just got slammed into a trunk
It is me again, Agent Pubes. This time, I am in India. I am seeing the elephants walking around. I am seeing the brown folk on their bikes. The plans are in motion. Poon Patrol will fall to their knees in disgrace. And I will shout out to Buddha, and I will say, "It is me, Agent Pubes, defeater of Poon Patrol!" My mother would be proud, in... in heaven, in the yam fields. I love you, Mama! Mama! I love you! Mama Pubes!
*ringtone*
Oh man, I am getting a phone call. What? What about the test results? What are you saying? You say I'm not Jamaican? You say I have dick cancer? Nooooooo! Are you telling me that I do really have that cancer in my balls? You say I have less than forty minutes to live? You say that if Poon Patrol does not die by the end of this shitty song, that I will die? No! Mama! Mama Pubes! I can do it! Poon Patrol, hear my cry! You will... fucking die! It's gonna be so metal when I fucking break your bones! When I smash your head in with my Jamaican hammer! It is no problem at all, sir. Thank you for your call
Haha. I may have dick cancer, but those Poon Patrol fags will have... dead... cancer, when I, when my plans are done. They, they have a few old friends coming their way, I think
Ha! Oh ho ho! Agent Pubes will win again!
Oh, livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison
Livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison
Livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison
Livin' in the prison, livin' in the prison
Livin' in the prison--
Hey, what the fuck is that sound?
What is that sound, man? Oh shit!
*explosion*
Oh shit!
It's me, indie sensation Car Seat Headrest. I'm here to rescue you guys. Quickly, get on my private fucking jet
*jet takeoff*
Thank God you guys are safe. Welcome to my private jet. I got it using the money I made when I sold the fuck out!
Where are we headed?
We're headed to my fucking private launch pad in China
Yeah!
Haha! We're gonna party in space! Uh, just us cool dudes. We're all really cool. It'll be a while before we get there, though. We've got drinks, I think there's a movie on
Oh man, it's almost midnight. I guess I'd better fuck that dog
Here I go...
*dog yipes*
Adam! It's not what it looks like!
Aw, you bitch! I wanted to fuck the dog and now you're fuckin' the dog! I'm outta here
Adam!
Oh man, I guess I, uh, I better get used to dyin' real quick...
*frog ribbiting*
Oh, is this-- that's a frog! Uh, I guess the movie's really called "Adam Sandler Fricks a Frog." Haha! That's pretty funny! That's pretty...oh man, I gotta, I gotta fuck this frog, I gotta nut in the frog. Here I go!
*ribbiting intensifies*
Oh!
This shit sucks, famiry
Turn on that radio, that motherfuckin' radio, fam

You are listening to DJ Ching Chong
Get ready for some crazy shit
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Still no contest, even if I was half a man
In fact, I sorta feel like it, your majesty
Holdin' these truths to be self-evident
Watchin' the doubtful become irrelevant
Life's so iced-out, feel like a shaman
Pockets still sag so I still eat ramen
Life's so iced-out, feel like a shaman
Pockets still sag so I still eat ramen
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Ten tabs of acid when I'm trippin' in my casket
Lime-green vest when I'm creepin' out the attic
You know who the fuck it is, that good kush activist
Bustin' out the package, bitch
Wonderin' where all the loud-ass cabbage is
Couple mushroom caps to the dome
In the year 3000, everything is chrome
I'm that nasty man doing fuckin' aerobics
Fuck with me and your whole gang gets toasted
3:17 in the fuckin' afternoon
Add one hour, three minutes, 4:20 bitch
I'mma smoke that weed, I'mma chase that high
'Cause I'm the finest bitch fuckin' alive
You more like a bee, bitch, stay in your hive
Spray you with my official swag repellent
Will I slice you open? Bitch, there ain't no tellin'
Might fuck around, kill the fuckin' bee
Can't catch my rain when I motherfuckin' sleep
Your girl keep the umbrella for my fuckin' skeet
But there ain't no clouds when I'm out
Never a shortage, never a drought
When I toke that dope in the baggy
Beans on the block, pockets get saggy
You know I smoke that good, shawty know I keep that wood
I add weight to the game like cinder blocks
The day I'm out is the day there's a crack in this rock
Step up to the block like, "What's good, officer, like, no
I ain't got no fuckin' weed up in my socks
I ain't have any weed up in my socks"
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
Two stoned eyes and a positive-ass shirt
Sippin' on that shit like a plant in the dirt
My son, Agent Pubes! Before I die, you must do it!
You must kill them! You must stab them!
You must defeat Poon Patrol!
Eatin' pussy all day long
I was eatin' pussy when I wrote this song
Been running through these hoes like we're running out of hoes
And I'm suckin' off my bros like we're running out of bros
And I'm gonna smoke some weed and hit that blunt
Hold up, shawty, let me hit it from the front
And I'm gonna suck that dick and hit that sack
Hold up, bro, let me hit it from the back
And I'll kiss your mom on her mouth
And I'll kiss your dad down south
Suck my dad's dick like I didn't come from it
And I'll eat his ass like he doesn't shit from it
Oh, man, this beat is oriental
And eatin' pussy is quintessential
All my clothes are hand-me-downs
Because I like to keep the jeans in the family
And I only like to fuck my family
Because I like to keep the genes in the family
I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life
I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life
I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life
I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life
Cyber pussy in my veins
Digital dickery in my brains
All you gotta say to get into these shorts
Is "hey, what's up," I throw my nuts up
I fuck your butt up, I fuck it down
Eating pussy like a pussy-eating clown
And if you don't associate with these sorts
My dick will distort you, like Sandler distorts Jews
I was born hard, when I go to hell, because I am a freak
I'll probably enjoy it, because I am a freak
Of course it's theoretical
Unlike the way I wreck your genitals
Sandy Hook was a tragedy, it was fucked up
But shut up, shawty, gotta hit it from the front
Gettin' my nut!
I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life
I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life
I'm eating pussy like there's no more time in my life
I'm suckin' dick like there's no more time in my life
Yeah, the beat goes hard, like suckin' dudes' dicks
'Cause it ain't against the law
What? Sorry, shawty, I guess I let my tongue fuckin' slip
Yeah, I mix the crack in my Fun Dip
Yeah, I've got a fun clique, all we do is smoke zips
Pop zits, and fuck clits
When I'm getting my nut off
Wondering if R. Kelly's butt's soft
While I'm sliding in
Wondering when Dennis Rodman's gonna come riding in
 diving in, or some rimjob poon
Yeah, I've fucking slewn all that fucking poon
Yeah, I play fucking bassoon because I'm in a fucking cocoon
I'm a raccoon eating on some poon
I fuck your girl butt naked with my harpoon, and my bassoon

Stop bein' a dick, Scott!
Konnichiwa, we have arrived in China
Just in time, the rocket's about to launch. Come on, boys!
Rocket launch in five...four...three...two...
Rise if you would...
Yo, I step up to the mic, I hit that fuckin' weed
Is it recording?
Yeah
Shit...
We'll be entering deep space in six, nine... haha!
Oh, man...

I'm complacent in my own spaceship
Told the age-old never to weigh shit
On some underpaid arcade chips
Calm, collecting karma sauce and in the splatter
Vacant crime scene, snuck a shook look
From the neck to the bladder
Young hearts ain't the only ones who shatter
Pacin' spaceship on the beat, never wear no Asics on my feet
Adidas on the street, like Peter countin' sheep
Always kept the nine on his blanket
After twelve is when he would get paintin'
White walls on those dark rows
May  to get that shark's gold
Warm shoulders get cold
Always leapt for the stars, now I think my asteroid's got mold
Like microwave dinner that ain't get sold
Keep ninety-five beehives in my wallet
Don't, dangerous, what I call it?
Whose life, and how much it costin'?
New house, codeine out the faucet
No furniture, new chick dick curvature
This sick shit like it's Bad Motherfucker Overture
New whip slips over curves, my hand dips over hers
My feet off the pedal, we flyin' heavy metal
New vibrato, top model, love module
No stem, told me I got you, laser tag I shot you
Daffy Duck do-rag when Poppy pops you
You're blowin' dandelions if you really think I'mma spot you
Yo teach, remember me? All the classes I was failing in?
Now I'm on a space beach, tokin' with the aliens
The nebulous strain, zero G's on the brain
Fuck the President, my residence in Sector Pain, Quadrant 69
I've always wanted to fuck a star
Get my asteroids off while I'm spittin' space bars
The Wi-Fi sucks but the view's not bad
I'm entering Uranus while I dab
In space there's nothin' to hold me down
Nothin' to restrain me from unleashin' on these clowns
I might have Down's (Bitch, what the fuck?)
I seriously might have Down's. Space Down's
No license, backseat, flip phone buzzin'
No brakes until the 5-0 fuckin' fuzzin'
God's trek, belongs full of God's breath, God's chest
Drippin' judgment, best bet, mullet, suit, bulletproof
Vest stain on some stinky ass breath
Roomba rollin' 'round the graveyard, bumpin' Cyndi Lauper
While I'm in Qatar, bump her caboose
Now I'm feelin loose, alligator
Forged full of lies like paperback newspaper
 with the friendly saber-tooth liger
Get your daughter and hide her
In a cell, only her and a fuckin' tiger
Ask her about her vices
You're life's about as dense as a bowl of fuckin' rice is
Space is nice, shiz, nothin' to do but burn bowls
Finally, a location to reflect my soul
Ooh! Ooooh! Having-- I'm having fun on this spaceship. Space is big. Man, it's big. So anyway, Car Seat Fuckshit, why'd you bring us up here in space on your big spaceship?
So I could kill you. Haha
What?! What?! What?
I'd say my plan is sick
I'll tell you because you're ready for this Car Seat Dick
When I heard you were alive I was filled with fear
Another Poon Patrol album would end my career
I was looking for some indie clothes in Indian Sears
When I saw the two cashiers comin' from the rear
Now I knew that if I killed you then and there I'd go to jail
But if I took you to out space then the plan could never fail
Aliens don't have laws (Aliens don't use laws)
Now I knew that two dank fellows half as cool as you guys
Wouldn't cross the border with a fucker such as I
So I called the cops on you so that I could pull a bust
The only way for me to seem dank enough to trust
So I could take you out to China and shoot us into space
Somewhere with the privacy to take my place in history
Like John Wilkes Booth with an indie affectation
I'm a quirky god, I'm an internet sensation (Sensation)
Internet sensation (Sensation)
Sensation (Sensation)
Sensation (Sensation)
The only internet sensation
Uh, get ready to die, motherfuckers! Here I go!
*gunshots*
Bam! Bam! Oh!
Oh shit! It's Adam Sandler!
Yeah, I'm that Sandler
Thanks for saving us, Adam Sandler! It's really good to see you!
Cut the shit man, get the F out of my face
It's time for bars, time to put you in your place
You think I came to help you make a shifty Jew escape
But I came to blow your brains out and then shoot you into space
Been twenty-two years since your hitman shot me
The damage was so critical that now I've got robot feet
Nobody wants to see a movie featuring a freak
I was homeless in the street, I was eating rats for weeks
One day I got a call from my manager, Pubes
Told me Poon Patrol was still kickin', still smokin' doobs
I was pleased, even though at the time, I was pissing
From a man in the shitter to a man with a mission
Saw you gettin' on the rocket so I hid inside the cargo
I had a lot of time, so I popped in Fargo
Car Seat Head-Ass got no game
He slay pee-pee, bitch, no way
When your follicles all fall to fossil, leagues beneath the sand
Everything you are will disappear beneath my funny hand
I'm a silly man, with a fucked-up plan, stop me if you can
I'll fill Netflix with movies called The World's Chinkest Man
By Adam Sandler, maybe one will even have a star
Maybe you'll be a star too
When I throw you out the airlock and move to the moon
Lotsa time to contemplate the time
I took the lives of Poon Patrol
In my vortex psyche I will seal control
Basking in the glory of the kill!
Car Seat Fuckshit, stupid plan's unfulfilled
As he died, wishing he could do the things to you that I will
You'll never be half the meme that I am, bitch!
You're along the lines of the Kool-Aid pitcher dude
Or the Pink Panther. I'm still Adam Sandler
I'm Adam Sandler, motherfuckers!
Get ready to die! Here I go, haha!
You guys are fucked! (Hey, man, I'm thinkin' we hit that self-destruct button and get in the escape pod)
I'm about to do it! (Yeah, boy!)
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo, whoo... What?! WHAT?! NOOO!!
*explosion*
Oh shit, we killed Adam Sandler. Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! Oh man!
What can I say about Adam Sandler?
He was in movies. He did make jokes
Waterboy? Little Man? Big Dad, Eight Crazy Nights?
Grown Ups 2? Paul Blart, Mall Cop?
They're all movies
They're all movies. Fuck!
He should be called Adam Sandman!
Dude, if I'm being honest, like, fuck that dude. I'm so glad we got that motherfucker off of us. Like...seriously
Adam Sandler? That-- You're glad we killed him?
Yep
Dude, I feel the same way
Fuck that guy
Fuck him, dude. He was trying to kill us
Yeah, we killed that guy
We killed the funniest, the most unfunny man...
Really bad at rapping
Not a funny guy. But we murdered him
Fuck Adam Sandler
Yeah, fuck him
You know, I say, we go out...
 a bandana, maybe a scarf...
We go down to the flea circus...
Dude, this escape pod is heading straight for the sun
Oh fuck!

Dying doesn't feel as bad when you're famous
And you've got four cars and your fortune, gold bars, son
Counting up the profits on your way to stardom
I'll probably make it in the Guiness
With Ratatouille as witness
If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?
Will the world know how baller I fucked around?
If you want to be famous like me
But you can't do shit but smoke weed
Just kill yourself and get on TV (420 blaze it)
Or be a genius with great genes
Pumpin' out ten ten-out-of-ten mixtapes popped up on lean
Do one or the other but I've got both covered
Postmortem platinum, big shot to the maximum, yes
Death is nothing, really, when you're walking on the silly side
Death is a basic bitch, when you made this based shit
And you're smokin' that laced shit
Everyone's gotta go, I guess I'm just a guest in limbo
Shaggy and Scooby, tryin' to crack the mystery
Of what's livin' within this Dominican doobie
Life is a fad, at least I had an aesthetic
Everything is easy when you've got an aesthetic
Mind games, I'm hooked on ironic brand names
And when I was twelve, I beat Through the Fire and Flames
So I got that going for me
Too bad I couldn't die alone at forty
Damn, we must be breakin' the speed limit
Space cops wishin' we survived to pay the ticket
But dopamine is infinite and dying doesn't feel that bad
Dying doesn't feel that bad
Outer space ship spray LSD laced mace clit, pause, bitch!
Bust a nut, put my dick in the peanut butt-er, asteroid clutter
Wastin' afternoon, fuckin' jacking off to Flubber
Cum on my coattail, in a Chevy motel
Fake plastic trees, and a plain white tee
Nothin' on TV, no reachable signal
Fuck Ween, drink more fuckin' Pepto-Bismol
Deer skin cape, listenin' to Drake
Pretendin' I listen to Drake, bitch, I don't listen to Drake
Who are we? A couple shits who's playin' in the kudzu
Bitch, if you are a bubble then I did not mean to bust you
'Cause if you're yelling "fuck me" and I'm screaming "fuck you"
If you're actin'  I might just have to dunk you
Sorry, it's really hard to trust you
How you think I got in this fuckin' spaceship?
Are you even there? Think I'm going apeshit
Staring at the wall of this aluminum ball
Hallucination, illumination, etch in my eyelid
You didn't get as fucked up as I did
Headin' for the sun, ready for the run of this life
The thrill of the scene to absorb with the rainbow beams
I'm more than a meme, I'm not ready to leave
I'm not ready to die
Leavin' behind shawties from bamboo to Cancun
Goodbye to Wisconsin, goodbye to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
Hello to the sun's magnificent flames
Dougied with Satan and learned we had the same names
Yuh, he told me to tell the few still hatin'
That I been spittin' bars since Lindsay Lohan
And the pipe were fuckin' datin'
I'm another planet's favorite star
Catch me with some intergalactic space ghouls
Givin' away permanent vacations to these second-place fools
Just saw a mouse on a dirty satellite
Fuck the game butt-naked, in the candlelight
You all a bunch of clones like "hoy minoy minoy"
Drown you with drones, you stay sleepin' with the koi
Bitch, what the fuck? Get the fuck out of my face with that four-dimensional arcade bullshit. Fuck you
Dude, it sucks that we're dying. But, you know, at the end of the day, I'm glad that I was one of the three members of Poon Patrol
Yeah (Yeah)
Oh man, it's been such a pleasure bein' part of Poon Patrol. Man, I remember bein' down back at the Chinese liquor store. Man, man, I remember that Jew boy, Adam Sandler. It's been a real pleasure workin' with Poon Patrol
Thank you, Egg Boy! You are a very great friend!
Haha, ha! What are you guys talkin' about?
Yeah, boy!
Time dilation, final breath (Sunshine)
Ego inflation, ego death (Sunshine)
Poon Patrol in the sky
Goodbye
Said look at me, now, now, look at you
Split myself in half just to split myself in two
Don't know what to do, good sweet death, guess that's my cue
Catch you back in a few, bust a nut in her tooth
Right before I leave the earth, eat her ass, eat the dirt
Put on her skirt, then I fuckin' skrt
In the last callous, in my metallic palace
Closer to the spicy-ass sun
Hand on my gun, point it at the sun
Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang
Point it at the sun, let it go bang
Let it go bang bang, let it go bang
Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang
Point it at the sun, let it go bang
Let it go bang bang, let it go bang
No exception, death fucks us all, always answers the call
I'm a good catch, erection past his motherfuckin' balls
He lifts up his scythe as I lay down the motherfuckin' mic
Catch you on the flip side, motherfuckers!
Let it go bang, let it go bang bang, let it go bang
Point it at the sun, let it go bang
Let it go bang bang, let it go bang
Ahh, ow, ouch! Aaah! I'm on fire! Ouch! I'm on fire, bitch! I'm on fire, bitch! Aaaah! It's hot! Bitch, it's hot! I'm on fire! That's spicy! Oh shit! Oh, that's spicy! Aaaah! I'm a man and I'm on fire, bitch! I'm on fire! Ow, the flames!

Once again, the day is saved by Agent Pubes. My doctor does tell me that I only have two minutes to live, but I do not care. I do not care. Poon Patrol is dead and I can die content and join my mother in the yam fields of Jamaican Heaven. Oh yes, now I can die. Here I go. Here I go! Time to die! Time to f...time to die
*ringtone*
Oh, what is this? I am getting a phone call
Hello?
What the fuck, man?! What the fuck, 

B. Dot sits down with JayBlack and D.I. Da Hennyman at the URL Face-Offs the night before the battle to talk some shit. JC… Read More 
So you wanted Lux, lil' nigga! Woooow!
You was reachin' for God, then they passed you me
Blasphemy
No Loaded
I should've came suited for the kill
Nah, to keep it real, all I need is a casual tee for this casualty
I've been gunnin' at you, Julian
The first couple shots missed, bad accuracy
But the third round hit, SMACK outta nowhere, Traffic 3
I'm just glad to be, in ya presence
We done heard the tallest tales about the smallest legend
Y'all think he a murderer
But to me, when a nigga lack conviction  a legend
You a fraud, I said it
Cause real shooters come off the hip quick
One motion, the energy is all kinetic
In everyone of yo' gun bars you starin' down the pistol
And pause for seconds, but what, is the arm electric?
Like why you always in shock every time you palm the Wesson?
This is God's perception
And yo' bars is...random, what an odd selection
When a nigga good at shootin' shots, but then got a prob' directin'
And y'all waitin' for rounds that he drop in his game to line up that we never saw connectin'
Is this all you sketchin'?
With an illustration that it all impressive
Yeah, you got a pen, so (pencil)? What that mean to a nigga that real draw the weapon?
We gon' trace this back to where we first saw progression
Back when bein' gangsta wasn't dawg profession
Used to stay dancin', and now you got all these guns
The K clappin'
Well that motion went from one arm to the next
And I guess that's how ya wave happen
Look I ain't askin'
I got ya future in my hands like I'm palm readin'
You get to runnin', I get to gunnin', let the long reach him
A chrome pop, the dome shot, the robot, y'all like, "What the god meanin'?"
That mean I let the fifth fly and catch him mid stride, left his body stiff, but had his arms swingin'
This is bar season
I've had games versus lames that didn't write well
And well I'm here to write wit' a nigga I compare to
Aye Smack I'm finna Strike
Not like these other niggas, I didn't mean to scare you
I'm finna strike, I'm in the URL, bowling for pins (pens) and JC, I won't spare you
I got clear view, the way I see murder (C-Murder), it ain't No Limit to me airin' you wit' the strap
But I'd rather get your railroaded
The agony of ya screams will be music to my ears, and here's the Shocker, you always sound terrible on a track
This is facts, and dawg (dog), for all that malpractice another vet' is gettin' killed
You said you was the greatest in the world!
Now you runnin' out of space your circle gettin' cropped, they done put an alien in the field
Yeah,  you got drive, but you in a vehicle, you ain't registered to wheel
They put a bait car, on ya road to Lux and you ain't even notice  you got set up for the steal
This the build, I'm a rise and I'm catchin' you while you sinkin'
Nigga I'm it, you should've known you gettin' tagged, you catchin' me while I'm peakin', I'm leakin'
All the info on why you excel
Cause you stole Anubiis whole style, just slowed it down but I must admit you do this well
Let the truth prevail
And leave it to me to be the nigga that see through the veil
I figured you'd disagree, so I brought the hammer
For ya teeth so we can argue this tooth and nail
Nigga, you can tell, when a nigga whole demeanor foul
But he still wanna be seen as pals
That's JC, after every verse, it's "Aye, aye, good shit, my nigga." Handshake with a cheesy smile
You friendly-ass nigga, don't you see how that comradery don't appease the crowd?
BAOW! And before I shoot again, I add an attachment to the end
Just like him, I'm extending the arm in between the rounds
Can't y'all see he foul?
Tryin' to direct the crowd by slowin' down?
I know ya style, but colder, pal
I pull out and aim, left and right wit' the .40 cal'
Had the whole buildin' duckin', up and down, doin' the wave, nigga that's how I control the crowd
Can't believe this clown, and all the shit y'all let him get away with
Y'all know he don't spray clips, that's why he emphasis every line, every line
And y'all pay him for that over compensation
Yeah he write it well, but may as well write in braille
Peep the explanation
He always tryin' to bump it up a notch just so we can feel when you say shit
That's basic
But the Ike Turner-Annie Mae (anime) shit? Amazin'!
But pay attention, listen
It's all kinda contradictions of the statement
I mean this character you created? Is only based off the pen
So (pencil) whatever you draw up is the writtens we engage wit'
But without the notebook you get no look
Just a bunch of still shots of your colorful imagination
That's anime shit (animation)
When a nigga picks are (Pixar) only put in motion when we flippin' through the pages
I am dangerous!
And after this, you won't get booked a lot
I'm here to jooks ya spot
Where I'm from, they don't criticize the form - blaow!
They like, "Blood why you shoot him?" - they criticize why we even took the shot!
You get hooked and dropped, and if it ain't a fist fight, then you better shoot first
Or they gon' think you Verb, the way you standin' across from a long-ass clip, shit spittin' longer than a Mook third
Suwoop's heard, worldwide, I got all the red rags ridin' wit' me
So when I talk about P card, it ain't got nothin' to do with a Survivor Series
We united clearly
Where I'm from, all the Pirus is politickin' with the Locs
Cause this is the west and he mid, so y'all should've known it was different smoke
I approach, Smack like, "What the fuck you give me Carter for (4)?"
I can't believe this shit, I shoot him in the chest, {deep breath} he tryin' to catch his breath {deep breath}, can't breathe and shit
Then his knees is bent
This ain't gonna to work (Twork) out for you Julian
{Twork voice} My grievances!
When Wheezy drop, y'all gon' know it was me, Baby: I finally released the fif' (5)!
I'm a beast with this
And this that black African power
And if these is ya last days, Julian, this is yo' last hour
You might also like
Yo!
What's poppin', Beloved Dot?
This is not no fuckin' lecture, this will not be an opportunity for us to lead us wrong
But to each his own
All though this would be level playin' field, this is not an opportunity to play in field, I swing for home
As far as this...Loaded...rapid-fire style you got
Well, it's kind of a weapon, just not for protection
What y'all think is more useful in this line of profession?
B. Dot with his lessons or a dot on a Wesson?
Class in session!
You line 'em up, I'll pile 'em up
There's too many sides to B. Dot
Well whether or not he leave conscious, we gon' see a lot of Blood
There's too many sides
I embody what actually makes us unique: writin'
I mean, me slackin' that never been the truth
Whether it's slaving like Levar Burton, or drummin' like Questlove, I represent The Roots
And you a victim of it
I'm just waitin' on a day he face it
He can't replace it
I aim and blaze it
I  would say it would leave him hangin' like Michael Jackson, baby, but that'd be a Blanket statement
They brought you here cause you finish, ain't no debatin'
We already got Lux, and his pro creation is no replacement
Even at soul, that close to basic
Y'all know them games y'all can just beat whenever you want to?
Exactly, ain't no point in savin'
And I'm the reaper
My pistol licensed, ain't no need to keep my shit low
My camp right in the streets like Skid Row
Don't switch flows, play that part for real, guard ya grill
Cause that art to kill, follows you when you wake up
Esau and Jacob, I'm on his heels
Every step you take, you dodgin' slugs
You wake up, surrounded by doctor scrubs
He repped his set the whole time, but bein' unconscious won't stop the Blood
Listen, Beloved Dot, you need some help
We already got one Loaded
So unless you gon' change yo' name to "Unloaded", you should just be yourself
'Cause before you know it, the hood surrounds
You look around, it's a bunch of niggas, pullin' pounds
You see a bald head, and I'm not standin' over Verb with the hoodie down
Nigga they put a lot in front of me, but it was not for company
I won't say the house was on it, but a certain amount was on it, your head exactly
Anytime somethin' spill over here they put a Bounty on it
I'm just here to re-jog ya steps, see how well you write from the grave
Create a new coffin text
See we not as dumb
I mean I will leave that knowledge stuck on the wall of Kemet
Put that bullshit right back where you got it from
I get charged up, then it's slow incisions, so specific
And you gon' answer to the same charge as ya co-defendants
So where ya options go?
'Cause you can die here, it's not a quote
I get all you finished, revolver spinnin' 'til my comp is (compass) broke
I'm just seein' what you made of, that's why I aim for the heart
Been killin' all you so called names and that's my favorite part
I'm more complex then them pyramids they studied
It's like the whole time they didn't know I was aimed for the stars
Bitch, I'm aligned specific, you know it's only one way to the top
You can only get there by rhymin' gifted
You gotta climb it different, well you tried and missed it
And whatever's involved, you were supposed to learn to weather it all, but I climb it (our climate) different
And I'm right too
Word to Caitlyn Jenner you transparent (trans' parent), I see right through
This crap you call "life" is not somethin' you supposed to roll dice to
They told you, " kill JC?" He garbage too
But that accuracy bothers you
'Cause as soon as you heard Lux on ya side, you duck, 'cause you know that nigga's a target, too
It's body bags at every battle
Make sure ya homie found one
But do not jump in that bitch yet - this is only Round 1
1-0
My nigga, I don't wanna hear no bars, Loaded wit' clone shit
You'd be a stupid fuck to try to group me up
Besides, you and Beloved can still battle in the future bruh
They just sent you back to the past to get blast from Looper Lux
You in hot water, and I don't give a fuck who souped you up
Whoever got you carried away, gon' have to carry ya weight after I dead you and they suit you up
Do you suwoop or what?
You put on the flame hoodie, they thought you was the biggest Blood since the time of Suge
I'm like, "Wait, this ain't fair, he tell (fairy tale) lies
A lil' red don't mean he's from a Riding Hood ." Look in his eyes
You could, y'all know Gotti's slogan, we gotta trust that
Y'all wanna know why my nigga Geechi's eyes is always squinted?
'Cause when you shoot a nigga close-range, you gotta anticipate the blood splat
And you? Lil' nigga never was that
So we gon' skip this shit about you bein' undisputed
That's the wrong message in the venue
I mean you can't be too sharp off the 'gnac (Yak)
If got you believin' you a god with all these arms but I guess that's what the Hen' do (Hindu)
Let's get into, how you just another battle rap artist that'll take a deposit to fake like the hardest
You listen to descriptions of killers and draw, every one of yo' rounds is a facial composite
When I break you a part a this (artist)
Don't be sad, they gon' ask, "Why B even fuckin' with J?" That's an ugly match to make like The Carters
They always say he "Cut from the cloth", 'til he in front of the nigga that's makin' the garments
JC, let's be honest
Your ego and your insecurities is enormous
Like how a nigga used to be a dancer, and want y'all to forget about the past so bad
That when he get on the stage and rap he won't even give you performance!?
It's alarmin', how you only wanna be seen as a writer
Don't want nobody to forget you nicer
Yeah, you slowed down the style
'Cause you don't wanna fuck around and bust a dance move if you get too hyper
Blood, I get it, it's a marathon
That's why you slowin' down the pace
But look behind you, need I remind you
All these opponents closin' in ya space
Do a freestyle rebuttal, act out ya bars, add some more components in this race
You can't just keep pullin' out the pen (pin)
Sooner or later, it's all gon' blow up in ya face!
But before that detonate, I wanna practice what I'm preachin' and demonstrate
I wanna take that same pen (pin) grenade bar with a new style
To show you how, with cadence and flow it can be done a better way
Like, I let the flow switch up for this hoe nigga, that react to his own bars
Applauding his own lines and disguise it in showman stuff
"I'm the Greatest In The World!"
He ad-libbing, so y'all listen and show him love
Just check him out, fit it in ya head how I'm addressin' (a dressing) his whole getup
You can't just keep pullin' out the pen (pin), but then again
That makes sense for a nigga that's used to blowin' his whole shit up!
And y'all quote his stuff
This lil' nigga don't call shots
If he a thug, life is sick, and I thought we got rid of the smallpox
He tappin' y'all, wit' elementary shit and I'm really from the School Of Hard Knocks
This the drop out
Tellin' his mama he in class, just another nigga fakin' it
Well this is Sex-Ed and if the Magnum pop, whatever go inside ya fresh egg is takin' life instead of makin' it
I'm bankin' it nigga
Whatever you tryin' to infer, know I'm liver nigga
Yeah you abstract but if I give my boys the queue (Q) they puttin' Tips on this Vibrant nigga
Who ridin' witcha?
I'mma need to see some Michigan goons, gangstas and goblins nigga
If not, then as soon as you blink a nickle squeeze
But you prolly think you all three
Yeah you know, these (Ds) niggas from the Glove, can get to thinkin' they triple Gs
Negro, please!
You no mustache havin', whiskers like a rat
Compared to Ill, you wack
Nigga, that's the Yak
This nigga lookin' all kind of rat
We see police and don't speak
Keep 12 up in the dark like an insomniac
You done found ya match
And tonight, perhaps we can settle this huge debate
I'm not the nigga you can confuse today
Like why you take all these battles back-to-back-to-back
That's what a lot of these other dudes will say
You claim you eat off it, even though the flow dirty, which means you refused a plate
When Calicoe was killin' shit, he was gainin'
So, explain it: does that mean you losin'? Wait... (weight)
Skinny nigga we gon' need an intervention
Listen, I'm not tryin' to intrude ya space
I just think everybody in the room is fake
Like some Kardashians the way we scared to say
"Hey, we wanna get you some help. We think you usin' yay' ('Ye)."
Have you used today?
I'm into savin', so I'm checkin', I don't want you to start to shake on us
I mean you gotta take in to account, after I clean you out, you gon' go through withdrawls from all them drug deposits
You can bank on this
Y'all gotta think on this
A fiend is usually insecure, that's why they find comfort in the stone smoke
I seen him out in L.A., Traffic 3 with like five or six swole folk
Guess you figured when you touched down, you scorin' believability, almost
Just when you thought you got your extra point across we just keep movin' that goal post
You was around Pirus and some Crips that'll make you change that Tone Loc
You ain't know if shit was about to pop
Am I lyin'? That's why you brought them Detroit linemen
Yeah, like they know shit about the block
This gots to stop
These stories, that you build upon and that way that it's told to them, far fetched
But you the architect, so you build up walls to block the writer inside withholding the concept
I mean the dancer, the rapper, the clapper, I'm knowin' they all mesh
I get you, it fits you
These personalities you switch to, is residential
They all livin' inside ya Napoleon Complex!
Get a hold of yaself, let the ego go
You know what will help him
Baow, your soul flyin' outside of ya body
You finally gettin' over yourself
You know this is felt
And this that black African power
If these is ya last days, Julian, then this is ya last hour
Let's not pretend, that you here for a religious awakenin', not again
You solidified yo' slave mentality battlin' Loso, wearin' some of that same shit that they mock us in (moccasin)
To be honest, I think you should research and learn a little bit a little bit of your history more
'Cause that shit on your face made you look like the monkey watchin' Simba be born
All that shit, just so niggas can jump to the top?
They gotta stop it
It's not a hit for you, financial or spiritual, you're not a prophet/profit
Or a witness, you claim Blood but have zero of it pourin' wit' 'em
Then by the third round, you are everything but Muslim and Mormon pitchin'
And, to be more specific
He doesn't even share our roots, but it's not illegal to get money off imported business or foreign visit
So we holdin' it down
We knowin' he not from here, so we gon' raise the scope wit' a smile and then we gon' go sightseein' and show him a round
No, bitch, the torch is burnin'
I told y'all vers' Danny Myers, what to do wit' a body
You suppose to earn (urn) it
The clip, longer than the wait at the hospital wit' no insurance
Nigga don't just reach in those bars Beloved Dot
Keep them hands sharp
'Cause that same aim been droppin' you lames where you stand, I call 'em landmarks
Let 'em disfigure, these hands sharp as Johnny Depp with the scissors
I've got this spot forever
You cold (coal), but they tryin' to make a diamond outta you, you under a lot of pressure
I mean the proof is in the pudding, right? You believe the shit?
Well cause we is yet to see the shit
That's why I catch bodies, I'm from the Glove, the Proof is in the fingerprint
That's why I make niggas write
No more extra antics for the fame it gets him
I made the game a victim
Like a virus, my click (clique) fire when it change the system
Now it feel different
This shit worse than a 360 contract
That mean you got a upfront deal wit' it
Which explains why they keep goin' to them guns
They literally lookin' for the meal (mil') ticket
So let me get this right, we supposed to believe, it used to be gang gang
Thangs changed, so you can unify us half the battle, but the other half supposed to be bet-
Bitch stop the switchin'
Llama's spittin' at this walkin' contradiction
Big guns, Super C on Nintendo, that's actual Contra-diction
That line, won't relate to masses
That's old school, like segregated classes
That's why I only black
I still get Tweeted off shit I said in my first year
You think I care if I don't react?
I know my shit is timeless
And every move I made, outside of the playbook, won't none of ya coaches find it
But they know I ride, and if I'm there, there's a lot of figures close behind
Like everything that Oprah sign
The reason they don't like you, these fuckin' contradictions
It's just like you, Smack called and said I got B. Dot
I almost went on Strike too
It's niggas like you, we just get 'em dogged on the spot
Then he get hit wit' the .40 too (42) and it's not the Laws Of Maat
Nigga the squad for whatever
Oh but them Kemetic third rounds against a nigga who know better?
He not ready for that part of the lecture, but pardon professor
I heard those third rounds be yo' hardest semester
Well what about that against a nigga- well nah
Mine against yo' third round, we can combine throwin' up Blood and bein' conscious together
Bitch, I'm the clip-squeezer!
Fuck is a Kemetic Blood to the crypt (Crip) keeper?
I polished it, acknowledge it
It's gon' take you all the science in Kemet to get you outta this
'Cause once Smack said I had to make time for this and I decided to fit you in this slaughter
You went from Los Angeles to lost like Atlantis is
'Cause no matter where he sit, he (city) underwater
Round 2!
2-0!

Look not upon me because I am black
Versus Iron, when you started that, I sorta clapped
But then I got reminded, they may be blinded
But a nigga like me, can see through them distorted raps
You made it a black vs white thing, so of course we was supportin' that
But Africa the motherland
So how you gon' vacay away and think that's gon' resort to facts
This was all an act
You prolly felt incredible, for the obvious reachin'
And y'all thought he was probably preachin'
Yeah that was a song of Solomon, but that was a female talkin' in the scripture, it wasn't even Solomon speakin'
Here I go wit' the teachin', about how I think all of these religions is big jokes
But when I think about it y'all way (Yahweh), maybe it is divine intervention
How that video you made never landed in the hand of Chris Stokes, but we gon' skip though
Back to Solomon, I don't think he even existed, let alone was he anointed with pigment
I'm 'bout to show y'all the distance
Between a nigga that's always pointin' to the pen
And somebody that's pinpointin' the difference
For instance, I was named a clone
And seemingly, I thought I was in that race alone
Til JC started conscious rantin', with his third eye, ravin' (raven)
Well I see the future in this Game Of Thrones
Ask Daylyt, who changed his soul
I was the one! Before me it was number twos on any stage he on
He was sleepin', barely breathin'
Think sleep apnea cause after we wrapped it up, it was oxygen in the mask and he came back strong
And that's what made me known
Without my nigga 'Lyt that day I would've never got acknowledged
Y'all was talkin' 'bout knockin' a niggas brains to the floor 'til I came through truly droppin' knowledge
And y'all applaud this novice?
Versus Iron y'all said he was as conscious as Dot is
Cause he told the white man we the original, do y'all understand how unoriginal that thought is?
I mean it's awkward to all of a sudden start rappin' wit' purpose but only scratch at the surface
Y'all gotta look at his material
The fabric-ated lines, the wool over eyes, it's always a disguise when they wolfing out the Biblical
It's principle, and you gotta be from certain schools of thought to understand how Hebrews was taught
You thought you was breakin' new ground
Well I'm here to shake up the Earth 'bout those lines that you used at fault
We Africans, not Hebrews, let's not confuse this part
You struck Iron before it was hot
And I'ma go into that same book you used to diffuse his spark
Let's view this arc, y'all know a nigga know this shit
But peep how cold it gets
Noah was drunk and he got mad at his son Ham cause he noticed it
But focus quick, cause in the Bible, Ham is supposed to represent Africa
So Noah cursed him, said, "Your descendants will be slavin'. Your son Canaan and anything comin' after ya."
So, add this up, and when you equal the sum, break this down and explain to me
So you claim that original Jew shit?
So you cool wit', a book that was used when the white man was justifyin' slavery?
It amazes me, how I give y'all direction and y'all still let the white man change the route
It's like ya battle vs T-Top
Even when you try to put on blacks, somewhere we still see white tee hangin' out
Jews lied about they whole history
Abraham never existed and God didn't choose a few
Black people we are west Africans, them stories ain't got nothin' to do witchu
But you, do what you usually do
So I'm not complainin' anymore
About a parasite that need a host to get on track
I mean Smack, you just another train that he can board
Said he wasn't believable, that's when he found a new Vice and start bangin' to the core
Well of course, I'm not surprised
Here go another god named JC claimin' that he Lord
I mean sure, you gang bang, you from the hood after all
Nigga stop, you a good kid, don't poke ya chest out when you never had to brawl
And if you did have beef wit' niggas, y'all prolly squared it up to dance it off
When I'm from, when niggas show out then we clap applaud
No lyin' (Lion) King, we was taught to keep a grip
Don't slip in a stampede cause the pride never lands after fall
We was dialed in, where lil' niggas like this never had to call
That's why I'm mad at y'all
Y'all let this good kid Julian rap about gats too long
He could've did anything wit' the pen
Instead he tryin' to be gangsta to get some respect that he feel like he lack from y'all
JC in the desert, gettin' tempted
But the guns, drugs, bitches and cash involved
You said, "Jesus was black"? Well even though the facts is flawed
You should know, when you God, you can't be tempted by shit cause you already have it all
This is class for dawg, you can't fuck around like you new to (neuter) this
I see who the pupil is
Well class is in session, come learn you a lesson, little nigga I'm finna tutor this
Let's maneuver this, idea that religion is what makes our survival
Cause here we have a Vice Lord sayin' he Hebrew, I can't believe you claimin' the title
Gee, these (GD) niggas got me confused cause
Hebrews use the Star of David, now this information is vital
Cause this same six point star, is also used by the Gangster Disciples
Aye, Vice Lord, ain't them your rivals?
This is tribal, and you the (Judah) one that think black people cursed cause we broke God's commandments
Like, Thou Shall Not Kill
Yet in still in all yo' battles you kill, nigga I can't understand this
Who plants this, seed that make y'all believe this tree can grow for the greater good
Cause you can be killed by a GD, rockin' the same symbol that represents what yo' nation should
You can't be Vice Lord and praise the black Christ Lord, there ain't no way you could
So here's the detail
Next time I see you throw up that V.L
I'ma break your wrist and drop you off in the wrong neighborhood
You gettin' flamed for good
You in here wit' the fire starter
The letter "J" don't exist in the Hebrew language
So when we take it off ya name it explains how you lyin' Carter
You gon' die a martyr
You should've never taken me bro
And since you Vice Lord, then tell us, have you taken your oath?
You see, Hebrews believed that Yahweh the only god in the sky
But when you Vice Lord, you gotta take an oath
And inside that oath says "God is Allah"
So are you Muslim or Hebrew? Which one of them you choose?
Maybe you never signed that Vice Lord oath
All this talk about a pen that was never really put to use
I'm a bit confused
All I need is a pro test (protest) for y'all to see this shit
Every other bar he callin' the cop or nick something when he squeeze the fifth
If I talked about the white man, I really mean the shit
He used the race card just to bait y'all, he must see you as fish
But if you know about anything that he brews (Hebrews), J, C (see) they don't even believe you (Jew) exist
I'm your crucifix
And this that black African power
And if these is yo' last days Julian, then this was yo' last hour

Black power right, Beloved Dot?
That's startin' to seem like one of your comfort spots
So let's rap 'bout the shit
Cause too many niggas ask 'bout the shit
A conscious gang banger is a contradiction, we've acknowledged this
First two rounds, no black power shit, I'ma kill you, bang bang
Third round, "Nigga...y'all gotta snap outta this."
The same cat, who will paint his face vs Loso to show where his brain at
Will tell his black brother, "We need to unify" before lettin' them thangs clap
You wanna know why that Kemet shit not for us? One strange fact
There was kings there, we were slaves here
Where is it in Kemet that can explain that?
Now it's yo' time to be saved
Stop paintin' yo' fuckin' face and tellin' other niggas how to behave
Stop actin' like you got the third rounds that contain the answers for black problems today
Stop goin' home and writin' bullshit songs tryin' to get a response from Kanye
And, do you like my fuckin' fit today?
I figured you would, it's my way of makin' light of the fraudulent shit you say
And it get more and more sick
This was sent to me, by a student of Polite's and a classmate of yours, and you won't ignore it
Cause you do way too much unity preachin' with these bum ass letters to Kanye in yo' home recordings
To have yo' personal classmates hittin' me up cause you won't support him
He won't support him, the fuckin' irony
And niggas think it's cause of yo' teacher?
I say it's cause what he taught you
You lost too, you left Christianity to follow more shit you don't belong to
And yo' mission, is to guide a bunch of lost niggas...nowhere
And that shit can only be done with evil in mind
Marco Polo, not the writer, even though he was another thief of his time
But I mean the game, where a whole purpose is misleadin' the blind
The fact that you claim Blood every other battle, that's only how silly niggas movin'
I mean if you not lost, this is like right in the middle of you losin'
You niggas run wit' that religion 'til the beast sit him like a Buddhist
You pray, to a top dog like the image of Anubis
I do this
I really don't know what to take from y'all
I mean it's more dimensions to you than the pyramids y'all worship
From the stones to the ancient walls
The problem is the fact that we need to unify comes after the red raggin'
Not sayin' it's not a place at all, but it's contradictory
Ref, you gotta drop that flag before you make the call
The fact that we need to unify, always come after this red rag shit
Not sayin' it's not a place at all, but it's hypocrisy
Ref, you gotta drop that flag before you make the call
But no response necessary, silence is golden
That's why I always use it when I let the ratchet off
Lay a fag in chalk
All y'all gon' hear is a body drop, like when Maggie walk
This that same nigga who mirrored the image of Loaded Lux
Then thought that it would help him skip the ropes
Didn't get that feature he wanted, realized Lux (luck's) not on his side, then that mirror broke
This the smoke niggas died from
Survivors can lose a lung from it
Engaging with the ratchets soon as I touch 'em, it's like we rushin' (Russian) shit
The shit meant to get under ya skin, that's why niggas get cut from it
They switch up, but I can tell by the cloth you switched too, you not really cut from it
You supposed to kill them niggas before you die, you done made my bucket list
Jungle shit, grip on me like it's tailored; custom fit
Don't mention it, it's not worth the shot
And I won't mention y'all criticizin' the form on a perfect shot
But it's worth the shot and it's worth the watch
I get all the troops then we purge the spot
Then we target you, then we circle Dot
With all the proof, you a wild liar
You want these niggas to say you woke? Were your rounds fire?
If we really do need to unify
Then what the fuck is all the red raggin' in the rounds prior?
Don't even answer that!
Let's just say I'm about that kill-a-nigga life too, let's just say we not better
You can relieve my efforts
Replace yo' third rounds with one of mine
BAOW! I like the unconscious B. Dot better
That's for tryin' to resist
One shot, he gotta have all his vitamins sipped
But if I let these two point? Five
Word to Smack the first thing gets striked will end quick
B. Dot, it is over with
Overdose from the dopest pen
And y'all know I wrote the shit
Cause y'all just witnessed this nigga's eulogy
My 

I can't take this pain no more
Liquor bottles there ain't no more
All this stress theres plently more
All these people yea i gave them all
Where are they now
They come and go
I ask myself Why do i try
I dont know
I dont know

Can't trust nobody these days
Promises theyre all fake
Everybody is fake
Why so many damn hate
I can't even trust my family
They try to me Bring me down
I tell them i do it for them
Suddenly My dreams all drown..
I drown myself in my tears (yea)
I drown myself in my fears (yea)
I glance here from the stairs
How everybody seems to live well
Though they might be just like me
Fighting demons just like me
Masking their pain with a smile just like me
See
Ive been holding this in for way to long
Hear my words of distress
Ive been tryna remain strong
But Its time to finally confess
What i feel inside so i wrote it down
So the world can hear my sound
Thats so profound
Before its to late
And im not around

Lately it's been hard for me to smile
Try so hard but im in denial
All those names that i've been told
They're running through my head
Like im running miles
How long while this go on for?
I don't know but i am sure it will be a while

I wonder if love was not meant for me
Cause everytime i try they break me
I give them my all they take advantage
I give them my heart
They give me fragments in return
And i return cause i just do not learn
Its hard to discern
Who will overturn and hurt you
I think you about you everyday
Wondering if you are okay
Living my life day by day
Looking through my pictures and i see your face
Memories start flashing
Open up the numberpad and start dialying
Cancel the call cause i can't do this
And im back to where i started
See i tried and i tried
But you still werent content
Gave you all i had but wanted me to conquest
More than the world for you
And if it weren't for you
I would've never realized the lies you told me
To blinded with this love
That diguised it from me
Everyone told me that your love wasn't real
I ignored their appeal
And continued to fall for you
Cause i knew inside you felt something for me
No matter what people told me
They tried to show me
I tried to show them
The angel that you were for me
You were forming a person in me
That i never knew that i could be
But Now that youre gone
I honestly dont know what's left of me..
Lately it's been hard for me to smile
Try so hard but im in denial
All those names that i've been told
They're running through my head
Like i'm running miles
How long while this go on for?
I don't know but i am sure it will be a while

I cry myself to sleep
It seems that All these dreams
Are just some fantasy
To all my family
I told myself that one day
I'd try make a change
Like martin luther king
Hes still remembered to this day
I was barely 13
When i decided to start rapping
I told a few people
They just started laughing
My friends started to fade away
Now im alone and on my way
Still tryna find my purpose
Music helps me cope with the pain
Life hasnt been same
Ever since i moved to a different state
But here is where i picked up the mic
And began my journey
Experienced the fast life
Surrounded by people
Who wanna live the same life
In the studio all day and all night
Hoping our voice gets heard
But its hard with all this new music
Which is now preferred it so absurd
Do you live the same shit thats all slurred
On the verge of quitting
But J Cole taught me to never omit
And stay commited
So here i am sitting
In this room alone Thinking
Of ways to possibly
Finally make a

Step to the rear, Grand Pu is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, singin' songs called survival
Runnin' 'round town givin' all the girls Puba snacks
I wouldn't try to steal a style, you just might catch a cardiac
Figured the way to get paid is to grab the mic, rehearse, ya know
Smooth as Jermaine, so honey, don't take it personal
There's no need of tryin' to diss the swinger
Baby, all you catch is two snaps up and the finger
The Babalu bad boy, a threat to the paranoid
You try to step to this? It's void!
A new hit from the Grand Man, work nights like the Sandman
Gain for awake in case I gotta stomp a head out
Bustin' is a trick that's not up my sleeve
It's possessed with finesse and it works when I breathe
Paid in the shade with a "A" as the grade
With the papes that I made from this trade
So get hip to the grip, you know where to slide the chips
If you wanna cash in on the wins
Grand Puba and I love to hit skins

"I've got a song to sing"
"Here we go!"
Follow me now!
"Okay, everybody..." x6]

Yeah... bust it!
Grand Puba, the higher mystic ruler, keep a forty in the cooler
She don't know me, money grip, you better school her
Before I have to play her the foul way
And catch a quick short stay at the Holiday
Now, forecast says I won't be playin' soccer with the dreads
Ballin's my hobby, doin' wonders in the bed
From full-size to king-size to queen-size to high-rise
Even bunk beds, I know how to work the leg
If Pu ain't the answer, then you must be sick as cancer
Smooth romancer, let it ring, I'll probably answer
So come take a dip with your private dancer
Nasty, naughty, over six call me shorty
But I'm loooong, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
I go on and on and on and on...
Never in a scandal and I'm never caught schemin'
Knew Pu was dope ever since I was semen
Swimmin' in my daddy's big nuts
But now I'm scoopin' girls with the big ol' butts
Arise to respond for the Maxwell
Ask well, hell, it don't even matter
Puba ain't game for the shit chit-chatter
Puba's in town, oh shit! Let's scatter
You can hide that ass, but it just don't matter
The 90's is here, Pu is on a mash-out
Huns that I've done always seem to pass out
But hun, wake that ass up, this ain't the place to crash out
You try to play me? I have to throw that ass out
Foes and hoes, good riddance
'Cause when Puba comes out, there'll be no skiddin'
I'll slide upstairs and see Chuck at the chop shop
Tell him fade the sides, let it wolf on top
Reel and reel and soul to soul
Honey, heel to heel and toe to toe
It really doesn't make a diff', I'm not the type to riff
I might smoke a spliff but I won't sniff
And ya don't stop
Now I'mma end it like this...
I'm like Superfly Snuka, know how to hook a hooker
Caught her on looker, know where I took her?
To the short stay, around my way
And like Monie say, it was the perfect way
I caught a verse from the Christian, and it goes "Praise the Lord"
Skins lined up on a wharf for when I'm bored
I'm from Now Rule, I'm in the right mood
And if you like the way that this flows, well, that's cool
See, this is no illusion, the style is too confusin'
If you try to bite, then you're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Back up, sonny, and let me make my money
Then I'm straight, I got a date at 8
So see you brothers later, time to motivate
Yeah, now bust it...

I'd like to give a shout to my Brand Nubian brothers
Lord Jamar, God Allah...
Derrick X on the flex, and Alamo
And we gonna give a shout to the SD50s who pumped this
And I'mma say, yo, 
1 ContributorMisguided Lyrics
(Verse)
Probably misguided as ever
Where art grow with the devil
And shake hands in the middle of death lands to travel
We on the back road, saddled, and all cozy
You portrait a smile, laugh, i lapse slowly
Manic be my past, seed the friction in death homie
411 premonition, then i turned it to a figment
Shit if I can’t sleep then I’ll play for vengeance
No more bad blood, I’ll just fire up the engines
I been running from my past since a year I wasn’t mentioned
Praying for the youth 'll probably be my dеath sentence
I’vе been dying just to live and love has always been my witness
Bleeding from the heart, the brain is just an empty canvas
Slam it, programs will damage good hearts
No random cold heart will vanish slow, start
Thinking of yo self, the cancer is store bought
Man made cancer i’m serving them flow charts
On how to blow smoke in the middle of yo block
(Hook x 2)
Probably misguided as ever
Where art grow with the devil
And shake hands in the middle of dark roads foreshadowed
I’m on the back road saddle and all ...

I don’t know why she mad, so I had to hit her
Why the **** my cousin looking for his 4 wheeler?
I just need some ****ing water and some sugar

Why your car only go to the first gear?
Feel like D.C. Young Fly, bring that *** here
Why you got the water but it’s not crystal clear?

They have sent you a letter to come back home to play
But to your dismay, this isn't your day
For the happy fun time has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
I am alive, immortalised
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey, there's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight

Rascal Flatts:
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long

So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills
All these bills piled up on my desk
They looking like a mountain (Everest)
All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'
Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with 50 thousand (50 thousand?)

The Lonely Island:
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty-year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be carefulo
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes

My pen'll go off when I halfcock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it

But as rude and as indecent as all hell

And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

After the battle, masterless cattle
Overlords hanging by a thread
With a bit of bravado, maybe tomorrow
We'll be atop the heap
While the rest of Hell's ****ing

Nature abhors a power vacuum
It leaves room for you and me
The future of Hell belongs to the Vee's
This place reeks of death, there's a chill in the air

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope
