I can't keep my mind off a better time and place
Think I'll fake sick
Flat just sneak on out
Call up the crew and find out who
Just can't stop thinkin' bout
Chorus:
Cold beer and a fishin' pole
A little lake off a back road
All the friends my truck can hold
Some charcoal
And a cooler full of ice
Pyramid of empty cans
Short shorts and sun tans
A little bonfire romance later on tonight
Hey ol' Joe'll go at the drop of a hat
Bring them girls again I won't even have to ask
I bet the word will spread, it always does
And if the fish don't bite, hey that's alright
Cause we can sure 'nough catch a buzz
Chorus:
Cold beer and a fishin' pole
A little lake off a back road
All the friends my truck can hold
Some charcoal
And a cooler full of ice
We'll build a pyramid of empty cans
Short shorts and sun tans
A little bonfire romance later on tonight

What'cha waitin for, bring it on
We're gonna party from dusk till dawn
Singin' songs
Just bring your own
Chorus:
Cold beer and a fishin' pole
A little lake off a back road
All the friends my truck can hold
Some charcoal
And a cooler full of ice
We'll build a pyramid of empty cans
Get a little bit of sun tan
Add some bonfire romance later on
