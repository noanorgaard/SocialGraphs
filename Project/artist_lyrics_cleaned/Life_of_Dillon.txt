Now when your girl is gone and you're broke in two
You need a little bit o' soul to see you through
And when you raise the roof, when you rock and roll
You get a lot more kicks with a little bit o' soul

And when your party falls 'cause ain't nobody groovin'
A little bit o' soul and it really starts movin', yeah

And when you're in a mess and you feel like cryin'
Just remember this little song of mine
And as you go through life tryin' to reach your goal
Just remember what I said 'bout a little bit o' soul

A little bit o' soul, yeah, a little bit o' soul You might also

Mum told me it was over, but I didn't listen
Right until the end I kept being optimistic
10 years could pass and I would feel no different
Hole in my heart, no one else can fill it
I wish you got to go to Barbados
Five stars, now they finally paid us
I'm working hard so that you see me winning
Mumsi I will always miss you
Why do I have to have another angel on my side?
I can't work it out, no matter how many times I try
I can't work it out, no matter how many times I try

Said I might lose my way
But I won't lose myself, yeah
It's your life you can live how you want
But don't blame it on no one else
We all lose some, win some
And sometimes we all need help
But do what you do
It's your life you can live how you want
But don't blame it on no one else

Just another year, tryna be a billionaire
I tryna stay focus, while I'm filling with fears
Missing my mother, my father and brothers
My sister and friends
And every year it gets tougher
Stuck on the stairs, but I'm not good with prayers
So I wear a hat to cover up, my ginger hair 'cause
If they could see me, they'd see I'm receding
And that one step back, will knock you off your feet and
If you get up, well remember what's up, yeah
The reason you believe in losing all that you got
I gave my heart to another, now it's borrowed a lot
Been counting change in my pocket, never noticed I lost
Everything that I live for, everything that I was
Sometimes you never know what you've got
Until it's gone, until it's gone

Said I might lose my way
But I won't lose myself, yeah
It's your life you can live how you want
But don't blame it on no one else
We all lose some, win some
And sometimes we all need help
But do what you do
It's your life you can live how you want
But don't blame it on no one else
So why you focused on them?
And why you talking 'bout me?
You should be thinking 'bout you
Before it's too late to...
Instead of thinking 'bout them
Instead of talking 'bout me
Maybe focus on you
Oooh-oooh-oooh

Said I might lose my way
But I won't lose myself, yeah
It's your life you can live how you want
But don't blame it on no one else
We all lose some, win some
