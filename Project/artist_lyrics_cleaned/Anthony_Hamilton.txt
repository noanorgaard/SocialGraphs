But you didn't treat it right
No, you didn't; no, you didn't, girl
Too busy running out all night long
Didn't even have the decency to pick up the telephone

Here we are in the storm of our life
Both posing as strangers who never fell in love
Knowing damn well it's a shame, so this evening
I just want us back the way we were
We lost it all in the blink of an eye
We stopped saying "I love you," spending quality time
Lord, help us help us, we're running out of seasons, woo-hoo

How we gonna get us back to love?

Here we are on the ride of our life
Going our separate directions, holding no end in sight
No idea when we lost sight of the finish
Our love cup is empty, we put no effort in it
And we chose to play it off
Knowing everyone sees there's a hole in our hearts
And Lord, help us, help us make it easy
We're running out of seasons, hey

That's when I saw somebody else

Grabbed my Louis bags and packed, thinking
