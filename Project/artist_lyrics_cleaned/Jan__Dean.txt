Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around
(Bust your buns, bust your buns now)
It's catching on in every city and town
You can do the tricks the surfers do
Just try a Quasimodo or the Coffin too
Why don't you...
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You'll probably wipeout when you first try to shoot the curve
(Bust your buns, bust your buns now)
Taking gas in a bush takes a lot of nerve
Those hopscotch poledads and pedestrians too will bug you
Shout "Cowabunga" now and skate right on through
Why don't you...
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
You can do the tricks the surfers do
Just try a Quasimodo or the Coffin too
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

So get your girl and take her tandem down the street
(Bust your buns, bust your buns now)
Then she'll know you're an asphalt athlete
A downhill grade, man, will give you a kick
But if the sidewalk's cracked, you better pull out quick
Why don't you...
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
Come along and...
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?You might also

Because you held me tight

Heart and soul
I begged to be adored, lost control
And tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were minds so strangely willing
Uh huh, but now I see
What one embrace can do, look at me
It's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul

Bom ba bom bom, ba dip da dip dip
Da da da da, dun, dun, da ding, da ding, da dong
Bom ba bom bom, ba dip da dip dip
Da bom ba ba bom bom, dip, da dip, da dip
