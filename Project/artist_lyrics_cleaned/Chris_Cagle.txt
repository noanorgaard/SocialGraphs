Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it

Black top road, learner permit
Thought I was Earnhardt
Drivin' fast but I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox, then a fence and then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmer's daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it

Just throw caution to the wind, my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin, cause


Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it
Hey the chicks dig it
The chicks dig it (

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout
Yes what kinda gone are we talkin bout here

1 ContributorNight On the Country Lyrics
Summertime
Drivin' fast down an old back road
Feelin' fine
Got Skynyrd on the radio
The moon is bright
Me and my baby gonna break new ground
On a blanket in a field of green
Yeah the crickets sing a song to me, it goes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Fireflies
They burn better than candlelight
Ol' Bob White down in the holler sings a lullaby
You and me
Well that's just enough company
So baby listen to the nighttime breeze
You can hear it singin' though the trees

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Baby, listen to the nighttime breeze
You can hear it singin' through the trees, it goes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
How 'bout a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh
Cause those city lights bring me down

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Give me a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I said a night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
A night on the country
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It beats a night on the town, woo
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Those city lights bring me down
Yeah,
