It's like you see right through me and make it easier
And believe me, you don't even have to try
Oh, because

You are the best thing (You're the best thing)
You are the best thing (You're the best thing, baby)

You know I hope and I pray that you believe me
When I say this love will never fade away

Both of us have known love before
To come on up promising like the spring, to walk on out the door

I ain't about to go straight
It's too late

I found myself face down in the ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you, holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means

Been so long since I seen your face
Or felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this here suitcase

That's when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on

Let it be me

When it feels like you're always comin' up last

You reach out for something and they slap your hand

Just how it feels to be all alone
To feel like you'd give anything
