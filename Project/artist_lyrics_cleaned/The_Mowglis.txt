With every beautiful new sight
I see that perfect golden light
Against your eyes
Tried to hold it up, try to live it up
Seal it with your touch, everything at once

You only get what you put in, to this life
So how could anybody be living in a bad dream

Oh, when you got this open road
And the sun is shining
How could anybody be living in a bad dream
Ooh, with the top down drivin' slow
All the love that I know
How could anybody be living in a bad dream

Last night my dreams were on TV
I stepped away to watch the world play out, in front of me
Sorrow in your eyes isn't a real life
Its good enough for me, good enough tonight

Well, I lost my head in San Francisco
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It was smiling down

Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul

Well, I've been in love with love, and the
Idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I've seen time tell tales about that
Systematic drug, yeah, that heart that beats as one
It's collectively, unconsciously composed

Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
Do you feel the love? I feel the love

But it's alright
It's getting better all the time
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
You know we're falling together
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
And it just keeps getting better

Well I sit up on your bed
And you just biting at my neck
You're begging, "Baby, please don't
Baby, don't you leave"
But I gotta go and write these songs
So you don't have to get a job
And you just smile at me and drift back into sleep

I went and wrote this song
So you don't have to get a job
So just keep laying there and smiling in your 

Trying to figure out who I am
Or who I’m supposed to be
Feel good about where I stand
So I can make the most of me, I’m
Coming back down from space
A million miles away
There’s a lot of love in this place
(Oh) And I’m just trying to say

I’m good, I’m good, I’m good, I’m good
Living life just like I should
Wouldn’t change it if I could

It’s been with you since you were born
Since you were born

Find a way to be a better person
If we come together like we should
We could all be good
