And I've changed a lot since then, ask my friends
The crying stopped on top of that, my eyes forgot
An old flame who got her hips on a bucket list
And times missed every night since we first kissed

Oh, lover, when you call me out
Pull me up to ground, mouth to mouth
Oh, lover, when you call me out

Do you feel like breaking my fall?
Love, I feel like nothing at all
And if you feel like breaking my fall
You can tell me, "Boy, I want more"

And I've changed a lot since then, ask my friends
My clothes, my frame, I've spent enough, but feel the same
Well, in times change, bodies go while mine remains
Now, her laughter's a rhyme, shoulder melody, neck the first line

Oh, lover, when you call me out
Pull me up to ground, mouth to mouth
Oh, lover, when you call me out

Do you feel like breaking my fall?
Love, I feel like nothing at all
And if you feel like breaking my fall
You can tell me, "Boy, I want more"

And I'll be waiting when you come, and call
Give it away, give it away
I can burn that bridge when we get to it
Give it away, give it away
And I'll be waiting when you come and call
Give it away, give it away
I can burn that bridge when we get to it
Give it away, give it away

Oh, lover, when you call me out
Pull me up to ground, mouth to mouth
Oh, lover, when you call me out
Do you feel like breaking my fall?
You can tell me, "It meant nothing at all" (Oh, lover, when you call me out)
And if you feel like breaking my fall (Oh, lover, when you call me out)
You can tell me, "Boy, I want more" (Oh, lover, when you call me 

And if heaven would have me
I would gladly go
And if hell would take me
Drag me down below, oh

We could fall in love and we could fall apart
Call up all our friends and we can call it art
What's your favourite colour?
I want to be your lover

I'm gonna shed the skin I'm in
Before I wear myself too thin
Hang my body out to dry
Underneath your loving eyes

And if heaven would have me
I would gladly go
And if hell would take me
Drag me down below, oh

What's your favourite colour?
I want to be your lover

You send shivers down my spine
Yes I feel it this time
I don't want to fuck
I want to fall in love with someone

Does it feel good when we do it
Do you wanna come back around
Does it feel good when we do it
Do you wanna come back around
You'll call and I'll call and we'll talk into the night
There's nothing we could do but fall into the blue (Oh, oh-oh)
Chasms of your eyes or the space between your thighs

We could fall in love or we can fall apart
Call up all our friends and we could call it art
What's your favourite colour?
I want to be your lover
You send shivers down my spine
Yes I feel it this time
I don't want to fuck
I want to fall in love with
