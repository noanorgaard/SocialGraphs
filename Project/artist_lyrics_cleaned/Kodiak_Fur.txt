1 ContributorI’ll Be Waiting Lyrics(Verse 1)
I've got a picture of, the skin she hides away, I keep it on a shelf
I ask her what it's like, she says the taste of salts
Come see it for yourself
In a day in may
Nothing broken, nothing lost
Everything to gain
Come share your lips with mine,
I want to see it through
Only me and you
(Chorus)
Call me up, every night
All alone
I'll be waiting
Call me up, every night
All alone
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting
(Verse 2)
I've got a picture of, the skin she hides away, I keep it on a shelf
I ask her what its like, she says the taste of salts
Come see it for your self
In a day in may
Nothing broken, nothing lost
Everything to gain
Come share your lips with mine,
I want to see it through
Only me and you
In her fathers car, she says she isn't scared
She'll go anywhere, she'll go anywhere
And in her mothers bag
With her earrings on
She'll do anything
(Chorus)
Call me up, every night
All alone
I'll be waiting
Call me up, every night
All alone
I'll be waiting, I'll be
