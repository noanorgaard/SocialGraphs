Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo

But I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find you and I collide

Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
You might also like
I'm quiet, you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back, you fall in time
I somehow find you and I collide

Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind

Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find you and I collide

Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
You finally find you and I collide
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
You finally find you and I collide
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, doo
Doo, doo-doo, 

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
And now these days are gone
I'm not so self-assured
Now I'm fine, I changed my mind
I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then, I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me

You finally find you and I, you and I
Well, I've—
