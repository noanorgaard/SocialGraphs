There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
A little bit of devil in her angel eyes

Saturday night she’s rockin’ out by the bonfire
Flirting from that tail gate and crankin’ up the dial
Come Sunday mornin’ she’ll be singing with the choir
Drivin’ me crazy with that kiss me smile

There’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
You might also like
And I can’t stop wonderin’ what it would feel like, to hold her all night
She’s got that something, that sexy innocence, she must be heaven sent

There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
There’s a little bit of devil in her
In those angel, in those angel
