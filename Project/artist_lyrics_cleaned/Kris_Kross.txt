I like my stuff knockin' (Knockin')
I love it when the girlies be like jockin' (Jockin')
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah, you know me
I got you jumpin' an' bumpin' an' pumpin' movin' all around, G
In the mix, I made MC's step back
They tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuthin' fake and you can understand every word (Word, hahaha)
As you listen to my cool, smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P
