And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

And I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping, but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though, but I always want to

And I'd love you, but I need another year alone

And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another second to myself

And I raced through soundcheck
Just to meet you on your fag break
And you convince me to put life aside and want you

And if only for the sake of it I could chill you out
And drive us through the night to your sister's
You could fall asleep with my jacket as a cover
And wake up just to join me to smoke (Yeah)

I wanted everything at once
Until you blew me out my mind
And now I don't need nothing

Maybe I don't act the way I used to
'Cause I don't feel the same that I did
The fact that's a lie is 'cause I want you

We'll be talking 'bout your background
And how it never left you much
And 'cause you grew up in a small town
You'll appreciate it more
When you're done figuring your life out

And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me, you know
He used to see her, but she sold
Him off on down the river

It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress­ fit for the summer
So, you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full­ of filth
Yes, I know

But let me know when I'm needed home

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide

Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Twice, twice it brought me down but it's the last time

Maybe I'll grow tired
Of you bitchin' all the time
'Cause when you love the way you’re living
It's just hard to fret about much
Because if I get time, I just regret most shit
