You made me insecure, told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge, when you're a diamond in the rough?
I'm sure you've got some things you'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me, I wouldn't wanna be anybody else

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
You've got every right to a beautiful life, come on

Who says? Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin'?
Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful? Who says?

It's such a funny thing, now nothing's funny when it's you

Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em

Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head (Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
