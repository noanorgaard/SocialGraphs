Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrilling in spite of the chilling weather
Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin'
Together, together
Together, together
You might also like
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Winter wonder, winter wonderland
Winter, winter, wonder
