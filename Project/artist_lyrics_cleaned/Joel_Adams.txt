Nobody ever knows
Nobody ever sees
I left my soul back then, now I'm too weak

Most nights I pray for you to come home (Mm)
Praying to the Lord
Praying for my soul

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

'Cause I don't ever wanna know (Oh)
Don't ever wanna see things change
'Cause when I'm living on my own
I wanna take it back and start again

Most nights I pray for you to come home (Home)
I'm praying to the Lord
Praying for my soul

Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
I sent so many messages you don't reply
Oh-oh-oh (Yeah, baby)
I gotta figure out, what am I missing, babe?
Singing now, oh-oh-oh
And I need you now, I need your love (Yeah, baby)
Oh, woah
Now please don't go (Oh no)
I said well most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
Ah, so please don't (Please) don't go
So please (Please) don't go (Oh no)
(Please) Don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone (Oh)
So please don't go
