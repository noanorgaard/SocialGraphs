Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta, feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica, now I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta, I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz, hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors, some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one, started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you wannabe, gonna-be, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters?
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta, a real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches, ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil' J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign, and play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out, and end up hitting her ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players, and everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger, and his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much, all you hear is the blap from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit, 'cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit, do the shit, hit the pen, don't let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game, 'cause damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta, getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world, but the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community, so we can bust you-know-who
So voters of the world, keep supporting me, and I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me to win, I'd sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts, and damn, it feels good to be a 

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close I start sweatin', and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, "Take a chill, B."
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga tryna kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows, every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars, everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right, I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured, I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin', three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me, but yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive, havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after, and if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizin' that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend, me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags, 'til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured, but this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend, it wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets, my hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie
My mind is playin' tricks on
