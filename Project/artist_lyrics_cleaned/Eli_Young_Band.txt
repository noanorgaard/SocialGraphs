Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Wouldn’t last a single day
I’d probably just fade away
Without you, I’d lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin’ life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl
Like crazy, girl

And turn the radio up (Turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got a full tank of gas (She got a full tank of gas)
Ain't no stopping her now

She got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes
Are leaving nothing in that rear view
But dust, nothing but dust

She's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years
Of the only life she's ever known
But there's a future that's bright in the dead of this night
And all she's gotta do is go

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure
