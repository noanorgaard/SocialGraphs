You might also like
Beatrice, bitch please
You know who I be
Nothin' else, none other
The number one stunna
Nigga, I pimp hoes
Boss, toss, flip hoes
Show them bitches no love
Ridin 2G 'llac on dubs
Ounces, quarters, halves, bricks
Nigga I done sold all that shit
Soon as my tour stop
Bought five Bentley Azures, props
TV's must, buttons must
C.M.B., platinum plus

I like loud pipes
Big rims, mo' ice
V-twelves or better
No itch strictly leather
Playstation, DVD's
Don't worry about yo bitch
She comin' wit' me
Leavin' stickers on the Bentley
To show the price
Arm out the windows
Just to floss my ice
Fresh, wait hold up
That's that bitch we fucked
Nigga what yo' bank 'bout
Dog I've been lost count
Pop that Crist', pop that Mo'
Slap that bitch, punch that ho
