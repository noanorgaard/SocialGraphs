You were everybody's son

You watched me lose my way
And I didn't want to hear it
Made all the big mistakes
Didn't know I was being selfish
Lying to get more time in on that dirty road
Why am I so blind
When it's you and I alone?

You were everybody's son
Heyyy
You were everybody's son
You might also like
I didn't know before
But now I've seen it all
Give me some more
Give me some more
It took a little time
To open up my eyes
Know you were mine
Know you were always mine

It's funny what you find
When you're not looking forward
And lying to get more time in
On that dirty road
Why am I so blind
When it's you and I alone?
Blinding the perfect places
Only we can go
Driving in that old car
On that dirty road

You were everybody's son
Heyyy
You were everybody's son
Heyyy
Everybody's son
Hooouuu
Everybody's 

Where have you gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where have you gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

Lost through time and that's all I need
So much love, then one day buried
Hope you're safe, 'cause I lay you leaves
Is there more than we can see?
Answers for me

And hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soles
And hey, hey
Let the water in

Where have you gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where have you gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

And I get lonely without you
And I can't move on
And I get lonely without you
I can't move on
Move on

Where have you gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Oh, how, how?
