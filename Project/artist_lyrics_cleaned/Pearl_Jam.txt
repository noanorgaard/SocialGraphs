We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standin' all around
Something warm rollin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me, darling, just a little while"
I held her close, I kissed her, our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
Well, now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night

While she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
Why, I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare
I, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, hey, I'm still alive

"Is something wrong?" she said, well of course there is
"You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question?
And if so, if so who answers? Who answers?
I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, hey, I'm still alive
Hey, I, hey, I'm still alive
Yeah, I, ooh, I'm still alive!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ooh yeah, ooh, ooh
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, 

At home, drawin' pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a "V"
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that Mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Clearly I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

Try to forget this (Try to forget this)
Try to erase this (Try to erase this)
From the blackboard

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away (Ooh)
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneelin'
Lookin' through the paper, though he doesn't know to read, ooh, yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey
