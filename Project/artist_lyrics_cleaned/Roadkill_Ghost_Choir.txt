No curtain call or bride to be
My ear upon the heart of Babylon
Quiet now they speak to me
I deny my lungs to breathe
A thoughtless gasp
A freedom left unseen
Stop moving
Towards that perfect sound
There's blood in the mouths
Of American hounds
Stop moving
The sky will fall
Again
A blow to the head
The universe cannot contain
Its laughter at the sounds we make
Erase the tapes
Repeating echoes
I am burning cheap guitars
Writing songs that do no harm
Don't talk me down
I'm tryin to see the stars
Stop moving
Towards that perfect sound
There's blood in the mouths
Of American hounds
Stop moving
The sky will fall
Again
Stop losing
Let the kids catch fire
Convene on the scene
Like a gun for hire
Stop losing
The walls are closing in
A blow to the head
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Start runnin
Confusing words that lack ourselves
A golden voice repeats them back
I am tired and do not wish to singYou might also
