Way on down to southern Alabama
With the guitars jammin', that's where we're headed
Straight up to Butte, Montana
Singin', "Lord, I was born a ramblin' man"
California to Oregon
Even New York City got one or two hillbillies
Ready to hit the road

It's a brother and a sister kind of thang
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with

Me and my gang
We live to ride
We ride to live
Me and my gang
Jump on that train
Grab hold of them reins
We gonna rock this thang, cock this thang
Me and my gang, yeah

We got hippies, gypsies, freaks and geeks
High-class women in Daisy Duke denim
Bangin' on gongs and singin' our songs
Dude named Elrod jammin' on an iPod
Beer and bonfires
And wide-open throttle, Coors in a bottle
It's all for one and one for all, y'all

Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with

Grab hold of them reins, 

The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later

Why wait another minute
For something we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby, I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle
Girl, it just so happens, that ring that you wanted
Well guess what, I bought it
It's in my pocket baby, come on

Let's do something crazy
'Cause crazy's what you make me

Why wait another minute
Wait another minute, c'mon
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait
What do you say girl we do something 

I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a "hey"
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo

I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up

Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Yeah, yeah are you ready
For some summer nights
Yeah, baby
Summer nights
It's summer nights
Come 

Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowin' that forever, you're all mine

The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again

That every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

Yes, he did

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’

But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone

I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
