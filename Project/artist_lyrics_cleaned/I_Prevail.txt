Guess what?
For the record, you're the broken one
Tried to sing along, but we got stuck
So we turn it over and over again
But now
A thousand scratches on the song we held
A million cuts finally wore it down
Couldn't turn it over and over again
Turn it over and over again

This'll be the last time that I spin our life, never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
I'm not the song you want in your head
This'll be the last time that I spin our life, never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head
Stuck in your head

Guess what?
Didn't wanna have to write these words
Now you're on the other side reversed
Never turning over and over again
So now
I'll turn it off 'cause it's so damn loud
All your lies finally wore me down
You can skip our track 'cause I'm not coming back

You made me sick, round and round again
So I'm turning you off, and I'm trading you in
Sick, so sick again
Now I'm turning you off, and I'm trading you in

Try to tear us apart, but know that we'll wear our scars

Excuses, excuses are all that I hear
All I can see when I look in the mirror
I can't escape all these thoughts in my mind
They're waiting to haunt me night after night
I feel it in my bones, and everything I know
It's underneath my skin, and it won't let go
They know me all too well, but only time will tell
If this is who I am, do I know myself?

Don't forget your life's your own, don't ever let it go

In the heat of the moment when fear has you frozen
You're crashing and burning when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
They can cut us, but we'll wear our scars

You're crashing and burning when life's at its coldest
Don't fall too far from who you are
Try to tear us apart, but know that we'll wear our scars

It's underneath my skin, but I won't let go

Don't forget your life's your own, don't ever let it go

Don't fall too far from who you are
Try to tear us apart, but know that we'll wear our scars

You can cut us up, but we will survive
You had your chance, now it's our time to stand up and rise
We will survive
Right now, the tables turn
We're gonna scream it out loud and let our voices be heard
In the heat of the moment when fear has you frozen
You're crashing and burning when life's at its coldest
