Losin' my inhibitions, call it my intuitions
Somethin's goin' on if I'm feelin' not superstitious
I'm vicious, I'm trapped inside the paradox
Where my thoughts get twisted like some dredlocks
I never, or ever wondered about the voodoo
I sing the voodoo and now my deepest fears is comin' true
I never loved you but I hate you, oww
How could I love you how because I hate you now
So wonder, I'll take you under with the Wicketness
And with the Wicketness, I'll make a preacher slit his fuckin' wrist
No comin' near me when I'm thinkin' this 'cause when I'm thinkin' this
I'm thinkin' Suicidalist, uhh, so back up off me, bust a brain cell
I bust a brain cell, I fall asleep and dream about Hell
Some wonder why I'm even callin' y'all
The sky is fallin' y'all, but after all is my deepest fear

(Morty) Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Morty) How you gon' hide from the fears inside

Chemical dependency, suicidal tendencies
Brain on melt down, street lobotomy
Claustrophobia, locked in a pine box
Now I lay me down to sleep, six feet deep, closed casket
Just another basket case, not a mannequin
But a mad man, so you're panickin'
Run from it, everybody scared, so you're callin' out
Buckshot, shotgun blast, now you're fallin' out
Everybody hide from the deepest fears inside
Watch me and my man Morty take you on a murder ride
Suicide, Symptoms of Insanity, I'm blackin' out
Polly want a cracker but I'm never ever crackin' out
Call me Dr. Frankenstein, dead bodies stinkin', I'm
Gonna get with you, when I hit ya I'ma slit ya
Nobody can hold me, I'm goin' to say this clear
Buried alive in a pine box is my deepest fear

Morty's coming! Morty's coming!
Morty's coming! Morty's coming!
Morty!

(Morty) Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Morty) How you gon' hide from the fears inside

Tell me all deepest fear
Tell me all deepest fear

It's ever so clear, my deepest fear is to hear the screams
The sounds of a madman, embodied in Morty's Theme
I dream and nightmares come true, simply voodoo
Hallucinatin' visions of killin' you
The thought of even thinkin' that I think I need a shrink
In fact I think I need some therapy
'Cause ain't nobody helpin' me
Since I got no excuses for mental abuses
I'm losin' faith, my only fear is to love instead of hate you
Born and bred, born dead, my mind bled
Every time the Holy Bible was read
Instead I lost consciousness and wound up with wicket ways
Think about voodoo dolls, runnin' wild, my last days
Spent with Morty, my shorty, no ventriloquist
Esham the Unholy, straight Suicidalist
(Morty) Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Morty) How you gon' hide from the fears inside

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to
