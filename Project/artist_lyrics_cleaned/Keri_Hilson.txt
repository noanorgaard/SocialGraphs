You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause, boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes, love comes around

And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

So, please, don't mess up the trick
"Hey Young World," I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
