I knew you before the west was won
And I heard you say the past was much more fun
You go your way, I go mine
But I'll see you next time

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) It's all been done
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) It's all been done
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) It's all been done before

And if I put my fingers here
And if I say, "I love you, dear"
And if I play the same three chords
Will you just yawn and say, "Ah, I hate it"?

Alone and bored on a thirtieth-century night
Will I see you on The Price Is Right?
Will I cry, will I smile
As you run down the aisle?

If I had a million dollars (I'd build a tree fort in our yard)
If I had a million dollars (You could help, it wouldn't be that hard)
If I had a million dollars (Maybe we could put a little tiny fridge in there somewhere)

You know, we could just go up there and hang out
(Like open the fridge and stuff
And there'd all be foods laid out for us
Like little pre-wrapped sausages and things) Mmm
(They have pre-wrapped sausages, but they don’t have pre-wrapped bacon)
Well, can you blame 'em?
(Yeah!)

If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
Well, I'd buy you a fur coat (But not a real fur coat, that's cruel)
And if I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
Well, I'd buy you an exotic pet (Yep, like a llama or an emu)
And if I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
Well, I'd buy John Merrick's remains (Ooh, all them crazy elephant bones)
And if I had a million dollars, I'd buy your love

But we would eat Kraft dinner

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry


Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on, we're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gonna get in tune with Sailor Moon 'cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes that make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say "Wasabi"
