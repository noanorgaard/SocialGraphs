Father says "Your mother's right, she's really up on things
Before we married, Mommy served in the WACs in the Philippines"
Now I had heard the WACs recruited old maids for the war
But Mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, hey, hey

Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad are rollin' on the couch
Rollin' numbers, rock and rollin', got my KISS records out

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, hey, hey

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'd shine up the old brown shoes, I'd put on a brand-new shirt
I'd get home early from work if you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?

I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
