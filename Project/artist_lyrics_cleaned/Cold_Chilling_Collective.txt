Ay, cuz, this shit on?

My life the fuckin' business, in here collectin' digits
This shit could get explicit, got a sweet tooth for these bitches
Yeah, burnin' through these meal tickets
Shit could get wicked (Mic check)
Lights, camera, action
Slow burn, no crash
Now that's a lot of ashes
The fuckin' main attraction

Let's get this shit in order, I am the top of the totem
Time to reload and we blowin' the smoke out your modem (Come on)
Come get in closer, yeah I know you smellin' that aroma
Household name on every motherfuckin' corner
Ring-ding-ding, she fuck me right then I'm a goner
Ting ting, then we toast into this marijuana
Now how many licks does it take
Just to get to the center of a cupcake? No time to pump fake

School of hard knocks took the long way
Sick of crooked cops in the pissy hallway
Made it out the hood, now it's Broadway
Y'all motherfuckers better leave them kids alone
You might also like
These niggas can't afford to go to war on a budget (Nah-ah)
Say my name in the wrong sentence and I'ma pull up and touch 'em (Yup)
The repercussion in this bitch, it sound just like a percussion
Have your deep cover, cold case under the rubbish
Yeah, murder was the fuckin' case, that's the killa Cali way
Ricky in the alley way, just another Saturday
Drinkin' gin and juice while these bitches was sippin' Alizé
It's just a matinee, watch me blow a bag a day (Come on)

School of hard knocks took the long way
Sick of crooked cops in the pissy hallway
Made it out the hood, now it's Broadway
Y'all motherfuckers better leave them kids alone

I started out with nothin'
And took this gangsta shit worldwide
You know a nigga always into somethin'
I couldn't even help it if I tried
Now this is fair warning, nigga, final notice
Back outside and movin' on this locomotive
Hot as fuck, but still keepin' a cold shoulder
You outta luck, success the sweetest hangover. Game over (Over, over, over)

Guns on the bed (Yeah)
Aye

Phone on don't do not disturb
Two Chevys in my grandma's driveway, no, this not the burbs
Prescriptions in the medicine cabinet, I got Wock' reserved
Guns on the bed, the chopper mine, the pocket-rocket hers
You actin' nervous around killers, you got a lot of nerve
She wanna slot, I'm at the top, you know that top reserved
You sheddin' blood, that's Murder Inc., your name get hot as Irv
My shooter's quiet on the set, you won't hear not a word (Hush)
Used to give it my all, fuck a minimum wage
Tryna make me a slave, that's how villains are made
Had me feelin' some way, stuck in my feelings some day
Windows get tinted Sunday, pillage the village Monday
Just another day at work (Uh)
Feelin' like I'm on the verge
Get the urge to wanna purge
Shit get deep, spoken word
Met this bitch in Sherman Oaks, I bet she fuck with Sherm
Smokey in a pigeon coop, look like she ducking worm
Baby daddy on her back, every time I bust a turn
Bitch keep lookin' right to left, that shit not my concern
On Long Beach Boulevard until I get to 23rd
Put us in the jungle, we leavin' out that bitch in furs
I'm talkin' his and hers, DA tryna switch his words
Murder was the case, but you know what the witness heard (Nothing)
Nigga bumped his head, musta hit a nerve
Scratches on a statement like the Forgiatos hit a curb
I see you for what you is with my vision blurred
Don't make a nigga sign off on this hit without a signature
You know this shit could get ugly as Forest Whitaker
Make your bones chillin', you feelin' all in your fibula
I be home gettin' my dick sucked with the semi-tucked
Frequently knee-deep in some pussy and still don't give a fuck
Girls with that big fish tryna connect some
Parking lot pimpin', tryna collect some
Too rich to make poor decisions
Too many die for attention
They prey on you, no religion
Don't let 'em play with you, might have to kill some
Niggas that change on you, pop, career done
And then them chains on you, locked in prison

A nigga out there movin' right (Uh)
The shit you bitches do for
