I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey

Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

She said, "It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade"
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sign up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all all is good and nothingness is dead
Well, runnin' til she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

When you're walking through a crowded space
I hear every word being said
I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, you
How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open space
When I feel I'm slipping further away
Where I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, you, to you, you
These are the days that I won't get back
I won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
But when it's quiet and I don't hear a thing
Well I can always hear you breathe
You know there's nowhere else I've wanted to be
Than be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember that when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you, you, to you, you
You know there's nowhere else I've wanted to be
Than be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember that when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to youYou might also
