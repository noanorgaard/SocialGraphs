Just leave it all
Look, you'll be fine
Spend your life tryna be a ten when that ten ain't worth a dime
They can teach you to catch his eye, I'mma teach you to catch his heart
Cause if you catch his heart you will always have his eye
But you'll always be a bride, you will always be desired
You're a masterpiece, not a piece to be mastered, your master
You are not a side, your the Master's piece
That makes you flawless, flawless
Regardless, you're a loved woman
Who taught you to hate your skin?
Who taught you to hate your lips?
Who taught you, huh?
Who saw you and made you live?
Who sought you and made you His?

Your fantasy of being noticed is already a reality
Wake up
