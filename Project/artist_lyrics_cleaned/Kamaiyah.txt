I've been broke all my life
Now wonder
How does it feel to be rich?
How does it feel to be rich?
I done worked all my life
Now wonder
How does it feel to just live?

Everybody want money, want the fame and the clothes
Everybody losin' friends, people change when they grow
To be known in the game, I've been waiting too long
Spit fire, spit flames and I came for the throne
Told 'em once, told 'em twice, this just ain't what they want
Their speak is discrete and they hate on the low
If hate's all you know, your face gotta go
I aim for a change, you stagnant, the same
Every day, all day, young and swangin' my chain
Aw shit, drink champagne 'til I can't
Aw quit, start the waves that you take
Steal our swag and our name, but you can't be the gang
Foreign whips when we swang, BMG do our thang
Aw shit, it's Kamaiyah
Aw shit, please retire
Hot girl set the city on fire

Remember when I didn't have cash for the rent?
Now I'm loafed up getting cash in advance
I own it and don't lease it
I don't have to finance
Superstar, Put the world in a trance at a glance
Cause I know I was made for this
I'm just getting to the cash I was made to get
This is the life I was made to live
From the bottom to the top of your favorite list
Tell me how does it feel to be rich
To pull up, hop out of the flyest of whips
How does it feel to just live
I put out a song and my life changed for real

Aw shit, no more nights starving
I believed in me all year and came out on top balling
Oooh

Remember when I didn't have shoe strings
Now I pull up, hop out, watch that coup swing
Big money, get money, we do things
Now I, get everything I want
Buy everything I saw
When I had nothing at all
Fuck it, I got it, I'm on
I'm on

Put your mind to this shit and it'll happen
I grew up in the slums, wasn't raised up in a mansion
Days full of hurt, I was sad
Pallet on the floor
No pads for the mattress
Music was my answer to the madness
I say I gotta do this, so I focused on the rapping
Father was on drugs was my daddy
Mama ain't around
Black queen, but I'm damaged
This is the life that I came from
Struggling, hurting, and anger
But I stayed down with my day ones
God made a way and I came up
Aw shit, no more nights starving
I believed in me all year and came out on top balling
Oooh

Remember when I didn't have shoe strings
Now I pull up, hop out, watch that coup swing
Big money, get money, we do things
