Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee require skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin', and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, The Fifth thumpin'
Keepin' your party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, "Yo, we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you — you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but, um..

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
A-yo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world, crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb, and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to..

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short — "I want It Made" like Ed, 'nuff said!
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to..
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they 

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour and peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like that shit don't matter, when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever, let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly, 'round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, they keep tellin' me, tellin' me, yo

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight (Uh-huh)
And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old "Another lonely night?"
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you, I'm stayin', boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?
Is you crazy? You my king, for real
But sometimes, relationships get ill, no doubt

That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', "She tryna play you for the fool, Black"
If something's on your chest, then let it be known (Right)
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite backs and fracture what's intact
And there'll forever be (Right), I ain't on some, "Oh, I'm a celebrity"
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds (Caught in love like whirlwinds)
Listenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends (Right, they're listenin' to girlfriends)
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where the drama begins, and she like, yo
