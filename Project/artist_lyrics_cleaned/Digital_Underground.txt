People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'"
That's alright 'cause I get things cookin'
You stare, you glare, you constantly try to compare me
But you can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls, they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
'Cause in a 69, my humpty nose will tickle your rear
My nose is big, uh-uh, I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, you know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I'll shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothing like, "Looptid"
I sang on, "Doowutchyalike," and if you missed it
I'm the one who said, "Just grab 'em in the biscuits"
Also told you that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All you had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Come on, yeah, sexy lady)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on, uh), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy baby, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Uh)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what we're doing? We're doing the Humpty Hump, y'all, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Watch me), do the Humpty Hump

Ah yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let a little bit of that bass groove right here
Err-rear, der-rit, err-rear, der-rit
Ah, yeah
Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself
Let me tell you a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

First I limp to the side like my legs was broken
Shaking and twitching kind of like I was smoking
Crazy, whack, funky
People say, "You look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty"
That's alright 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
You got it down when you appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin'
Gig around, shaking your rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stunt
Tell him, "Step off, I'm doing the Hump"
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Everybody, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy lady, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what I'm doing? We're doing the Humpty Hump, y'all, uh, watch me)
Do the Humpty Hump (Uh), do the Humpty Hump (Yo, yo, Black people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Come on, white people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Puerto Ricans)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Just keep on doing the Hump, Samoans)
Do the Humpty Hump (Do the), do the Humpty Hump

Ah, yeah
Let's get stupid (Give me the music)
Uh

Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Give me— Give me the music, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Uh, give me— Give me the music)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump  (Give me— Give me the music)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what we're doing? Doing the Humpty Hump)

Ah, yeah
Go on and break it down
Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, sexy lady
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace and Humptiness
