Embers arising, smoke fills the skies in
Wind blows in then crashes, waves over the ashes
Hills washed up in violet, eyes close up to hide it

I want to feel that you want it
I want to feel by the morning

I want to feel that you want it
Oh, let me feel what you are

Growing and rising, rain fills the skies in
Sunday morning crashes, flickering of lashes

I'm cold in the river, lips moving, there's no sound
Pulling me under, I'm under, mmm
You've given me nothing, keep telling me I'll be fine
Keeping me guessing, I'm guessing, mmm
