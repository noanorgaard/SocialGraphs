Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad

But, shit, it's all good

Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party

Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up

Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one-hunnid
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out"

Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess"
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through

Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well, if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire

It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press

Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only twenty-seven and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Been a minute since we've slept together
Better get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault, girl, 'cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I'm lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody's yacht, that you didn't buy
You're young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
'Cause fuck it, I'm not here to judge

All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history

Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it

Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?

Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I'd done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it, ah

Uh, one thing 'bout music, when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now

It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it

When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey

And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this

And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you

Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened

I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together

I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to

You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers

And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
"Someone Like You," more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the 

Hermès link, ice-blue mink (Woo)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is (Yah)
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo)

Yeah, October Firm in the cut (Yah)
Stay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax (Ha, ha, ha)
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (Yah)
Virginia Black (Doo-doo)
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts (Facts, nigga, yah)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah)

Hermès link (Woo, woo), ice-blue mink (Yah)

They want me gone, out of the picture (Yah)

I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through (Yah)
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of six
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I 

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—
Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
