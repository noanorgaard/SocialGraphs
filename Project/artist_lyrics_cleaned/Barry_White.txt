My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're you're all I'm living for
Your love, I'll keep forevermore
(You're the first) You're the first (The last), you're the last, my everything

In you, I found so many things
A love so new only you could bring

It's like the more you give, the more I want and, baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe, tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Somethin' moves, I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'
