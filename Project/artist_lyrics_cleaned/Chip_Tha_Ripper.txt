Verse 2
Comin’ to you live
From a jungle full of pride
And drugs
Many lives taken from under these lights
With them Nike Air Flights
Been rollin’ up plenty nights
Was a whole lot of shots
And not too many fights
I was young, keepin’ up
With the niggas who was hatin’
Ain’t nobody gave us nathin’
Nigga we just had to take it naw
Little Stace got 38
Better smartin’ up
Lil’ Jon goin’ off
Yea we got some problems but
Prayin’ ask the Lord to stay
With you just another day
And if I die before I wake
Tell my niggas split my cake
Yea and just like 50 say
Cuz I can’t take it anyway
We livin’ in a different day than yesterday
And shit today
So what I gotta get today
Is paper in a different way
Condo fuck a crib
Cuz hey a window just a brick away?
Followed by, me fill in the blank
While I just stottle by
Up at 2 and 6?
I’m ‘bout to catch a flight to na na na
