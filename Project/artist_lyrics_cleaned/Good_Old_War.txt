I know everyone would want me to say
That I'm not afraid to be alone

I'm gonna live, I'm alright
I'm gonna die, it's alright, I'm okay
Li-di-di
I'm gonna live, I'm alright
I'm gonna die, it's alright, I'm okay
Li-di-di

There's a place in my head
That must be called the Super Motel
I can stay the whole night
And think about the girl in her shell

I know everyone would want me to say
That I'm not afraid to be alone

I can't let this go I'm on my way
And you can only hold my diamond ring
I go crawling back to the city I love
'Cause it's already taken everything

I'm going to Coney Island to have myself a dog
And reminisce why I still hate it here
It's all these people with their cotton candy eyes
It's so sweet now put the train in gear

I can't let this go I'm on my way
And you can only hold my diamond ring
I go crawling back to the city I love
'Cause it's already taken everything

The ground is swallowing my options for release
And if it rains they might just disappear
I counted twenty-seven birds up there today
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here
I'm thinking that's why I still love it here

Oh sometimes I try to think that you are something I don't need
I try to tell myself you're gone if it's the day before you leave
And I'm sure that you'd come back if I could offer you some change
I'd have to promise you
But I can't promise you
I'm sure you'll have some big plans if I just go
Move to the west coast, see something else for once

Oh sometimes I try to think that you are something I don't need
I try to tell myself you're gone if it's the day before you leave
And I'm sure that you'd come back if I could offer you some change
I'd have to promise you
But I can't promise you
Over and over
It hasn't worked so you're better off alone
