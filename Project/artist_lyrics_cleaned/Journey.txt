Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire

They are seeing through the promises
And all the lies they dare to tell
Is it heaven or hell?
They know very well

Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side

So now, I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

I need you to stay

If you can see how you imagine your life
You want to dream now and you know that anything is possible
It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible

Take it brick by brick, throw away the stone
Take a chance on something, build a castle you call home
Live for the moment, you cannot put into words
Don't keep a song inside, let your voice be heard
Find your true desire, don't be afraid to cry
Better to reach for something, than to never have tried

It's time to see how you imagine your life
You want to dream, you know that anything is possible
It's not who you are, it's where you want to go
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible

Winter is here again, oh, Lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh, I've been runnin' down this dusty road

Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it before too long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm standing in the sleet and rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The morning sun is risin', it's kissin' the day

Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line, it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours
Faithfully

Circus life under the big-top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wonderin' where I am lost without you

And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you

Feeling that it's gone
Can't change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide
Love divides

Someday, love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
