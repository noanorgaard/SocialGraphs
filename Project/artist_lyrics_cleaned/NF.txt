My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house (Hey)

All I see is green lights (Woo)
All I see is green lights (Oh)
All I spit is real life (Ayy)
Bet you don't know what that's like, ah
All I see is green lights (Yeah)
Woo, all I see is green lights (Woo)
Yeah, all I spit is real life
I bet you don't know (Yeah) what that's (Ahh) like (Ayy)

I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average"
He asked me, "What does that mean?"
I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please"
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time (Ohh, ayy)

All I see is green lights (Yeah, woo)
All I see is green lights (Haha)
All I spit is real life (Real life)
Bet you don't know what that's like (You don't know)
All I see is green lights (Green lights, woo)
All I see is green lights (Green lights, haha)
All I spit is real life (Oh)
I bet you don't know what that's like (No, ayy)

Faith is somethin' I am not accustomed to
And trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tough when
Really, my shoulders, they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me? You said you've always got your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own, so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin, but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to You, let You into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is Your direction
I know, I've told You I do not need Your protection
But I lied to You, this thing is tiring
And man was not created for it, God, please retire me now

Oh these hands are tired, oh, this heart is tired
Oh, this soul is tired, but I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on

Yeah, trust is something I am not accustomed to
And I know the Bible says that I should always trust in You
But I don't never read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest, please take this out of my hands
I have no control, I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity You've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole if You are not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in Your eyes, it's amazing

Oh, these hands are tired, oh, this heart is tired
Oh, this soul is tired, but I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on

Woah, woah, oh, woah, woah, oh, woah, woah, oh
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
Woah, woah, oh, woah, woah, oh, woah, woah, oh
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
Woah, woah, oh, woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, oh, I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep 

Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see it
These walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't burn down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
Inside this mansion

Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in pain
See, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, "I wish I could change"
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller it seems
Moment I walk into, it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
One of the first things I wrote was, "I wish I woulda called"
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watching these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm going, they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
Inside this mansion

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside, so stop watching
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the world out ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore
It's lonely
Inside
Inside
It's lonely
It's lonely
Oh, yeah, it's lonely
Inside this 

You're the only one, only one, nothing's gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through, we've been through some things
But it's okay, okay, there is no way
I'm leaving, baby, believe it

I put my hand into yours and, baby, I knew
That you would be there no matter what we go through
You're not alone, I'll always be there for you
'Cause you're the one for me, you're the one for me

You're the only one, only one, nothing's gonna hold us up

I'm hoping and wishing that things would be different
I don't wanna lose you, I know that I'll miss this
'Cause you're the only one on my mind that listened
