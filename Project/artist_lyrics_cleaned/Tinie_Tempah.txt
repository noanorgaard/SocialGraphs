Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way

Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrrrraps, brrrrrraps
Son I’m like a young and fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ohhhh
The seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way!

Eenie meanie minie
Thank God it's Friday
Please don't ask me for my I'd
If I'm in your iTunes library
Got my own book in my library
My mansion is so tidy
My neighbours hate my mistress cause she never wear no nighties
I go Claridges to do high tea
Jordan's on like Spike Lee
I'm high end, you're high street
Swagger jacking my stylee
When I was a kid I used to save up for my Nikes
Now all these little kids is try'na save up for my Nikes
Go
Shake
Tamborine
Jump
Trampoline
Sharing clothes, that's trampy
Splitting bills, that's trampy
All this hanky panky, now her hand prints on my Banksy
I'm just strictly speaking, Anne Frankly
All my girls is fancy
In a white Ferrari Spider
Rollung with Anansi, Diplo to disco
She sniff woah
She gwan like she Ri Ri
Wine to Calypso
She ask me if I'm single
I said "maybe, I think so
I can't concentrate, when that thong's on like Sisqo"
First of all I'm swagging
Two girls with me so I'm bragging
So much money in my pocket
My pants might be sagging
My car might be tinted
My weed might be scented
My girl might be bow legged
Her friend might be with her
Gold Roley on when I perform
Ring ring -- Mobile Phone
The way it's going off
It must be on
Till the break of dawn, party like rock stars
We don't stop till we see the fucking cop cars
Shake
Tambourine
Tan 'til her skin peel off, tangerine
Then she vogue
Agyness Deyn
On your marks get set go (red, amber, green)
Sydney, what's going down
New York, what's going down
LA, what's going down
Vegas, what's going down
Dublin, what's going down
Paris, what's going down
Lagos, what's going down
Oslo, what's going down
Toronto, what's going down
