While my friends were getting high and chasing girls
Down parkway lines, I was losing my mind
Because the love, the love, the love, the love
The love that I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear, I put a helmet on, a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
So now I'm standing on the overpass
Screaming at the cars, "Hey, I wanna get better"

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen-year-old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger

And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away
So now I'm staring at the interstate
Screaming at myself, "Hey, I wanna get better"

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til i wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get

Better
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better

So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crashed my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
That's why I'm standing on the overpass
Screaming at myself, "Hey, I wanna get better"

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get 

So come a little closer
There is something I can tell, yeah
You are such a rollercoaster
And a killer queen you are

Rollercoaster, I don't say no
Rollercoaster when you don't say no
Oh, and it's such a rollercoaster
Some killer queen you are

We took the bones out from the road
Those endless nights that we traveled, we stole
You let your clothes fall to the floor
And lit a fire while I waited for more
Now I'm running and I won't stop, I don't wanna go
I think about it every day and night, I can't let go
And, hey, I'm never the same
It's a hundred miles an hour on a dirt road running away

But we fight, stay up late
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby, loving you got me runaway)

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want, don't take the money
Don't take the money

I slept on my own those nights
Was still in my parents' house
And I cut off my T-shirt sleeves
And claim a new continent
'Til I saw your face and hands
Covered in sun and then
I think I understand
Well, I understand

But we fight, stay up late
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shake my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(Baby, loving you got me runaway)

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want, don't take the money
Don't take the money

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want, don't take the money
Don't take the money
(Baby, loving you got me runaway)
When you're looking at your shadow
Standing on the edge of yourself
Praying on the darkness
Just don't take the money
Dreaming of it easy
Waking up without weight now
And you're looking at the heartless
Just don't take the money

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want, don't take the money
Well, don't take the money

You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want, don't take the money
Don't take the money

Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money (Don't take the money)
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money

Because I lied to you, I lied to you
I lied to your face in the summer, your face in the summer
You had long hair then (You had long hair then)
(I'm coming back from the dead)

I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (Oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (Oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I'm watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon (Dream far away)

Woke up in the corner store, someone saying my name
Everybody moving around, acting like nothing had changed
But something had changed in me (Oh, she touched me)
Yeah, she touched me, said, "I know you're not to blame" (Dream far away)
What a weight to live under, what a lie that's been covered
I'm talking about (I'm a comedian) rolling thunder
I know I left you on the street last night
So I'm holding on, grabbing at a light

How come I lied to you? I lied to you
I lied to your face in the summer, your face in the summer
I had my hair short then (I had my hair short then)
(I'm coming back from the dead)

I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (Oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (Oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I'm watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon (Dream far away)
I know it's always been you
You just gotta get home soon
I'm coming for you, ooh
It's always been you
I just gotta get home soon,
