Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart, but not

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

You might also like
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

So swallow all your tears, my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose
If you don't run the race, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
