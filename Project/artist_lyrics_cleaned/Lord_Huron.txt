I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh

Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trail, but I cannot fail; I will find her

(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

She left no trace, but I know her face; I will find her

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh

When last I saw her, she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then; I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go
And if she leaves it, I will follow, I will follow

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin', why, I'm a-wanderin'
Not while we're both still alive

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm going alone

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well, if you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee

I was a-ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' the life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die, but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone
