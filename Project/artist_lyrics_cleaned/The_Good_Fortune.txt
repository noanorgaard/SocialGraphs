High, my eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
High and I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going back

Was all just a haze?
My hands were dirty
As I started to remember my name
So I stumbled and crawled
I prayed to God
To let me live through it all
And then I watched myself fall
Fall further than I ever have before
See I knew it all
I thought I knew, knew it all
Oh god I thought knew it all

High, my eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
High and I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going back
High, my eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
High and I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going back
High, my eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
High and I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going back
High, my eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
My eyes were turning black
High and I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going
