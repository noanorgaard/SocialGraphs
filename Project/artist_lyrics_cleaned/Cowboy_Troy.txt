Hey, here we go, fill em on up
Mason jars and solo cups
Drinkin like a fish at the bottom of a roll
190 proof and I like it ice cold
You talk less here I'm big john shine
She cobeago batsi homemade wine
Them southern gals shake it and bounce it back
Man pour another round lets drink to that

And all you southern belles

Cause tonight were raisin hell
EVERYBODY LETS CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG
