Passion burning, causing rapture of laughter
Pressure building, falling faster and faster
If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you, darling, I got you

Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Chapters turning, so old fashioned and natural
Potions got me falling for you, oh yeah
Baby if I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word
And I got and more
