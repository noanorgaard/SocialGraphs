There’s a universe inside of you

If I color you with all my thoughts
Would you lose your fears of being lost?
I bet you never even knew
I see the universe inside of you
Can I make you feel okay?
Would you let me take you to a higher place?
No no no no, I bet you never knew

I can make you feel

I can make you feel alright

Breathe, breathe me in, taste my words
Let me blow your mind
I'll take you far, far away
I’ll make you feel alright
You’ve gotta crave it and chase it
Until you’re close enough to taste it
I can give you what you need
I can give you what you need

You looked at me with certainty
I, I couldn't look away
Took your jacket off like
Like you were here to stay
Chasin' your pretty thoughts
And your plastic love
There goes my mind
It's going, going
Gone

You're that lace trimmed danger
One day you'll be the face of a stranger
Stranger, stranger
Cause don't you know?
Nothing but 'cha stays the same
Don't you know?
Nothing but change stays the same

(But I like that a)

In intervals you’re sinkin' in
You’re sinkin' in my soul
Thought to myself:
“Don't, don't you lose control”
Started to undress you, with my wandering eyes
Told myself you'd be gone by sunrise cause

Don't look back, just

I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
I could be your fantasy
(Anything could happen, anything could happen)
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
Listen to the waves

So you say you wanna get so high
Breathe me in like air tonight
Let yourself unwind, get lost
In the garden of my mind
I could be your private island
Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain
