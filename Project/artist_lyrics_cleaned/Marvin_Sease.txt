Fuck a party I'm just tryna get rich
Scratch another model bitch off of my list
4AM and shes beggin' me to hit
Shes gonna suck and I'm gonna lick
I'm on the freeway racin'
My boy say he got the bag that I been chasin'
Atleast three hundred bands in Ben Franklin's
Any sucka cross my path I'ma spank him
I pray to god that don't none of these niggas knock me off
I pray to god that I keep learnin' lessons like a boss
I thank god that he keep me motivatin' my hood
I pray to god that he keep me lookin' good

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood
I'm too sexy for a dusty ass bitch
Gettin loaded ridin' 'round in my vette (Vroom)
You don't fuck with me 'cause you know you can't
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood
I'm too sexy for a dusty ass bitch
Gettin loaded ridin' 'round in my vette (Vroom)
You don't fuck with me 'cause you know you can't
