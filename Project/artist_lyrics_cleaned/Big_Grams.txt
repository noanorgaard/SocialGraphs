Forever and always, always together
Like salt and pepper
We live life like a love letter
Real nice like them love letters
Amen tell 'em
I stole her heart like a known felon
Jackpot couldn't have chose better
Banana dick on deck, she goes gorilla
If you ain't got yours yet, the boy gonna get her, for real
On the phone with her til the wee hours
Future's so bright, who can see ours?
Usin' all three eyes to get between thighs
Always overstood, never undermined

Spoon action, gravy for the cuddle time
And under the cover we make another Twan
Fuck it, make another one

No matter what you say to me you'll always be a goldmine junkie
(One more drill)
No matter what I do to break your heart, I know you'll always love me

Always is the plan right? (Damn right)
Huge ring? (Damn right)
I deserve it, I'm worth it
Besides you fit perfect
But that's our secret, can you keep it?
I'm a junkie for you when you need it
When you leave the feelings you leave me with
(I'm knee deep in it), I'm knee deep in it

Overdosin' off devotion, we can never get lonely
The only one that can do somethin' for me totally mind blowing
And I never letting go, these streets ain't got nothing for me
It's full of skeezers and phonies, bloodsuckin' leeches that owe me, homie

He's a guy, give him one more try, I'm listenin'
Through your eyes I can read your mind, it's blisterin'
Every time you say one more drill
I gotta dig myself out of the way I feel
And now the gold is really coal and sparklin'
Take me down where shooting stars are flatlinin'
Every time you say one more drill
I gotta dig myself out of the way I feel
'Cause I need you

I'm just a cool ass nigga, put Atlanta on the map
I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back
I bust the sun roof open, beams hit the Braves cap
Call me Chief Noc-A-Homa, you can't beat it with a bat
Droppin' bombs, atomic, dog I could never chase the cat
Keep the spotlight on me, it will never fade to black
If I speak it then I mean it, I will never take it back
My demeanor's like a king, I'm leavin' niggas in the trap

Melting the ice
We fell in the sun, love
Ain't no surprise
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the sun, love

Once upon a time there was a boy named Daddy Fat
Heard he grew into a man and put his family on his back
Had a master plan, Da Vinci code, nobody couldn't crack
Even though when times got difficult, he kept on slangin' rap

And not the regular unleaded or the mid, we got the pack
We extraterrestrial, extraordinary
In the center of your solar system, shinin' on the daily

We fell in the sun, love
Ain't no surprise
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the sun, love

Shine like a second at the sun, but it's too hot
Don't matter where you're from, lose your cool now
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York

Shine like a second at the sun, but it's too hot
It don't matter where you're from, lose your cool now
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York

Oh yeah
Talk about a Vitamin D overdose
And I do mean D
Melting the ice
We fell in the sun, love
Ain't no surprise
