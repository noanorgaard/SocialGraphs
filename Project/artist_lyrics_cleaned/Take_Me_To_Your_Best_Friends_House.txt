Whoa

Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
(Don't)
(Break!)

Oh! Take me to your best friend's house
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
Oh! Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't...
Brake!

One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party, pillow fight
My eyes and your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats 'til beddy-bye

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
(Don't take me tongue tied)
(Don't kiss me goodnight)

Don't...
Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' around this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh! Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't leave, no)
Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)
Don't...
Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't leave, no)

Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)
Don't...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah...
