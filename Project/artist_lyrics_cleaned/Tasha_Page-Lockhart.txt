But there's not a hole too deep, naw
That God won't reach down and save me, me
See He cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you, hey!

I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the Savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Now I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met King Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
'Cause I'm different
You might also like
I'm human, I'm gon' make mistakes
If and when I do please show me some grace
'Cause though it may be me who messed up today...
It may be your turn tomorrow
Then I bet you'll say
Something different
'Cause what goes around comes back around
Those you hurt on the way up
Will be there when you're down, down
I used to be the same way
But one Sunday morning something in my heart changed

I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the Savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Now I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met King Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
'Cause I'm different
But there's not a hole too deep, naw
That God won't reach down and save me
See He cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you

You can see it (I'm different)
In my walk (Different)
Others see it (Different)
In how I talk (How I'm different)
I can see it (Different)
In how I pray (Different)
I start to shed some tears (Different)
Each word I say (See I'm different)
They tell me (I'm different)
Like day and night (Different)
I used to go off quick (Different)
I'd cuss and fight (But now I'm different)
I'd blame everyone else (Different)
For my mistakes (I was different)
If someone got too close (Different)
I'd push away (But now I'm different)
But then Jesus (Different)
Came in my life (Different)
Saw my potential (Different)
And made it right (See I'm different)
Not just religion (Different)
But something real (Different)
It's what I know now (Different)
Not what I feel (Different)
You can't tell it (Different)
Like I can (Different)
Look at me (Different)
I'm born again (Different)
It wasn't easy (Different)
What I've been through (Different)
I'm stronger now (Different)
Now I can help you (Different)
You'll be different (Different)
Oh, yeah (Different)
I'm different (Different)
Different (Different)
Look at me (Different)
Oo-oo-oo-ooh (Different)
Different (Different)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh (
1 ContributorYours Lyrics
I feel like chasing the sun
It's been a while since Your light shined down on me
See, I feel You're that One
Who makes broken people better than they used to be

But it's all or nothing with You
You won't share my heart so I
I can do 

Jesus I'm Yours
Can't even deny it, I'm Yours
When I try to hide it of course
People still can see that I'm Yours
Jesus I'm Yours
And all the things You have for me in store
I probably couldn't handle it before
Until I totally became Yours
Jesus I'm Yours, Yours

Sometimes I get in my way, ooh
I'm too impatient, I'm my worst enemy
To my surprise there was grace
Shining next to mercy, waiting patiently
You might also like
But it's all or nothing with You
You won't share my heart so I
I can do 

Jesus I'm Yours
Can't even deny it, I'm Yours
When I try to hide it of course
People still can see that I'm Yours
Jesus I'm Yours
And all the things you have for me in store
I probably couldn't handle it before
Until I totally became Yours
Jesus I'm Yours, Yours

It took a while now, for me to see
That Your plan was better (better)
Better for me (ooh na na)
And the key to unlock every door (ooh oh oh)
Is when I finally became Yours
The only thing now, that matters to me, is
Is getting closer, so I can be, be
Be so much better, than I ever was before (I ever was before)
Thank You for making me Yours
It took a while now, for me to see
That Your plan was better, better for me
And, and the key to, to unlock every door
Is when I finally became Yours
The only thing now, that matters to me
Is getting closer, so I can be
So much better, than I ever was before
Thank You for making me Yours

I've been searching and I'm so glad I'm finally Yours
I'm so glad that I finally see that I am Yours
And I thank You
Thank You, ooh
I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours
Thank You,
