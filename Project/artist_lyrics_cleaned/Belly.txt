Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'ma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone
