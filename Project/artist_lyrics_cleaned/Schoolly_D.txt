Well..
Where'd you get that funk from?
Re-program)

Hold up - when a brother get funky
I got you movin like a Schoolly D junkie
I'm in your brain, in your vein like cocaine
I got you movin like a crackhead, insane
Damn right, I ain't nothin but a gangsta
A thief and a criminal, I can't be a prankster
Some say I'm a microphone master
But I say I'm just doin what I has ta
Some rhyme for the brother who likes to think
I rather rhyme for the brother who likes to drink
Keep runnin, keep gunnin, keep 8-Ballin
Some don't like me, but the suckers keep callin
In my face, sayin, "Schoolly-School, man
How'd you ever, ever get so cool, man?
I've never ever seen you play the fool"
Because I use the microphone like a plumber use a tool
Code Money is my left and my right hand man
Make it so funky for the motherland
(Where'd you get that funk from?
Well..

A bomb, a clap, brothers with a dope track
Break it down in a ride, slam, get respect
808 with some power from the vocal tones
Drop your tape, pull a crowd and the party's on
For a moment you ain't with it, then you feel the groove
Grab a girl on the floor, now it's time to prove
You can't hold it, gotta shake it, there's no control
So now I got it for a hour, you feel the soul
Break it down in the town, it's time to clown
So all the homies and the show-me's can jump around
You gotta play it, it's smooth and it's approved
And if you don't pump it up, then get soothed
Follow the flow, rrise above with the track
Kickin the rhymes while they call from the back
Smoke in the crowd, and I know that you're with it
As for the funk, homes, where'd you get it?
(Where'd you get that funk from?
Well..
Where'd you get that funk from?

(Make it funky now)
(Make it funky now)

Get on up and let me say somethin to ya
Never will screw ya, always will school ya
And boo ya, in the back I will do ya
You don't like it, so I step right to ya
Step to this and you're steppin in static
Cause School is a funky Asiatic
And if you think that I never give it to em
One day I meet em, the next day I screw em
And then again with a rhythm, you know I did em
All the boys in the ave, man, you know I'm with em
And if you think that I can't get funky
I got you movin like a Soultrain, funky
To the beat, to the rhyme that's on time
To the brothers on the ave that sip wine
Code Money is my left and my right hand man
Make it real funky for the motherland
(Where'd you get that funk from?

1 ContributorHow A Black Man Feels Lyrics
Plenty niggas known have tried
Plenty motherfuckers died
Plenty niggas known have died...
Commit suicide
Some are no'in
Some are yes'in
Some motherfuckers guessin'
Put a gun up to your head
Listen to the rhymes I said
If you look into our faces
Find out we're no fuckin' racists
If you fail to understand
Here's their motherfuckin' plan
Rob or kill, or steal or blunder
Straight on up we'll put you under
Pullin' hard I keep on thinkin'
Thunderbird the drink I'm drinkin'
Shoot all racists without blinkin'
Motherfuckers like you sinkin'
If you win or if you lose...
Sing thе blues
Give a "fuck off" who we killin'
That's how thе black man feelin'

Motherfuckers on a rampage
A brother with a 12 gauge
No former education
We're fuckin' up the nation
Think about it if you doubt it
Crack cocaine we'll do without it
Some are off it, some are down
So motherfuckers can't be found
Who a second or a minute
Play this game you'll never win it
Sayin' somethin' to the clan
A message you should understand
Put a gun into my hand
Then shot another white man
Give a "fuck off" who we killin'
That's how the black man feelin'
You might also like
Whoever made the work on nig
The same motherfucker pulled the trigger
So I figure I'd be bigger
Motherfuckers shake and shiver
Or (dequiver?) I deliver
Don't (???) like a river
In my days of (CO8?)
'Cause motherfuckers cannot wait
So I debate "am I that great?"
Awaken from my fuckin' fate
Am I in or am I out?
Or do I have some fuckin' clout?
Because my fuckin' skin is black...
What do I lack?
Give a "fuck off" who we killin'
That's how the black man
