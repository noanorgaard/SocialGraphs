So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

Once a life believes it's got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
Rest up, sleepyhead
You might as well be dead

And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

It's just like seeing her for the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out of town, has been hard
But somehow this old heart
Found time to work it out this far
