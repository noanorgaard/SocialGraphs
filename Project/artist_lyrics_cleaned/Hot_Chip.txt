Won't you come down to my arms?
There's something I'm ready to say
Would you call my name?

Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A memory tells us that we're blessed
But opening up this chest
I discovered that a heart is lame
Falling behind what we guess
But trying to do our best
Do we stop, do we stop in frame?

Won't you come back to my heart?
There's something I'm trying to say
Would you call my name?

Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
