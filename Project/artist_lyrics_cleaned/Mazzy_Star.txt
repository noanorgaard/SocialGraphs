Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

I think it's strange you never
