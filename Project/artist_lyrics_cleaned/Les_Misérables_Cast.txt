I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted?

One day more

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started

One more day all on my own

Will we ever meet again?

One more day with him not caring
You might also like
I was born to be with you

What a life I might have known

And I swear I will be true!

But he never saw me there

One more day before the storm
Do I follow where she goes?
At the barricades of Freedom
Shall I join my brothers there?
When our ranks begin to form
Do I stay or do I dare?
Will you take your place with me?

The time is now
The day is here

One day more!
One day more till revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood!

One day more!

Watch them run amuck
Catch'm as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here a little dip
There a little touch
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!

One day to a new beginning
Raise the flag of freedom high!
Every man will be a king
Every man will be a king
There's a new world for the winning
There's a new world to be won
Do you hear the people sing?
My place is here
I fight with you!

One day more!

We will join these people's heroes (I did not live until today)

We will follow where they go (Watch them run amuck) (Tomorrow you'll be worlds away)

We will join these people's heroes
We will follow where they go
We will learn their little secrets
We will know the things they know

One day more!

Watch 'em run amuck (One more day all on my own)
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

We'll be ready for these schoolboys

Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in Heaven has in store!
One more dawn
One more day
One day 

I am ready Fantine!

Monsieur, lay down your burden

At the end of my days

You’ve raised my child in love

She’s the best of my life

And you will be with God

Papa, papa, I do not understand
Are you all right?
Why did you go away
You might also like
Cosette, my child
Am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God
I’ve lived to see this day

It’s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It’s you who must forgive a thankless man
It’s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try
On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping
I know it, Papa
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
(Oh, I'm ready, Fantine.)
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory
Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise
They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
We will walk behind the ploughshare;
We will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Tomorrow
