When your hope has been broken
And the fear is unspoken but true
You're never alone
Like a dream in a child
Or a childish dream in you
I'll do anything that I can do
To show you my love and comfort you
When you can't seem to find your way home
And when life gets too hard
To face on your own
I will stand as a light through your darkest unknown
I will walk with you
So you're never alone
You're never alone
Like a tear in the ocean
Or a star on a clear winter night
You're never alone
When the courage you needed
Has been all but defeated in you
I'll do anything that I can do
To show you my love and comfort you
You might also likeWhen you can't seem to find your way home
And when life gets too hard
To face on your own
I will stand as a light through your darkest unknown
I will walk with you
So you're never alone
Never Alone
Never Alone
Never Alone
When you can't seem to find your way home
And when life gets too hard
To face on your own
I will stand as a light through your darkest unknown
I will walk with you
I will walk with you
I will walk with you
So you're never alone
