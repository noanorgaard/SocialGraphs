God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues

Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said "Don't worry about a thing, baby doll, I'm the man you've been dreamin' of"
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
And she swear, "Goddamn, If I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls"
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door
They call her a killer and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore

God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
You might also like
Then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like

I've seen a rich man beg, I've seen a good man sin, I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin, I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up and everything in between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup and Smoked the finest green
I stroked the baddest of dimes at least a couple of times before I broke they heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start

I knew this kid named Max, who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He like to hang out late, he like to get shit-faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught up in the midst of all of this pain
You know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when they play the game

God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (What it's like)
