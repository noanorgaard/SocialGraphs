I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinnin' with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love

Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

To understand the miracle of livin'
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth

Lost in your eyes (Reason aside)

You and I

Something about you right here beside me
Touches the touched part of me like I can't believe
Pushing the night into the daytime
Watching the sky's first light
While the city sleeps
