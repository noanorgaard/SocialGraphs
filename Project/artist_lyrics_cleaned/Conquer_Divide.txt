Just take a look around, we're outta time
Watching it slip under our feet
If we don't keep it alive (If we don't keep it alive)
What's left inside?
Oh, if you still wanted
All the things that we believed in before
(We believed in before)
It's all or nothing (Seize the moment)
'Cause there's nothing left to lose
And we were meant for so much more
So get up and face your fears
Page after page, let's rewrite our history
They said we'd never beat the odds
So let's show them what we've got

It's not too late so keep your head up
We've been down this road before
I don't know what they think we're made of
We won't stop till we show them this is

War, did you forget about the dreams we wanted?
War, do you remember everything we started?
What do you stand for?
Don't take the path with the least scars
This is war
Today we get what we came for
You might also like
This isn't what I wanted to be
So I'll take it all with no regrets
Bring me back
And I'll pick you up when you fall to the ground
When you stumble you can take my hand
'Cause nothing's gonna bring us down, down, down
You've gotta crawl before you stand, before you stand

Oh, 'cause I can't stay here any longer
When my life's passing me by (Have we lost ourselves?)
With just one moment (One moment)
It could change our, our whole lives
We'll give up everything we have
For this last chance (Get on your feet, let's move)
The time is now to stand and fight
This is war; so choose your side

So here we stand against the odds
This is the calm, the calm before the storm
We won't stop until we show them this is

War, did you forget about the dreams we wanted?
War, do you remember everything we started?
What do you stand for?
Don't take the path with the least scars
This is war
Today we get what we came
