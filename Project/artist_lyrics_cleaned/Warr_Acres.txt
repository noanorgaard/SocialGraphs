And what will it be like when I see You
In all of Your glory and power?
Will I hear, "Well done, faithful servant
You treasured your hours"?
And oh may I be found in Your presence
Paying no mind to my needs
Consumed by Your infinite wonder
Content at Your feet?

I think I'll just linger
A little while longer
Oooh my flesh tries to flee
But my spirit pleads to stay
Ooh Your presence is peaceful
Your love's ever faithful
I'd ask for more years
But to You they appear just like a day
Ooh, so I think I'll just linger
You might also like
Ooh, whoa
Whoa, yeah

And what will it be like when I see You
In all of Your glory and power?
Will I hear, "Well done, faithful servant
You treasured your hours"?

My child, did you linger?
A little while longer
Those good works and deeds
Are not what I need
I only want you

And 'tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His word
Oh, just to rest upon His promise
And to know thus saith the Lord
And oh Jesus, Jesus
How I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Oh and Jesus, Jesus
Precious Jesus
Oh for grace to trust Him more
And oh Jesus, Jesus
How I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Oh and Jesus, Jesus
Precious Jesus
And oh for grace to trust Him more
Oh for grace to trust Him more
Oh for grace, to trust Him
