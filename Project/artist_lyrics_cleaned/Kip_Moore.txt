Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make you mine there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance

Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right

And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
