Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause

But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round

I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

But all I can think of is you

Well, the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there

Back in the summer of '69, ohh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no!
Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes, when I play that old six-string
Think about you, wonder what went wrong

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday
To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'Cause we can sing together in harmony
I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear
