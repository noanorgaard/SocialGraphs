Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on

Lost again, lost again
One day I know our paths will cross again
Smile again, smile again
One day I hope to make you smile again
I won't hide

Many times I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes

All the tears will clear
Then I feel no fear
Then I'd feel no way
My paths will remain straight

Home again, home again
One day I know I'll feel home again
Born again, born again
One day I know I'll feel strong again
I left my head

Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving 

I won't let you go, go on hungry
I won't let you cry, without a hand to dry

Rest your hands
Leave them tender
They weren't made for working, working at all

I won't let you go, go on hungry
I won't let you cry, without a hand to dry

Rest your soul, live in peace
I won't let you worry, worry at all
I won't let you worry, worry at all
I won't let you worry, worry at allYou might also
