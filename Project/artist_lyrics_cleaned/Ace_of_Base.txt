If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go, but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I won't let you know

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight (Holding me tight)
And if you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright (I'll be alright)

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know I'll survive, I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you, "Don't go"

As he walks away, he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life, they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
He's gone

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Baby, don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Just walk away (Just walk away)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
Don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Just walk away
Whoa, whoa, whoa, 

It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be here beside you
(And stay until the break of dawn)

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, woah-oh

It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh

(Ah) I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me?

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is enough, enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?

(Ah) Under the pale moon
For so many years, I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
