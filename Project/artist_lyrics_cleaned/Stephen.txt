The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now 'cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
Cause up here's hard to reach
Fly down, fly down

We were staring down the valley
When she put her arm around me
She said the reason you've been hurt is
So you look beyond the surface

The truth is
I'm freaking out about this whole
Man I'm supposed to be
I'm nervous now 'cause she can't know
I'm desperately in need
Cause up here's hard to reach
Fly down, fly down
Fly down

When he 'bout lost his mind

But don’t you worry now

It takes some breaking down, to see what's inside
To see what's inside

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
