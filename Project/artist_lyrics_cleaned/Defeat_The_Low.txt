Still Water (There are holes In the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes)
Still Water, Still Water (Except you gotta do it right)
Still Water, Still Water (You gotta have the hole already dug) Still Water, Still Water (Before you show up with the package in the trunk) Still water for me..

VERSE ONES
Still as water, calm but hard as Steele armor
Feel the aura, harbor thoughts of the harsh n' horrible
Still positive, cuz I'm real honest when spittin bars to you;
Talk the truth as I'm walkin thru darker routes
It's the honorable Marvo doin' the impossible
When droppin a tune, so remarkable
Every thought is FOOD, feed ya mind
Just by speakin rhymes, salute yall
Freedom fight demon-holy light a divine
All praises due to the most high
Gods gracious, a glorious cosign
The whole time-flowin' rhymes
Like crack w. a sober mind
Overtime clutch/never chokin on mic
Chosen one like Golden Child
Ya know my files
Foul enough to go to trial, came up on my own
So my Soul'll never be broken down
Queens finest forever honin' tha soun' 
You might also like
Still Waters where I'm floatin' now 
(New World Aura, New World)
