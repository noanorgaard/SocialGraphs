No! Please, I don't wanna go back!

Down, down thy soul is cast
From the Earth whenceforth ye fell
The path of fire leads thee to
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
Welcome back to
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
You are having
A Spooky Mormon Hell Dream now
You might also like
And now I've gone and done it again!

Rectus!

I've committed another awful sin!

Dominus!

I left my mission companion
All alone

Spookytus!

Oh God, how could I have done this to you?

Deus!

How could I break rule seventy-two?
Creepyus!

And now my soul hath just been thrown
Back into Spooky Mormon Hell Dream

Down, down to Satan's realm!
See where you belong!
There is nothing you can do!
No escape from
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!

You blamed your brother for eating the donut, and now you walk out on your mission companion? You're a dick!

Jesus, I'm sorry!

Jesus hates you, this we know!
For Jesus just told you so!

You remember Lucifer!
He is even spookier!

Minions of Hades
Have you heard the news?
Kevin was caught playing hooky!
Now he's back
With all you Cath'lics and Jews
It's super spooky-wooky!

I'm sorry, Lord, it was selfish of me
To break the rules, please
I don't wanna be in this
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!

Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Genghis Khan
Jeffrey Dahmer
Hitler
Johnnie Cochran!
The spirits all surround you
Spooky, spooky, spooky!
I started a war, and killed millions of Jews!

I slaughtered the Chinese!

I stabbed a guy and fucked his corpse!

I got O.J. freed!

You think that's bad?
I broke rule seventy-two!

Oh?

I left my companion!
I'm way worse than you!
I hate this Spooky Mormon Hell Dream

Spooky Mormon Hell Dream

Oh, Heavenly Father! P-please, give me one more chance! I won't break the rules again!

I can't believe Jesus called me a dick!

Welcome, welcome
To the Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
You are never waking up
From Spooky Mormon Hell Dream

Oh, please help me Father! Please let me wake up! (Down, down thy soul is cast)
Give me one more chance! I won't let you down again! (From the Earth henceforth ye fell)

This must be it, you must be there
You must be in
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
