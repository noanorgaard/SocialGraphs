It's alright, it's alright
Tell me you need me
Telling you that it's alright, it's alright
But you're no good for me

Pretty little thing
Attention only when in need
'Cause you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand on my own feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My attention is ending
You might also like
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Is certainly beside me
'Cause I've been searching for the answers
On this old abandoned road you've built
Desperate to see
Just don't get me started on the simple things (simple things)
Right before you fly, you fix the broken wings of
Every single promise that you flew my way
Picking up the notion that you may come back

It's alright, it's alright
Tell me you need me
Telling you that it's alright, it's alright
But you're no good for me

Pretty little thing
Attention only when in need
'Cause you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand on my own feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My attention is ending
What if I was worth more to you (more to you)
Than every broken breath we take
I hear your call you're crying out
I scream your name

Pretty little thing
Attention only when in need

Pretty little thing
Attention only when in need
'Cause you know that I'll cave in
Pretty little thing
You know the way to make me weak
But I'll stand on my own feet
Shame on you for hitting where it most hurts
Shame on me for listening
Pretty little thing
I think you better turn away
My attention is ending

My attention is ending
Oh, oh,
