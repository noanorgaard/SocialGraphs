It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control

I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left. 

And then a step to the right
You might also like
With your hands on your hips. 

You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy, free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded
I see all

With a bit of a mind flip

You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same

You're spaced out on sensation

Like you're under sedation

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Well, I was walking down the street just a having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pick-up truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left. 
And then a step to the right

With your hands on your hips. 

You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again


Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again


Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Hi, my name's Brad Majors. Do you have a phone I might use? Great Scott! Say, do one of you guys know how to Madison? For God's sake, keep a grip on yourself, Janet. 

Janet!

Dr. Scott!

Janet!

Brad!

Rocky!

I knew we was in with a bad crowd. 

Dammit! I knew I should've gotten that spare tire fixed. 

What diabolical plans I've seen thanks to this crazed imagination. 

Intruder is entering the building, master. 

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left. 

And then a step to the right

With your hands on your hips. 

You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

Master, put them in the fire. Embed

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Let's do the Time Warp again
