Gon' set it out pimpin', come on, nigga, keep it G
She got it from her momma, oh yes, she's a nasty freak
Plus she like 'em young like Boomerang's Lady Eloise
And ya girl swallows till her voice goes hoarse
She had all kinds of dick tangled up her spinal cord
The laws of physics couldn't explain how her legs behind her head
While she givin' head hangin' off the edge of the bed
Ya thought she had a milkshake the way her bang pop out her head
Pussy fat like Bone Crusher plus the ho ain't never scared
She licked all the dogs balls, scratched all the pussycats
So she goes both ways, yeah, she's a brainiac
