No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone (ooh)
Everybody bitchin', there's nothin' on the radio

Dreamin' again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes
(Chatterin' boys and a chicken at the choppin' block)
All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)

Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home (ooh)
Everybody bitchin', there's nothin' on the radio

Dreamin' again that it's freezin' and my mother's in her flowerbed
(Long dead rows of daffodil and marigold)
Changin' her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said
(Blood on my chin still chewin' on a red rose)

Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes 'round the yard

She says, "If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground"
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms

Have I found you? Flightless bird
Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth
Big pill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream

And when sister Lowery says amen, we won't hear anything
The ten-car train will take that word, that fledgling bird
And the fallen house across the way, it'll keep everything
The baby's breath, our bravery wasted and our shame

And we'll undress beside the ashes of the fire
Both our tender bellies wound in baling wire
All the more a pair of underwater pearls
Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern

In our days we will say what our ghosts will say
We gave the world what it saw fit and what'd we get?
Like stubborn boys with big green eyes, we'll see everything
In the timid shade of the autumn leaves and the buzzard's wing

And we'll undress beside the ashes of the fire
Our tender bellies all wound around in baling wire
All the more a pair of underwater pearls

Will you say to them when I'm gone
"I loved your son for his sturdy arms"?
We both learned to cradle then live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without

Will you say when I'm gone away
"Your father's body was judgement day"?
We both dove and rose to the riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside

Will you say to me when I'm gone
"Your face has faded but lingers on"?
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh

And I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe the joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave and I was goin' home
Oh, I flew through the sky and my convictions could not lie
For my country I would die and I will see it soon

And I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door, my wife, she laid upon the floor
And with tears, her eyes did soar, I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand and I saw the telegram
Said that I was a brave, brave man, but that I was dead
