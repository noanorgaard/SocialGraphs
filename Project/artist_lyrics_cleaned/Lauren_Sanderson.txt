I'm only nineteen, but if there's one thing I know
Happy's not a destination man, it comes and goes
This past week has been hell, man, I bet it shows
The good wouldn't be as great if we ain't had the lows (lows)
So low, I'm so fuckin' lost
Wandering around, drowning in these fucking thoughts
I'm super positive, I swear I give it all I got
But I never felt like that before, I never would've thought
It's okay to feel the downs, It's okay to be all confused and shit
It's okay to just sit back and breathe
Be and feel and think and ponder till you burst
Even when you feeling low, I hope you know you're not your worst

Oceans, we lost ourselves
In the oceans, we lost ourselves

Underneath the field of fake, this shit's reality
Step outside the box and step into abnormality
Every time I hear her voice, I feel a weapon stabbin' me
Every time I see her smile, I feel the time is passing me
You might also likeSwear I'm not depressed, it's just kinda late
I promise I'll be good in the morning when I wake
I promise I'll be good even if it's kinda fake
Cause faking is what makes it easier to find your way
So I wait, I know it will be get better
Even when it feels so never-ending, please remember
Accept what's in the past, you know that shit's whatever
Let's think about the future cause that shit is forever

Oceans, we lost ourselves
In the oceans, we lost ourselves
In the oceans, we lost ourselves
In the oceans, we lost

1 ContributorTime LyricsTo anyone who has ever tried to downplay my hard work, my independence, or my ability to kick ass on my own, this song is for you.Guess we bout four songs deep in this shit
Guess it's bout time I spill some new shit
Guess it's bout time I stop bein' so hard on myself
Guess it's also bout time I commit
Guess it's been one year since my first project dropped, yeah
& You know
Once you drop one, then it doesn't really ever stop, yeah
& It shows
They'll tell you you'll never do it alone
They'll tell you once you a hit, then you done
I'll show you all the success
In a lifetime we stressin' bout shit that don't matter
Cause I don't make time for that, no
I don't make time for that, no, no
Do this all on my own bitch
I'm bumpin' my own shit
Doin' the shit that you won't shit
I don't know shit about karma
Don't wanna mess with your problems
I heard you been messin' with drama
Better to say it than never say anything
Better to say it than not
Cause I'm not holdin' my breath
When you come at me reckless
I'm sayin' the shit that I want
You might also likeYou been talkin' all the talk, all the walk
No, I know you say the shit you do
We been seein' all the blogs and all the posts, oh
We know it's not you
I know you been seein' visions
Makin' moves off my decisions
They'll tell you you'll never do it alone
They'll tell you once you a hit, then you done
I'll show you all the success
In a lifetime we stressin' bout shit that don't matter
Cause I don't make time for that, no
I don't make time for that, no, no
Laid back, long flights, big heights, big time
Big grind, no time to blow
Big deals, big shine, two wheels, four lines
You know that I gotta hit the road
Everybody knowin' that I'm swingin' now
Yeah, I'm singin' out
Yes I'm a motherfuckin' singer now
New money, new problems
That's why it's pay me now or get cut off
That's why I told you to leave me alone
That's why I just been so distant at home
That's why the last time I said it's the last time
I promised my self no no no no no more
They'll tell you you'll never do it alone
They'll tell you once you a hit, then you done
I'll show you all the success
In a lifetime we stressin' bout shit that don't matter
Cause I don't make time for that, no
I don't make time for that, no, no
New life and there's new equations
New friends and new isolation
It's so funny how shit's correlated
I'm all, I'm all, I'm all on my own
Watch me while I blow up
Please don't call my phone
Don't you fuckin' show up
I'm all on my oh, oh, oh, own
I'm all on my oh, oh, oh, own
& I don't need you no more
They'll tell you you'll never do it alone
They'll tell you once you a hit, then you done
I'll show you all the success
In a lifetime we stressin' bout shit that don't matter
Cause I don't make time for that, no
I don't make time for that, no,
