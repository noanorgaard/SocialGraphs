Wine, she's spittin' out the wine
I forgot you left behind our favorite cherry red
Oh, love (Love, love, love)
I know this isn't love (Love, love, love)
'Cause I'm still thinkin' of you (Of love)
While she's gettin' undressed
I never shoulda left

She keeps remindin' me that you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
She keeps remindin' me how good it was
When we were crazy

In love (Love), love (Love)
She keeps remindin' me
How good it was (Was), was (Was)
She keeps remindin' me

Nights, I miss the faded nights
Stayin' out 'til mornin' light
Havin' breakfast in bed, woah
Now he (He's, he's, he's)
He's layin' in the sheets (Sheets, sheets, sheets)
The ones you bought for me (Me, me, me)
All tangled in a mess
It should be you instead

He keeps remindin' me that you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps remindin' me how good it was
When we were crazy

In love (Love), love (Love)
He keeps remindin' me
How good it was (Was), was (Was)
He keeps remindin' me

I'm tryna forget you with all my regrets
But I'm still hangin' onto the memories that you left
I deleted your number with every text
Still tryna forget you, forget you
She keeps remindin' me that you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps remindin' me how good it was
When we were crazy (Yeah-yeah)
She keeps remindin' me (Oh, he keeps remindin' me)
That you're still gone and I'm still lonely (Oh-oh)
He keeps remindin' me how good it was
When we were crazy (When we were lovin' crazy, babe)

In love (Love), love (Love)
He keeps remindin' me how good it was (Was), was (Was)
She keeps remindin' me (He keeps remindin' me, yeah)

Wine, she’s spittin' out the wine
I forgot you left 

Can't stop this bleeding
Can't stop you leaving
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

You showed me heaven
You rang a bell
I played with matches
It hurt like hell
Asleep, awake
You're all I see
I can't escape you, can't set you free
I miss your full moon rising
Catching a breath in silence

(Missing you, missing you)
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
(Missing you, missing you)
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby I'm comin, baby I'm comin
Tell me now baby I'll come running
Baby I'm comin, baby I'm comin
Say the word baby I'll come running

Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Oh, I'm missing the sound, I'm missing the sound of your beating, beating
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Oh and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Beating, beating
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart
