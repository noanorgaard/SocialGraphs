His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones

I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones

I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go a little long on your own for a bit

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Radiate, -iate, -iate your light on
Radiate, -iate, -iate, -iate a lifetime

Ooh, you let 'em go

Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight

Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81

Oh-oh, oh-oh

Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet

'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel

I can't go back to how I felt before
There's–

That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81


Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car, all black with diplomatic 

If I'm born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who's gonna say a little grace for me?

We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
