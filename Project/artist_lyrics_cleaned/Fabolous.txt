Stash in the dash
Hold two heaters
Blockahhhhh put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs
Ballin', Brooklyn don
Addicted to Cris' hooked on Dom
15 G's hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin', guys that send Po's
'Cause I chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me, I tried to hint hoes
Look at the hurt your eyes will squint closed
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Listen to the two way alert
It goes...
Let's go VIP boo raise your skirt

Show me how to move, that's why I never trip

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe, I'm speakin' general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On Fifth Ave. shoppin' sprees, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

Just off the shore, so you can hear when the water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks you be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was Crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits

Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becomin' too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted

Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, "Did we miss a Mercedes sale?"
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son, I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it 'cause I got it, I got it, so you get it
In Miami they say, "Don't stop, get it, get it"
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

You ain't gotta worry bout her, shorty straight
Been chasing her for 2 days, first 48
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand em the tone

So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
