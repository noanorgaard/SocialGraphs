Welcome to the land of fame excess, am I gonna fit in?

I jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time

Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy

Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turning, and I'm feeling kinda homesick
Too much pressure, and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And the Jay-Z song was on

And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up, they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like yeah
Moving my hips like yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA

Put up your dukes

Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (Alright)
Let's talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let's talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you (Ooh)

You're all in the world to me (Pa-pa)
It feels like the first time (Ah)
It feels like the very first time (Ah)
It feels like the first time

It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, straight up (Oh)
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord (Oh)
Baby got them open all over town (Oh)
Strictly biz, she don't play around (Oh)
Cover much ground got game by the pound (Oh)
Getting paid is her forte (Mmm)
Each and every day, true player way (Mmm)
I can't get her outta my mind (Oh, wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Oh)
I like the way you work it (Uh-huh)
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby (Oh, oh, no)
I like the way you work it (Uh-huh)

Everybody look to the left
Everybody look to the right

Givin' me everything inside and out

It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us

You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
(I) How could a person like me care for you (Ah)
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Is enough enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you all alone
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign (I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
I saw the sign (I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
I saw the sign

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreamin'
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
Then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
Is this burning an eternal flame
