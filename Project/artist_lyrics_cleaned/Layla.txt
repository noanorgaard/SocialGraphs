Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love take me high
Higher love, higher love
Higher love with you
Oh my love, open up
Oh my love you give me truth
Honest love, honest love
All this love for you

Here is your heart coming 'round the bend
Oh my heart, oh my heart
And here is your love, it's coming 'round again
Coming 'round, coming 'round
Here in the haze, beg the moon to stay
Dreaming on, dreaming on
As we hold the night, the sun explodes the day
Light explodes, light explodes
You might also like
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love take me high
Higher love, higher love
Higher love with you
Oh my love, open up
Oh my love, you give me truth
Honest love, honest love
All this love for you
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, take me high
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love take me high
Higher love, higher love
Higher love with you
Oh my love, open up
Oh my love, you give me truth
Honest love, honest love
All this love for
