1 ContributorCan’t Relive the Party LyricsYou may not know me
But I know you
And I’m aware how strange that sounds
Y’see, we cross paths
Every Thursday at 2
Goin’ to class to make ya mama proud
I ain’t the type’a guy
You’d usually hang around
Baby, I got potential
It’s in due time
So let’s not waste now
Come and skip class with me
I’ll take ya to the wrong side of the street
Take ya down to the places your mama calls “hood”
The same places I call home and spent childhood
Where time seems to slow down- slow down
Until you can feel the earth beneath you goin’ round and round
I can see the crazy in your eyes growin’ brighter
With every word that flies from my mouth
And I know, this may sound irrational, but
You can’t go wrong livin’ by the motto

You can always retake the class
But you can’t relive the party
You can always retake the class
But you can’t relive the party
You might also likeI seen them other guys that you keep tame
And in steady control like your hair and your GPA
It’s a shame you were never the one
To ride your bike no-hands in the summer just coastin’
Tell me the last time you smiled just because
Somethin’ happened without you havin’ planned it
Yeah- Girl, it’s time to let go and let the handle bars do the dancin’

Look hurr little bookworm
We doin’ this or not? Click “deny” or “confirm”
I know ya think I’m just kickin’ hype prose
Like the rest’a them Ghastons and Federline Jones’
But I ain’t got all the time in the free world
To be hollerin’ at just any library girl
Struck me like a Scott Hall dropkick
NWO- the new young hotness
I only make moves on a whim
Let’s take this road trip to the middle of Wisconsin-
California- even New Orleans
Party ‘til dawn, wake up and watch adult swim
Oh, you were headed to the bookstore?
‘Bout to drop a couple hundred on text books?
Ma, we could flip that money two-fold
Throw a house party, charge 5 for the keg cups
You rep honor roll, I rep Delta Chi
You say “dope fresh”, I say “hella fly”
Baby, we’re isotopes, different nuclei
On the same table, forever livin’ by
