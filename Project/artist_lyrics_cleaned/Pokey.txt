Now Willie he'd jump, he'd jump and say
It don't bother me, let's make it all day
Willie he'd jump, he'd jump up right
It don't bother me, let's make it all night
Daylight come and nighttime go
It's a silly little thing, but you can't get around it, no
Just like Willie, I got to go
(?) knockin' at my door
The door swing in, the door swing out
Got to know which way I'm goin'
Goin' down to Little Rock, there ain't no doubt
That's the tune I'm blowin'
Now who's this Willie guy anyway?
Doesn't really matter, now, he didn't really say
Well he jump, he jump and shout
Don't bother me, let's bring it on out
Bring it on out, pour it out the spout
But don't spill any on Willie
Silly little thing, but you can't get around it, no
Whoa, just like Willie, I got to go
The rhythm of the night is
You might also likeKnockin', knockin', knockin', knockin', knockin' at my door
Don't believe I think I even heard it
He's rockin', rockin', rockin' on the floor
Kickin' up rugs where the dirt is
He's kickin' up the rugs and climbin' up the walls
He's slippin' out the windows and slidin' down the halls
Old man bat just battin' at the balls
Keep it on the run like you heard it
And Willie said "let's keep it on the run"
If it ain't on the run, it ain't much fun"
Willie said, "don't bother me
If I can make it 'til six, I can make it 'til three"
Turn that six into three, really really hittin' his stride
It's cold out there, take the whole damn thing inside
If it's not Willie, I pay no mind
I got to find out what's in the night
Find that thing I'm lookin' for
Don't believe I think I'm even lookin'
Got to let out through the door
Get myself a cookin'
Now Willie say "When you cook it like that
Don't use no fat, just cook it like that"
Keep you quick-step lean and mean
If you're walkin' onto, that's all you need
That's all you need to keep from landin' yourself in the pokey
Your a silly little thing, but you can't get around, oh no
Just like Willey, I got to go
Got to find what's in the night
Got to find what's in the night
Where all them lights are glowin'
Got to chew all I can bite
Willie say "don't be holdin'
'Cause all you need to be landin' in the po
Gotta watch you tell that funky Jo
Bop your head and let it sew
You can check it out in the mornin'

Now Willie jumped, he jumped and say
"Don't bother me, let's make it all day"
Willie he jumped, he jumped all right
"Don't bother me, let's make it all night"
