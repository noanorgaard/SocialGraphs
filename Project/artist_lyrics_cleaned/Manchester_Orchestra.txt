How proud now?

I give it to the ocean
The ocean

I hope you don't choke
On that last passive word that you keep in your throat
It's so cool to be you
We're all walking around like a kid out of school

Pray, wait, pray

"You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down"
Forty miles out of East Illinois
For my old man's heart attack

And I believed you were crazy
You believe that you love me

Every stone I've thrown has gone away
It's gone away, it's gone away
Every stone I've thrown has gone away
It's gone away, it's gone away
