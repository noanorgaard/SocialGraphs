When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me
Can't you see?

I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it movin'
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please, can you make this work for me?
'Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings

Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah, we got nothing to lose

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you

This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far

I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?

No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again

I'd never ask you 'cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say, "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant, I'm so dependent, I'm such a fool
When you're not there, I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear, can't face the truth

Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete

So keep your head up, and make it to me

So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong

The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
