Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time


You say, "Go slow," I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time

Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, (I will be waiting) I will be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after


And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one

But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the workin' day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls, they want, wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

And hide her away from the rest of the world
