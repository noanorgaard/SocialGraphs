Well, we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver!"
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Well, see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well, take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved (Get dissolved)
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go

If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me

Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?

Well, all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Well, you told me about nowhere, well, it sounds like someplace I'd like to go
Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield, it was broken, but I love the fresh air, you know
(The dashboard melted but we still had the radio, oh)

Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio, oh)
Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted to know
Oh-oh-oh-oh, now here we go!

Oh! It would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good, oh)

Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good, oh)
Oh, if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a co--
Oh-oh-oh-old, now here we go!

Well, we schemed and we schemed, but would always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon
Every dawn one yells, "Surprise," and in the evening one's consoling, sayin'
"See it wasn't quite as bad as—"

Well, it  would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show

Yeah, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we had to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted, but we still have the radio, oh)

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I hope so

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get

When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye

When the Earth folded in on itself (You missed)
And said "Good luck, for your sake I hope Heaven and Hell
(You missed, you missed)
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well, I don't mind, I don't mind
How the hell could I mind?

Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
The room lit up and we ran about
Well, this is what I'd really call a party now
Packed up our cars, moved to the next town
Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
This is what I'd really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
This one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
Shaved off my eyebrows, let 'em fall to the ground
So I can't look surprised right now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Burn it up or just chop it down
This one's done so where to now?

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)

Well, you all know what I'm talking about
The room lights up, well, we're still dancing around
We're having fun, having some fun now
Pack up again, head to the next place

Open one up and let it fall to the ground
Pile out the door when it all runs out

We're all going, we're all going

We have spines and other bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw stones
Oh, this is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Well, we're the human race
We're going to party out this place
And then move on
(Tough luck)
We'll kill you off and then make a clone
Yeah, we got spines and we have bones!
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Our soft feelings are getting hurt
Oh, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside these jeans
Well, we want just our water clean
This is how it's always been
And this is how it's going to be
So, you just move on
(Yow!)
The air's on fire so we're moving on
Better find another one 'cause this one's done
Waiting for the magic of the scientist's glove
To push, push, push, push, pull us up
Spend some time to floating out in space
Find another planet, make the same mistakes
Our minds all shatter when we climb on board
Hoping for the scientists to find another door

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand

Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
