Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!

We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk

From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation

Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

With Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin' and sockin' and rockin' and puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of HIP-HOP!!

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh

Come on

Come on

There was a time when our music
Was something called "The Bay Street" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor
