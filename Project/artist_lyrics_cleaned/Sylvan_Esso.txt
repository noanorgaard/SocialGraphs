Sing that song like I know you can
Work your jaw like a blind man
Call that call like you own the land
Throw up your hands
Make demands

Do the silent shifter
You look good in the north
Whip your hair back and forth
You look good in the east

Move your feet
You look good in the south
Make your makers proud
You look good in the west
You look good in a dress
