Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous  night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms, you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
Then I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Sing a happy song and we'll sing along, mm-mm

We shall walk again all along down the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to
With our heads so high, smile at passers by
Then we'll softly sigh, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Well you watch the train go 'round the bend
Play in dust and dream that it will never end
Deep in your heart

By my side, come on, come on run
All right, hey, in the country

And you, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da? (Lyin' on the green grass)

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

And the rain let up, and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck
Nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me


On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes
Well, he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said "Hey! There you are"
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me
Well, it stoned me to my soul
Stoned on me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
Well, it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned
