I don’t know where I’m going but I can’t keep staying inside
I don’t know if I’m living or forgetting I’m waiting to die
and I still coming up with nothing like it’s all just stuck in my mind
I don’t know where I'm running but I hope I don’t run out of time

My fear of failure
wakes me up in the night so that I can’t sleep
I promise later
I won’t make any promises I can’t keep

But I don’t know where I’m going but I can’t keep staying inside
I don’t know if I’m living or forgetting I’m waiting to die
and I still coming up with nothing like it’s all just stuck in my mind
I don’t know where I'm running but I hope I don’t run out of time
I don’t know where I’m going but I can’t keep staying inside
I don’t know if I’m living or forgetting I’m waiting to die
and I still coming up with nothing like it’s all just stuck in my mind
I don’t know where I'm running but I hope I don’t run out of
