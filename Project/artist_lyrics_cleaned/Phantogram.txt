How many times will I burn it down

What would I do if it didn't affect you?
Merry-go-round and 'round and 'round, oh
Tell me the truth, I know that you're leaving
Tell me the truth, I know it's you

Could it be that I fell apart? It shows
The lines on the face ate away my smile
Could it be that I fell apart?

You've got a mouthful of diamonds
And a pocketful of secrets
I know you're never telling anyone
Because the patterns, they control your mind
Those patterns take away my time
