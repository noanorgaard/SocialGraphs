She'll be alone when I leave her
I like it better that way
I'm on my own when I need her
'Cause they could dead her that way
She's addicted to the heroin
Lighter than a feather that day (Day)
But I kind of like the morphine (Morphine)
Triple X double bottle, lean, codeine
What you want?
I'm that motherfucker
Baby, I'm that motherfucker
What you on?
Nothing like them other suckers
Nothing like them other suckers, yeah
Mrs. Lucille
Come and touch me
Let me know that you're real
Because if you're fake (If you're fake)
I got to get away
Punch you in the fucking face
See Ricky Hil LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like
Should have known from the start
What we got can't leave this room
And I ain't playing with your heart
It's just a habit to let bitches know the truth
I made it clear to the world
Ain't nobody gonna be that somebody
I made it clear to the world
Ain't nobody gonna be that somebody

I do it all to stay warm
I do it all to get by
I do it all for a home
For a night
But, baby
I won't keep ya
Just know that
I'mma leave ya
So, fuck me right
Baby, fuck me right
Until I'm too tired to leave ya
And we can
Call this your night
Wipe those tears from your eyes
'Cause, baby it's alright, woah
Baby it's alright
I got a bottle of the 'Tron
In my brand new coat
If you want to take a sip
To forget what we did
Girl, I've done this before
I get faded all alone
'Til my body gets thin
To forget all my sins

Should have known from the start
What we got can't leave this room
And I ain't playing with your heart
It's just a habit to let bitches know the truth
I made it clear to the world
Ain't nobody gonna be that somebody
I made it clear to the world
Ain't nobody gonna be that somebody

Oh, oh
Nomads, XO!
