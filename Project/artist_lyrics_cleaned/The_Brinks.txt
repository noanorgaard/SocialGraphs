So unsafe
Is this temporary love I crave
Will we ever get enough to take
From the memory, it was a phase
Is this temporary love?
Oh is this temporary love?

Wash your cuts, let the salt dry
Shed your skin on a whim and be all mine
Is our love just a part time?
Sometimes I think that it's more, have I lost sight?

So unsafe
Is this temporary love I crave
Will we ever get enough to take
From the memory, it was a phase
Is this temporary love?
Oh is this temporary love?

On and on, my friends
We will sing until it ends
On and on, my friends
We will sing until it ends
On and on, my friends
We will sing until it ends
'Til it ends

So unsafe
Is this temporary love I crave
Will we ever get enough to take
From the memory, it was a phase
Is this temporary love?
Oh is this temporary
