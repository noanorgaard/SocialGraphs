Are we running out of time, are we
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special
I think so

'Cause when you're conquering my day and night
Easing the pain inside
Got me laughing all of the time
Keep the bad things out of my mind, out of my mind

Eyes caressing my skin
Undressing my every flaw
Ooh will we sink, or swim
We're blinded on an empty shore

Are we going round in circles
Are we running out of time, are we
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers' place
I was stucked in a puddle full of tears and unwise dark doings
Now, I know that we've paid unlike
Honey, I know, hey, when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too, it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window that's what those lovers do

And I'm missing my miss of roses
Holding my head high up and
My head high up and
I know that she is stronger
'Cause she can break the silence, break the silence
So meet me by sea, you see it's ours
And our place to be somewhere else

Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away

Now we should run away
I can now hear them tapping on the ground
Where do we wanna go?
I know an ambush where we won't be found

So we went to the place, honey
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there is no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon
And all the shining lights in the night

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?

I hope that you don't run away

Caused by absence of you

I know that you must feel like facing
With ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
