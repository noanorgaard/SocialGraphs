Move like we sippin' lean
I'm a fiend for booty in some tight jean
'seen her over t-shirt
Move it like a private dancer
Slow motion for me
Do it like a fan and 
Making a freaking nigga lie in a bedsheet
Want it so bad
I can hear the bed squeak
I'ma take you home
'cause you're so super
After we split this molly
I'm calling the Uber
Two empty bottles
Your ass on a console
My tongue in your pussy
I sing a vibrato
The moment I met you
Could tell that you're special
Now kick off them J's
Like you're my Cinderella
Girl how I want cha there's no-body bet-ta
Girl how I want cha there's no-body bet-ta
Girl how I want cha there's no-body bet-ta
There's nobody bet-ta
There's nobody bet-ta
Your love got me so trippy, trippy, trippy
Your love got me so trippy, trippy, trippy
Your love got me so trippy, trippy, trippy
Your love got me so trippy, trippy
I heard you like it slow...
