I just wanna have some fun
You know I wanna have some too!
Ay, I said, can I just have some fun?
We about to turn the mansion out
And we can do it with the cameras out
Sexy, can 

Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—

As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin (Startin' here, right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you (Promise love), trust me, I'll trust you (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (Yes, we would)
Makin' love all day (It would feel so good), have us a baby (Woo)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Oh, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended up on this road
And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin (Introducin' yourself all over again)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (Would you be my girlfriend?)
Promise to love you (Yes, I promise to love you), trust me, I'll trust you (Trust me, baby, and I'll trust you)
If I had one wish (One wish), we would run away (One wish)
Makin' love all day (One wish), have us a baby (Have us a baby)
If I had one wish (Ooh), I'd make you my whole life (Yes, I will)
And you'll be my wife (Yes, I will), make it right this time
If I had one wish, we would be best friends (Some people wish to be a superstar, wish to have a fancy car)
Love would never end, it would just begin (Wish to have a million bucks, I'm wishin' on bein' in love)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo (So feel me, pretty baby)
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you (I'd make one wish and I'd wish it all on you)
If I had one wish (Oh), we would run away (Oh)
Makin' love all day, have us a baby (Makin' love 'til the break of dawn, me and you 'til the baby's born)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Yeah, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one
