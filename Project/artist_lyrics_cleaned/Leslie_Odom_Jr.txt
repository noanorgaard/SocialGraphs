Oh, Philip, when you smile, I am undone
My son, look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now
Oh, Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

I swear that
I'll be around for you (I'll be around for you)

I'll do whatever it takes

I'll make a million mistakes

I'll make the world safe and sound for you
Will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

Five six seven eight nine—

There are ten things you need to know

Number one!

We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

Number two!

Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

Number three!
See Leslie Odom Jr. LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

Five!

Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

Near the same spot (Near the same spot)
Your son died, is that (My son died, is that)
Why—(Why—)
Six!

He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

Seven!

Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

Number eight!

Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter
Number nine!

Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?
Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye
Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza
My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

He aims his pistol at the sky—

Wait!
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

I hear wailing in the streets

Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”

Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

Angelica and Eliza—
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it
I survived, but I paid for it
Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I should’ve known
I should’ve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and 

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
(Preacher, preacher, preacher)
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya

Climb, climb, climb
He has somethin' to prove, he has nothin' to lose
Lose, lose, lose, lose
Hamilton's pace is relentless, he wastes no time
Time, time, time
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
Changes the game
Plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason he seems to thrive
When so few survive, then goddamnit

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name, what's your name, man?"

My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait

When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

And Alex got better, but his mother went quick

Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice sayin', "Alex, you gotta fend for yourself"
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (Ooh)

And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany

I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

There as a New York junior delegate
Now what I'm gonna say may sound indelicate

Talks for six hours, the convention is listless

Aaron Burr, sir

Well, it's the middle of the night

Can we confer, sir?

Is this a legal matter?

Yes, and it's important to me

What do you need?

Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

Okay?

I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court
You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense, you're the solution

Who's your client?

The new U.S. Constitution?

No

Hear me out

No way

A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

No one will read it

I disagree
And if it fails?

Burr, that's why we need it
The constitution's a mess

So it needs amendments
It's full of contradictions

So is independence
We have to start somewhere

No, no way

You're making a mistake

Good night

Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

What?

We won the war, what was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

Of course

Then defend it

And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

I'll keep all my plans close to my chest
Wait for it, wait for it, wait
I'll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
I'm taking my time watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow
I am sailing off to London
I'm accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

Angelica

Don't forget to write

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers
The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men
In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays in the span of six months
John Jay got sick after writing five
James Madison wrote twenty-nine
Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one

How do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?

Every day you fight like you're running out of time
Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time?

How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write every second you're alive?

To get the people that I need

I'm sorry Burr, I've gotta go

But—

Decisions are happening over dinner

Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

Diametric'ly opposed, foes

They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were
Previously closed

Bros

The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation's capital
And here's the pièce de résistance:

No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
The room where it happened

Thomas claims—

Alexander was on Washington's doorstep one day
In distress 'n disarray
Thomas claims—

Alexander said—

I've nowhere else to turn!

And basic'ly begged me to join the fray
Thomas claims—

I approached Madison and said—
"I know you hate 'im, but let's hear what he has to say."

Thomas claims—

Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

But!
No one else was in—

The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one else was in—

We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in (The room where it happens)
The room where it happens

Meanwhile—

Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev'ry issue can be settled by committee

Meanwhile—

Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—
Company screams in chaos

It isn't pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—

Oh-ho!

A quid pro quo

I suppose

Wouldn't you like to work a little closer to home?

Actually, I would

Well, I propose the Potomac

And you'll provide him his votes?

Well, we'll see how it goes

Where you put the U.S. Capital?
Cuz we'll have the banks

You got more than you gave

And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don't get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…
