Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around


We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't
