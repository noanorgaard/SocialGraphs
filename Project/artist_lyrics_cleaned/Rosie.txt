But after all
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My angel baby

When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My angel baby

Whoo-who, I love you
Whoo, I do
No one could love you
Like I do
You might also likeWooo whooo whoo whoo whoo
Woo whooo Whoo

Please never leave me
Blue and alone
If you ever go
I'm sure you'll come back home

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My angel baby

It's just like heaven
Being with you, dear
I could never stay
Away without you near

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My angel baby
Wooohoo, I love you
Whooohoo, I do
No one could love you
Like I do
Woooo whooo whooo
Woooooo whoo
