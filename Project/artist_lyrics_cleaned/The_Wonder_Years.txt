If you want me to go, then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave, I can leave
I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening?

I can't get my footing steadied in all of this
I'm always ducking swings or looking over my shoulder
When I should be making progress
This is the shit that they don't teach you how to deal with
Like an army of self-righteous kids that only like the 7 inch
I'm putting miles between myself and this bullshit

If you want me to go, then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave, I can leave
I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening?
If you want me to go, then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave, I can leave
I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
'Cause I'm listening

I guess this is what it's like
The life of a pigeon 
(I know we're hard-pressed to find some common ground)
(But I won't let this world wipe me out)

Well, if you want me to go, then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave, I can leave
But I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening?
If you want me to go, then I'll go
And if you ask me to leave, I can leave
I won't be afraid of making mistakes if you're listening
Are you listening?
Are you
