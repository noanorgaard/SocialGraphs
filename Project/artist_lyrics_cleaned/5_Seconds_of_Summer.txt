I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
As I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

When we both fall asleep underneath the same sky
To the beat of our hearts at the same time
So close, but so far away
Can you hear me?

I'm tryna find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was beside you

Another day
Of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
Fade away
Lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track

To bring an end to promises
That I make in times of desperate conversation
Hoping my night could be better than this in the end
Just say when

Don't make this easy
I want you to mean it, Jasey
Say you'll mean it
You're dressed to kill
I'm calling you out
Don't waste your time on me

I've never told a lie and that makes me a liar
I've never made a bet, but we gamble in desire
I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire
But recently the flames are getting out of control
Call me a name, kill me with words
Forget about me, it's what I deserve
I was your chance to get out of this life
But I ditched the car and left you to drown
Wait outside, I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath (I want you to mean and chase me)
And my words are as timed as the beating in my chest (Say you'll mean it)
You're dressed to kill, I'm calling you out
Don't waste your time on 

Every time you say to me it's over
You just wanna start again, it's just lies
The girl who cries wolf every day
Ignored by gravity, but in the end, don't ask why

You say you wanna
But do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh, yeah
Where you goin'? Always runnin'
Find a way to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreamin'
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leavin'

'Cause I'm not leavin'
Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh-oh

Does it have to be this tragedy?
This endless lost parade
A castle of façade and make-believe?
The truth is spelled out in your eyes
Why don't you just reach out and make it clear to me?
What are you telling me?

You say you wanna
But do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh, yeah
Where you goin'? Always runnin'
Find a way to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreamin'

Eh-eh-oh, eh-eh-oh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, 

That everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

Don't stop doing what you're doin'
Every time you move to the beat, it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it

You're coming close now, swear I can taste it
You got me tongue tied, I can't escape it
I'm loving what you got
But then you push me off, oh oh-oh-oh

And everybody wants to take you home tonight (Ah-ah)
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine (Ah-ah)

Don't stop doing what you're doin'
Well, every time you move to the beat, it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don't stop 'cause you know that I like it
And every time you walk in the room, you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it

Every day, it's the same
All the games that you play (Ooh-ooh)
Back and forth, 'round and 'round
Kinda like it this way

Don't stop doin' what you're doin'
Every time you move to the beat, it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it

Don't stop doing what you're doin' (Ah, ah)
Every time you move to the beat, it gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don't stop (Ah)

'Cause you know that I like it (Ah)
('Cause you know that, you know that I like it)
Every time you walk in the room, you got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it


'Cause I know what'll happen
If we get through this

And if the earth ends up crumblin' down to its knees, then, baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
(Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out)
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around, then, baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

When I feel so damn lost
And it comes with a cost of being alone
Everything is falling down, we're suffering
Helpless thoughts and out we sing, prayers go to the sky

And if the earth ends up crumblin' down to its knees, then, baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
(Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out)
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around, then, baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
