Your mama's flying high as a kite
You're just like the next one
'Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming

Everyone's faking like they can
It makes it alright
Tell me what you want to
'Cause I don't know the wrong from the right

Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head
Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head
Your Trojan's in my head

It's okay if it's gone
The thoughts that you had that it was the one
And, oh, what is left?

Take a look, hesitate
Take a picture you could never recreate
Write a song, make a note
For the lump that sits inside your throat
Change the locks, change the scene
