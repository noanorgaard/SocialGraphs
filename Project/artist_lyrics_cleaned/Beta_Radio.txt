And if you're gonna go, then go big
Oh, but you might lose
And if you lose, then lose big
And hang out where the losers do

I rode with my friend from upstate
In his truck from coast to coast
We slept in the back in the desert
And on the side of the road the most

And, oh, when we went, oh, we went big
And all that we did lose
Won't compare to everything we got
When we hung out where the losers do

You might also like
Do you remember when I wrote good morning
To you in the snow?
When I did not use my fingers
Neither did I use my toes

And you just said that the glory of the land
Was inside of you
And then you came and you held onto my clean hand
And we walked where the losers do
Embed

And I saw it in the skies
In the direction of the lonely eyes
And I wanted it to be
A place that's meant for me

Rose of Sharon
Come near I'll spit it out
It's the muzzle for the mouth
What do you say?
I'm going my own way
Oh it is such a curse
When running in reverse
You might also like
And I saw it in the skies
In the direction of the lonely eyes
And I wanted it to be
A place that's meant for me
Oh my, my, my, my
And I wanted not to fight
With my heart but I'll fight with my fists all night
And I'm sure now the record shows
Or maybe just the bruise underneath my clothes

Ba, da, da, da
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
And I know it, and I know it
Oh I know it now
Oh it's showing
Ba, da, da, da
Oh it's showing
Ba, da, da, da
Oh it's showing
Ba, da, da, da
Oh it's showing
Oh it's showing
Oh it's showing now
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
And I know it
Ba, da, da, da
Oh I know it
Oh I know it, how I know it
