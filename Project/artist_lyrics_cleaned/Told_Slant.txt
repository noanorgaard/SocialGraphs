I don't wanna make my bed for anyone
I don't wanna spread my legs for anyone
I like to make my breakfast alone
Walk myself to the store and then back to the porch

And I liked your short black mullet
It wasn't love, but I don't know what to call it


Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

And reread all the ones you sent to make sure that you meant them
You can kiss me just to miss me later
You can kiss me just so you feel betterYou might also
