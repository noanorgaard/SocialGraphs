Who do you think that you are?
When I tell y'all that I run things
Y'all better believe me
Spin the earth on my finger like round ball
I'm a globetrotter, its easy
No lie boy y'all got me messed up
Not Buddha, Muhammad and I dang sure ain’t no Yeezus (at all)
Y'all all like I ain't made where you standing
Y'all act like I ain't drown the whole planet
Act like my son ain't died on that cross
Or I ain't gave you my all look here I ain't taking no loss
I love you with all of my heart that's the reason I'm here with my hands open giving my grace
I know that you know that I'm here ignore me if you want but the next time you spit in my face
You better just

Look up in the sky, ooh I made it
Think I'm gonna lie? Well I tell you I ain't gon' take it
I got hands on the nations, check my reputation
Yeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant
That's why I'm
Undefeated
Ah ah ah ah
Undefeated
Turn up
Undefeated

Undisputed no mistakes or plan B
In the end you’ll all marvel like it's Stan Lee
Don't doubt me but know about me
It don't look like I'm in the lead
But your ignorance don't make you safe
Because the worst punch (is) the one you don't see
Till you don't see that I ain't done yet
Watch all the glory my Son gets
The whole world's been set up
But you backwards, you upset
I was the one that put man on this planet
But I'm manning the planets
And planet by planet I'm planning out history
Spoiler alert I get the victory over your habitat
Matter fact matters a matter act to my exact
If you like it then you should put a ring on it, I told Saturn that
Look up in the sky, ooh I made it
Think I'm gonna lie? Well I tell you I ain't gon' take it
I got hands on the nations, check my reputation
Yeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant
That's why I'm
Undefeated
Ah ah ah ah
Undefeated
Turn up
Undefeated

(Never lost no)
No death (never lost no)
No natural disaster (Never lost boy no never ever lost boy)
No new philosophy
Nothing in the past (My people never lose boy never ever lose boy)
No demon
No disease (Never ever lose boy because I never lose boy never ever lose boy)
Always and forever I'm undefeated
Handle it, can you handle it?
I managed the world's  mismanagements
Thousands of years of the worst things (the earth’s curse)
And it hurts me but I got purposes in the hurts of men
If you don’t know it now, you’ll know it then
There’s a greater good, don’t worry friend
Where my glory goes, it reverses it
Amen


Give me that, church mother and they church hat, clap
Man, that Shug Avery Color Purple coming back, clap, uh
When that whole week beat you up and stress ya
But you hear that organ playing it remind ya of ya blessings
And on another note, she just hit another note
Chills down my spine got me crying, make me over Lord
You don't know about us though, old school church hymns
Deacons get to humming now, the drummer finna burst in
(Lordy, Lordy, Lord) Can you hear me now?
Church clothes sweaty, you don't care, you just get it now (C'mon)
Testify, how we made martyrs outta these fathers (Yes!)
And rose up all of his daughters to glorify Him with honor
Man, I swear I saw Miss Jones with her hair did
Now it's flying everywhere, she don't care what her hair did
She an heir, yeah, caught up in the air, yeah
Probably why she clapping like Jesus just reappeared, yeah

Oh, Lord!
Give me that God almighty
That good old Gospel
That old school doctrine
Oh, Lord!
Give me that truth for the body
Ain't nothing new about it
But it's still full of power
Th-th-th-that church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap

I wanna be the type of dude that get the Lord on His feet
I wanna do the type of shows that the Lord wanna see
What I mean (What you mean?), if I could make the whole church clap
But ain't a clap in the heavens then that clap just a clap, clap
For the Son glorified, sin mortified
The Holy Spirit's going where that truth ain't watered down
It's sound doctrine, get Spurgeon and Calvin out
Nothing wrong with singing loud, but that ain't where the power's found
For too long the churched church has been clappin' at weak sermons
Leaving the weak hurt, no one's changed by Sunday service
We need discernment, check what you be affirming
'Cause the church can be full of members (Follow) but empty in conversion
Preach the gospel (Gospel), and stand back
Look for changed lives, not for handclaps
Love people well, oh, they can't stand that
The church is the church when the Word's where we stand at
Oh, Lord!
Give me that God Almighty
That old school Gospel
That old school doctrine
Oh, Lord!
Give me that truth for the body
Ain't nothing new about it
But it's still full of power
Th-th-th-that church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church clap
(Oh, Lord!) Church clap, let me hear the church clap, church 

Uh, let me get that
Y'all boys gone sit back
If the mic is open I'mma grip that
Here's a clip from the clique
Then it's click clack then blast like (pow)
Might have been some foes (pow)
But it still ain't cold
But it's hotter than Peter Piper
Pickin' a pack of peppers
And puttin' it on your palette
I'm bookin' it, everbody better get it
Them boys ride for that
Trust me, don't nobody get in line for that
Lay your life down on the line for that
Gospel (ain't nobody got time for that)
But these boys got a survival kit
These boys bringin' the Bible in
Cause if they can breathe then they can lead
Show them to the Fathers door

And we work to the birth of a church up in that thing
Better believe the Lord sees us
Haha, yeah, Spirit of God livin' all in us
I go off like my shift's done
I'm on that win that war for Jesus
More glory for my King
I ain't tryna be no preacher, I can't deny what I've seen
I've seen grace straight, shake, break
Tell 'em  make fake, place the hate
Man, I go ape, praise, praise the great God
Who can take a sinner and make him a saint
Amazin' grace
That young and sayin', "Yo, I got my whole life ahead of me and God can have it all"
And look at life through those lenses and see your life is here for the glory of Jesus Christ alone
