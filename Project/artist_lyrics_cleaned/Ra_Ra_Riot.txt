To the edge of the sun where I dropped the gun
A sky above and sky below
One last choice to make now: which way to go?

Say, say, say it now

Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving, absolutely loving
Absolutely loving, absolutely

Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving, absolutely loving
Absolutely loving, absolutely

'Cause if you've got a young soul (Ooooh)
I know which way that I'll go (Ooooh)

(No more holding back)
We're not stopping
It's the year of absolutely being absolutely nothing
Absolutely crushing absolutely everything
Absolutely loving, absolutely loving
Absolutely loving,

Took off all these tight clothes

Took off all these tight clothes
Jumped into the water
I jumped into the water

Vicious demons on the TV
So I sold it on 16th St
But I still hear the drone
