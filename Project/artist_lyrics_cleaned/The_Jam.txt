Something's happening here today
A show of strength with your boy's brigade
And I'm so happy and you're so kind
You want more money, of course, I don't mind
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes
And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got

I'm going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

Some people might get some pleasure out of hate
Me, I've enough already on my plate
People might need some tension to relax
Me, I'm too busy dodging between the flak
You might also like
What you see is what you get
You made your bed, you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and place your trust
As their lies puts you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns
And the public wants what the public gets
But I don't get what this society wants

I'm going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (Going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

La, la-la, la
La, la-la, la

We talk and we talk until my head explodes
I turn on the news and my body froze
These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream

Going underground
I'm going underground
I'm going underground
I'm going underground
La, la-la, la
La, la-la, la
La, la-la, la
La, la-la, la

These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream

Going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout
Going underground (Going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet go pound, pound, pound
Going underground (Going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for
