How can I ever stand it?
Hard to see those two blue eyes
They're shinin' like a diamond
Like a diamond in the sky
(Little Maggie)

Now, march me down to the station
With my suitcase in my hand
I am goin' away for to leave you
I'm goin' to some far distant land
(Eee-hoo)

I would rather be in some lonesome holler
Where the sun could never shine
Than to know you're another man's darlin'
And no longer a darlin' of minе
You might also like
Sometimes I have a nickеl
And sometimes I have one dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars
Just to pay little Maggie's fine

Pretty flowers was made for bloomin'
Pretty stars was made to shine
Pretty girls was made for boys' love
Surely Maggie was made for mine
(I hope so
