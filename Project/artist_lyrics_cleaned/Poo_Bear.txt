I'd kill the whole Titan race
And a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me

Where the crowds would cheer
I'd rub it in Mikasa's face
And my mom keeps saying
That she's always preferred me
I swear someday
I will kill the Titans
I'll bathe in their blood
If I can be strong
I'll cut off their heads
And they'll all be dead
When I kill the Titans
They'll see that I
Was the best all along
Beyond the walls
I'll decapitate
Those walking nightmares
Won't know what to do
And when the last one falls
We'll open up the gates
No one will be scared of
Giant monsters who don't poo

I will kill the Titans
I will make them cry
Maybe eat their stupid moms
Me and Levi's squad
Are going to kill the Titans
'Till I find my hero's welcome
Right where I 

Oh, I'm only worried bout you

A pleasure to have your acquaintance

Oh, no, you take presidents now
Nothing else don't matter
Oh, like 51 Shades, I'mma add a new chapter
Till the bedroom is overflooding, hold on
The way that your curves are engined, it ain't wrong
My medicine come with a warning
You come pick me in the morning
I be there, no time to waste
Make you get hoarse just from moaning
