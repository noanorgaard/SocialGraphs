He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by, they would stop and say
"Oh, my, but that little country boy could play"
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'"

Go, go
Go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. 

You know my temperature's risin'
The jukebox blowin' a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm
And my soul keep a-singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven
Tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rollin' arthritis
Sittin' down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
They rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over, then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues

Well, early in the mornin', and I'm givin' you my warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music won't never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and 

They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin' worked out well
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono
Boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney
Was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can tell


They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly
Love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
"C'est la vie," say the old folks
It goes to show, you never can
