I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Your scent, like storms
Is wild divine
I want your love
All of the time

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
To the other side
Connect me
To the other side
You might also like
Your strange music
Like lucid dreams
The power of you
Transforming me

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
To the other side
Connect me
To the other side

Don’t stop now
Don’t stop now
Don’t stop now
Don’t stop now, don’t stop now
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Don’t stop now
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Don’t stop now
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Don’t stop now
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
Don’t stop now, don’t stop
