I'm on a quest to prove every legible word is connectable
You've stepped into a perpetual new data receptacle
My letter use so indelible it's registered edible
Catch you then compress the breath from you until neck is loose
Strengthen a mass so enemies couldn't harass me
My patience is fast, infinity couldn't outlast me
I write in secrecy at peak speeds
My P.A.D's release a lethal measle breed if i don't keep them in the deep freeze
Bars strange with unlimited linear range
My mind-frames a street with 2021 lanes
I'll change into the baby me and still disable these basic weak fake emcees
With deep phrases using just letters A through E
So truthfully what could you do to me
When I'm the super G who's at the podium reading the Reaper's eulogy
My microphone is several feet long
My speech tones are so strong that when I speak 'em they shatter my own cheek bones
Everyone i hated gets congregated
I'll take your lung out of ya, confiscate it then stomp on it 'til it's uninflated
Greatly underrated yet I'm your favorite
Ill play with your brain and make it so basic that 1 + 1 will look complicated
Check the feeds that my head retrieves
Enemies not yet conceived callin', threatening me
Pressing and yelling and questioning me aggressively
Seekin to get the recipe to my expertise
It's a must to see us humiliate artists publicly
Subjects be deep enough to make hate fall in love with me
The light supplier expired writer of fireworks
One entire verse could make a glass of water die of thirst
I'm using veteran moves, one incredible dude
Hearing two of my songs is like going through medical school
None escape from my monstrous fate
I dominate and concentrate drifting in and out of conscious state
I spit poison ivy when you try me
And just to sit beside me you gotta show a hundred forms of ID
My sickly gifts I can prove quickly
When I stand in the mirror and move, my reflection's scared to move with me
I'm filled with electric type skills
So anytime I write for real I get a $7,000 light bill
I kill and double back after pretending to leave
Then I proceed doing squats, never bending my knees
I'ma press my hands around your neck slow
And even though I saw your final breath I squeezed another month before I let go
I'll leave ya Broken like Depeche Mode
A handwoven flesh robe is the dress code to get into my next show
My work station is the seed of creation
New innovations like spontaious premeditation
I start crushing 'em all with no reluctance involved
Show up and then drop sixty without touching the ball
Proliferate then test the greats
Articulate at such a record pace I made the number one finishing second place
The suit perfer was certain to come produce hurt
Used physics in reverse I built the house and hung the roof first
You're too tasteless audaciously baseless
You flagrently take your patrients to flacious places
Blaze your sanctuary, chasing you away from it's safeness
Then weaken you 'til you can't even raise something that's weightless
I'm breaking company rules
So confident I can run through these fools lyrically while getting my tonsils removed
I'll steer into jet gear, the exosphere exterior threat here
Looking at footage of myself from next year
