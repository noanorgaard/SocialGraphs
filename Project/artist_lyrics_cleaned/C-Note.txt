My homeboy Rico fell in love with Kisha
Full-time freak bitch, part-time teacher
Me and Kisha cool 'cause I used to fuck Tammy
That's her lil' sister, just moved to Miami
Kisha was the driver when I was takin' trips to Mexico
Burnt the head once and I ain't even fuck the ho
Course I told Rico, now Tammy can't stand me
'Fore we fucked the bitches, me and him was like family
And Kisha started hittin' him 'round niggas, shouldn't trust her
Put money over bitches, that's my motherfuckin' brother
Sticking to the G-code, fuck one of these stank hoes
Course I went and told him what she said back to Rico
Rico got mad as hell and started clickin'
Pulled his pistol out and told me stay up out his business
Told me he'd kill me if I ever fuck his bitches
And he ain't pay me shit for them last five chickens
Rico trippin' out, Rico know I ain't no ho
Rico know he should've killed me, Rico know I ain't gon' go
Rico still fuck with Kisha, Kisha still fuckin' off
Rico still owe me a hundred grand and plan on runnin' off
Rico mama know my mama, we like family, Rico smart
But if Rico know what I know, can't no one save him but God
I know Rico ain't no sucker, Rico gutter, he got heart
Rico murked so many men, but his weakness is a broad
Now Rico fuckin' Tammy 'cause he wanna pay back Kisha
Kisha wanna pay back Rico, I don't give a fuck 'bout neither
This bitch Kisha so fucked up, she been fuckin' with that needle
Gave that bitch a couple stacks, she called Rico up to meet her
Rico walked into the house, I was sittin' right on the couch
Rico thought he seen a ghost, Kisha standin' by the door
Rico one shot to the head, Kisha screamin' out, "He dead"
You know I can't leave no witness, Kisha, baow, I fled

If you a real nigga, then you stand for something
Lot of work, never change, gotta stand for something
Man, my heart made of ice and the streets made of gold
One thing about it, I don't love these hoes
Want it 'cause I got it, this is fuckin' nonfiction
Chapter one'll teach you not to love these bitches
Chapter two'll teach you that the game ain't fair
Chapter three'll show you that the streets don't care

Jesse an old-head player, Jesse kind of like my plug
Jesse always got the work, but he don't never show no love
I think Jesse take my money and they front him what he buy
Maybe Jesse a middleman, usin' my shit to get by
Jesse prices be too high, but I heard he work for Nino
Jesse a full-time gambler, he met Nino at the casino
On the cool, Jesse strong, man, I heard he gettin' a C-note
That's a hundred of 'em, might knock his meat out his burrito
Jesse homeboy Dede, he be fuckin' with that white
Dede 'posed to be his goon, he catchin' bodies every night
Me and Dede went to school together, me and Dede tight
Fifth period up in Manaci's class, I was sellin' Dede white
I been playin' under Dede, tryna get up under Jesse
Maybe I'll meet up with Nino and get me a connection
Jesse always gettin' robbed, they don't respect him in the streets
Dede told me Nino always askin' questions 'bout me
But Jesse always shoot me down, Nino got to play it safe
So in other words, Nino do whatever Jesse say
Jesse playin' like he straight, Nino moved back to LA
Dede told me Jesse love some bitches down in MIA
Nino flew us out to Cali, he gon' take us to the Grammys
I pulled up on Jesse, he was front seat with Tammy
Tammy looked me in my eyes, Jesse lookin' at her strange
Thinkin' 'bout what Dede told me, Tammy holdin' Jesse change
Me and Dede in the lobby, told him I was leavin' soon
'Fore I left, I seen that Tammy bitch come out of Nino room
Okay, Nino fuckin' Tammy, Tammy holdin' Nino work
And Jesse ain't got a clue, 'cause if he do, he will be hurt
A long story short, I took a trip to 305
Kicked in that Tammy bitch door and got a hundred-somethin' pies
Now Dede lookin' for me, but he fuck off with my guys
A quarter thing soft, they knocked his brains through his eyes, ugh
Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino
Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino, Nino
