And let me holla at you, baby, for a moment
And if you with it, I’m with it, we'll keep it rollin’
And we’ll be dancin' and drinkin' until the morning
Until the morning, morning
Starters going off
It’s so hot, there’s girls just taking all there clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
'Cause I don’t wanna forget tonight, night, night

Put your lighters in the air
Let 'em burn into the night
And let everybody know
That you're with it and your ready to go

Down like her temperature 'cause to me, she's zero degrees
She cold, over-freeze, I got that girl from overseas
Now she my Miss America, now can I be her soldier, please?
