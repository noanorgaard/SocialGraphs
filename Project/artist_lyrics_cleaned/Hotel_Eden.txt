Confess to the nervousness as we stumble to the close of a troubled chapter
These months have been fun, but we're done
Now the truth burns through, it's a total disaster
But if you could see
What your eyes reflect from your soul, it's revealing
If you could look past
What divides as petty, wondering if you can
What's with loneliness?
Born to widows, won't you let me be?
What's with emptiness?
Back into the shadows, broken and left alone
Rush rush, nimble girl get running, now you wanna run, run, rush rush
Hush hush, nimble girl when you're talking at your friend's house, 'bout, us, us
Done done, nimble girl's done, how you've been talking, it's a shame, now we're really done, done
Don't you dare try to work things out, at least you'll stop your bleeding
What's with loneliness?
Born to widows, won't it let me be?
What's with emptiness?
Back into the shadows, broken and I'm left alone

Won't you ever settle down
If you find your place, and you set your price
Won't you ever comb your hair
It's the trouble they find so appealing
Won't you ever settle down
'Cause you bury your days like you bury your nights
Won't you have a change of heart
It's the cold fire I find so misleading
You might also likeWhat's with loneliness?
Born to widows, won't it let me be?
What's with emptiness?
Back into the shadows, broken and I'm left alone
Nimble girl, show me love
Nimble girl, show me love
Nimble girl, show me love
Nimble girl, show me love
Rush rush, nimble girl get running, now you wanna run, run, run, rush rush
Hush hush, nimble girl when you're talking at your friend's house, 'bout, us, us
Rush rush, nimble girl get running, now you wanna run, run, rush rush
Hush hush, nimble girl, when you're talking at your friends house, 'bout, us, us
Rush rush, nimble girl get running, now you wanna run, run, rush rush
Hush hush, nimble girl, when you're talking at your friends house, 'bout, us, us
It's the one you cast away
Coulda been the one you keep
Not too long left to think
Make your choice and walk
Make your choice and leave
Nimble girl just choose to leave
Show me love, show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love, show me love, show me love
Love, show me love, show me love, show me
