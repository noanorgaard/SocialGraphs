Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(Who he think he is?) Look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't here; ain't nobody else to impress
It's way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Looking so crazy in love's

Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
