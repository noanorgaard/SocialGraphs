Open your eyes, look look, gander gander
Let's make it black and white like a clan of pandas
A heap of zebras
Let's take a peep through my man's uh Samson's
Jeepers creepers, peepers, uh
Pan your cameras to the back of the book where we get them answers, answers
Concordance
I'm on the side line waving to his kingdom
Like a church fan with hands up (Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up)
Like, pick me, pick me
Quickly, quickly
Let me shift steeze on this sick beat
And y'all like "Isn't he in be be-ing just a tincy,wincy grander, grander?"
Nah, I'm showing y'all God's grandeur, grandeur
Through stand-up stanzas
From the hands of man's from
The land of Kenton, better yet the back of Akron
By the grace of God I'm back to rapping
I got my focus
(I got my focus back, man I'm focused)

Where your focus at? Is you focused?
(You can get it back, get it back)
(I'm focused on Jesus Christ)

Look Up was a song by Tye Tribbett
It was number 5 on my Victory Live snippets
Who else but God could speak into my spirit?
Say listen, and then apply to thy lyrics
I get it, keep my face to the sky, keep looking nigh until my eyes get it
I thirst for you, a fiend for my pop's coke
Not smoke but I still look high, get it?
There's music on the air and yeah, I hear it
But if I dwell there, it wears on my addiction
Cos it speaks death so the prayer for my lenses
And the windows to my soul they glare to thy spirit
I'm seeing stardom, repair my vision
Till I'm seeing mirages, prepare my vision
Get my purpose cooked up
Cos yes you're something like Webster, when I need the word I look up, get focused
Look, look and live, live (Uh)
Look, look and live, live (Yeah)
Look, look and live, live (Uh)
Look, look and live, live
I got my focus back, man I'm focused (Man I'm focused)
I got my focus back, man I'm focused
Where your focus at? Is you focused?
Where your focus at? Is you focused?

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
There we go, now turn your dial from Jeezy, adjust your radio
At first it will be some static but that's alright
Cos then you get my Dad's gift, eternal life
Now I'm not aiming at one particular trap star
He's a child of God too, trapped in a rap storm
Speaking to the lifestyle, fallen offspring
Leaking from the lifestyles (Empty mindset, empty mindset, empty mindset)
Concerned with the immediate, that's why folks is lost
Walking by sight with they focus off
Now the picture's blurry and it needs some adjusting
The adjustment is to see we are just men
Be wise, e-y-es we should flush them, rub them
Open 'em, see He is the King
See are nothing, yes us without change
So coin the phrase, heads up
Get your focus
(See He is The King, uh)
Look, look and live, live (Say)
Look, look and live, live
Look, look and live, live (Uh)
Look, look and live, live
I got my focus back
Got it back, got it back
I'm so focused on the Christ right now
Where your focus at? is you focused?
Where your focus at? Is you focused?
You can get it back, get it back
Turn your eyes upon Jesus, man

So my question to you is will you turn your affections unto
The nineteenth book of Testament New?
Hebrews chapter 12, Imma stress on verse 2
For the joy that was set before dude
Jesus Christ taught a lesson to prove
His love that's especially for you
He sits down at the right, so look up cos He left us some room
He died with arms wide, He lived with arms wide
Jesus Christ welcomes the zoo

He's welcoming you man, yeah, with arms wide open
Let's do it, 

I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back

You may have thought you won that last round
You may have laughed, I almost fell down
Maybe you think I give up easy
But it's not over I've got more in me
You thought I stopped you thought I sat down
But I am standing you made me mad now
You got some things I think you owe me
I've come to get back everything that you stole
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back

You hit me hard I should be knocked out
Things I've been through don't even wanna talk about
You crossed the line, you violated me
I want revenge (I want everything back from) A to Z
The battles not mine the battle is the Lord's
In the name of Jesus, I'm taking it by force

I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all back

If you only knew what I was gonna be
after the storm, you wouldn't have even bothered
If you only knew what I was gonna be
after the storm, you wouldn't have even bothered
If you only knew what I was gonna be
after the storm, you wouldn't have even bothered
If you only knew what I was gonna be
after the storm, you wouldn't have even bothered
Devil if you only knew what I was gonna be after the storm
You wouldn't have even bothered me
Yeah
(But now I'm) stronger
(And I got more) power
(I'm a little bit) wiser
(And I got more) strength
(I got thee) anointing
(Got God's) favor
(And we're still) standing
I want it all back

 Rise up!

Rise up people, put on your strength
There's a war going on and we will win
Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail
With power and might, we will stand out
Stand out!
 Stand out!
Be not conformed to this world
 Stand out!
Be transformed, renew your mind
 Stand out!
Just like the three Hebrew boys
 Stand out!

God is playin' it cool, don't wanna rub nobody the wrong way
Almost like we're trying to fit in. Acting like we don't know the name
It's time for us to stand out and go against the grain
Forget tryin' to be down, let the world know you've been changed
How you gonna be the praise leader? But you listen to R & B?
And hip-hop is on your ringtone. I'm trynna tell you God ain't pleased
And since when did it become cool for you to live together unmarried?
Men with men?
Women with women?
I'm tellin you God ain't gon' have it


It's time to recognize
The war it's in disguise
No time for compromise
Wake up open your eyes
 The devil is a LIE!
You must be hot or cold
You can't blend in the crowd
It's time for God's people ta -

Let me hear your war cry!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Let me hear your war cry!

Ooh! (Let's Stand Out!) Ooh! (Let's Stand Out!) Ooh!

Little bit louder
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

One more time!

Ooh! (Cry out loud!) Ooh! (Stand out!) Ooh!
STAND

Baby Icee born on November 8th
Raised in Ohio state, mid-west of the USA
Laid my eyes on Tye Tribbett CD
Seems crazy how it planted the fruit of my dreams
Now, that I'm older, I am a soldier, I am a warrior
Don't follow trends, I follow Christ
He's the Commander
Growing up, I'm in a Marching Band playing drums
God blessed with music I really love
Jesus made the plan, so I can't depend on another man
Headed to the promised land
God got me by His righteous hand
Blessings loading
His Glory is glowing
So I will keep going
I will be soaring
Feel like the Hudson Hornet

One day I will headline arenas spreading the word of God
My only goal is to have my shows filled with the presence of God
Giving God all I got
And I pray it hits the spot
Like you had a good time eating at a restaurant
When I was 16, my Faith was going sideways
I was a lukewarm Christian finding my way
My brother in Christ, Hezekiah, came to me prayed
Fell to my knees and gave Jesus all the praise
Now I'm saved and I'm living unashamed
And I walk by Faith
That's the way I will stay
This is real life
I can't let it go to waste
I've been born again
Now I'm living like a saint
Fast forward to '23
My last year was ending
High school did a talent show
Did my thing as Fresh Icee
I was doing a rap to Trip Lee and Tedashii
I was going off with a bang
And guess what
I got first place
I know God did it
Did I expect it
No I didn't
This was way beyond my control
Gave me the courage to save the ones lost in hope
I'm making Jesus music for every lost soul
I am just your average guy
It's just another day in paradise
I'm just trying to live life
I do it for the Risen Christ

This is How I Live
Yeah, this is How I Live
