Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?
What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost?
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes

The needle on the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you turn from it
It's a quick turn to let us in, yeah

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again, ah-ah
It is happening again

The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
We feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness, infinite quickness, yeah

Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you

From the way that her eyes are shaped
And it's making me sick
With her head on my shoulder
Waking up baby just to believe

For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner

She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another
