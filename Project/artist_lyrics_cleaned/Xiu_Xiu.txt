And I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
La, la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la

That's a razor and you make a threat
That's a razor, make a million billion threats
That's a razor and you make a threat
And I won't rest 'cause I heard it all before
My behind is a beehive
There's a buzz in my backside
My behind is a beehive
And I won't rest while you break my will
Je t'aime the valley
Je t'aime the valley, oh!
Je t'aime the valley
I am an orphan de la vallée

I won't rest until I don't care
I won't rest until I forget about it
La, la, la, la-la, la, la-la,
