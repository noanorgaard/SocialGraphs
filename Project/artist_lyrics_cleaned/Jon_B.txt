How can a man like me
Convince a girl like you
To be his lover and one and only
How can I make you see
That I'm the one for you
And nobody does it like me, baby

Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you come through the night

Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me, oh baby

And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight
And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Where men sometimes ignore
And I'll take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more
