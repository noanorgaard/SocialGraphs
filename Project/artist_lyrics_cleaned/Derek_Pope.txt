Got off a wave, got off a wave
Made a new rome, it's all in a day
Swapping the name, swapping the face
Had me a dime, needed some change
Life is a movie, I'm living in frames
I switched up the game, but I do remain
I'll never be sane, no, never be the same
Purple I steamroll I'm paving the way
She hit me when I'm in the bay
I'm up here what you want me to say?
I'm not flying back to down to LA
You get me but you got to wait
Jungle it's all about the chase
You need to come down from space
Stashing the zip in the waist
I need them bills in a case

Hollywood girl but she live in the oaks
Workin apparel to spend it on clothes
She roll it up, she get it all on her own
I stay afloat, we just keep rocking the boat
City holding everyone's fears
I am just a transplant here
Have to learn the wheel before you steer
