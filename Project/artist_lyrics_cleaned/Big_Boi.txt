Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)

Time and time again, I gotta turn back 'round and tell these hoes
That I am the HNIC, bitch, that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit that'll have you on that "I don't want no more"
At this time, I need all my freak hoes to get down on the floor (Ayy)
If you came to rep your set (Ayy), right now, nigga, let 'em know (Ayy)
If it's jail I get for stompin' a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Freak, I'll be off in a week
Straight geeked, swerving down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23s on the feet
The Legend, Rocky D Brown
Back in town to beat you down
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A, cliqued up, picked up with some PIs that don't play
On that Kryptonite, we stay so high, we might fly away
You might also like
I be on that Kryptonite, straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that Kryptonite
I be on that Kryptonite, straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that Kryptonite

I-I-I-I-I be on it all night, man, I be on it (Day— day) all day
Straight up pimp, if you want me, you can find me in the A

Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)

Time and time again, I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes
I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we sling that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Toke the 'dro and I'm on probation
My blunts, I don't be lacing
I'm on that Kryptonite (Oh)
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run, tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets, Big Boi, he put us on
Chevy riders slingin' powder, Simpson Road to Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against that wood, candy paint, spinning wheels
Grind Time Rap Gang member, bitch, it's Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp

I be on that Kryptonite, straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that Kryptonite
I be on that Kryptonite, straight up on that Kryptonite
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that Kryptonite

I-I-I-I-I be on it all night, man, I be on it (Day— day) all day
Straight up pimp, if you want me, you can find me in the A

Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
Ayy (I'm on it), ayy (I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)
Time and time again, I gotta turn back 'round and tell C-Bone
Grab that cologne out my bookbag, I smell dro all on you, homes
Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folk gon' trip
Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
'Cause you just ain't gon find no yay
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
They play dirty, he can't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me
