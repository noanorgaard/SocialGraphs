You are being herded by the wolves
A generation of mockingbirds
Feeding yourself to the wolves

This is the rise of our demise
Fucked up and uncivilized
This is the rise of our demise
You paint a target right between your eyes

Collateral damage in the aggregates
Structural analysis of duplicates
Errors of illusion, clouded perspectives
Terrorized delusions and endgame objectives
Locked out, a stiff tactical suture
A victim complex now reality
Blocked ground, a swift statistical maneuver
Persecution of the self-made weak

This is the rise of our demise

You paint a target right between your eyes

And now is the moment when everything can change
You are completely responsible for your own life
And no one is coming to save you from yourself
So, stop blaming your problems on any and everything else
It does not matter one tiny fucking bit
How unfair you think the world is
It's only what you do right here, right now
Right this fucking instant that matters, it's your choice to

Lycanthropic survival instincts
Embrace the beast and shun the weak
Awake the primal one that sleeps inside
Or feel the shiver running through your spine

The time is slipping by, no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite

My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself, I've become someone else
My hands are painted red, my hands are painted red

Schizophrenic amnesia
Bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
Forget the only life that you knew outside

Another number quickly learns the rules
A hidden burner waits to point at you
A subtle gesture, and you're ventilated
Talk isn't cheap here, bleed out in payment
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time

Another day
Spent buried in the shadow of your doubt
Always the same
But still, you refuse to figure out
Always the same

You will destroy you
Distorted, tore yourself in two
Your will absorbs you
You can't ignore you anymore

An entitled declaration of distress
Strife, misery, and the pursuit of unhappiness
Endless complaining, no accountability
The reek of privilege and weightless tragedy

Cry wolf on your silken pillow
Clipped wings beneath a crooked halo
A perfect child who never looks at the mirror
Right in your face, but not any clearer
A problem hidden in plain view
It's staring right back at you

All the world's a stage
But you are the only player
A black hole in the center of the universe
A dark cloud of despair
Caught in an endless rut
A crisis without solution
Someone should stitch your mouth shut
And solve your fucking problem
Strife, another day
And misery
Always the same

Are you ready for the night?

Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words, and then I'm done
How the fuck did you think this would end?

Foul, parasitic imposition

Loaded and indolent

This is a tarnished heirloom
Passed down through iron fists
A shameful house of doom
A legacy of collapse, built on a painful truth

A thousand years of failure
A thousand years, they bled

They just bowed their heads

They meekly did their time
Counting the days
While harnessed to their rusty shackles
Forever occupied
Folded the crimson star
The rabbits turned to jackals

Waiting for this endless night to color into dawn
