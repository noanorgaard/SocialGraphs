Just bring it over here, turn your phone off
Leave them heels on, take your clothes off
Don't wanna see no one else, girl I'm all yours tonight, tonight

Sex ain't never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me, belongs to me
I want my hands tattooed on your body, baby
Sex ain't never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me, belongs to me
I'll be your sex slave
Sex ain't never felt better, babe

Let's make a movie, you steal the show
You can be my leading lady, baby anything goes
Let the bed be the set, cause I know you on some freak shit
Girl I really like what you be doing
So cancel all your plans
Cause tonight anything goes baby
Make your way over here
Don't you keep me waiting too long for that body



I know what you're looking for
You ain't gotta search no more
Baby let me run the show
Hold on, it's a bumpy ride so don't let go
Hard for me to leave, once you start to ride on
That was made for me, let me keep the light on
Just so I can see, your body begging me for more
In the bed or on the floor
