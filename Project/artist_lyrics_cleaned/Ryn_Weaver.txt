And then I found me a lover who could play the bass
He's kinda quiet, but his body ain't
Spend the days dreaming and the nights awake
Doin' things we know we shouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

Says he can't believe he found me
Wraps his arms around me
Yeah-eah, eah-eah-eah-yeah

I can't let him in
You call me up and ask me how I've been
I'll call your bluff and
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
No, I can't let him in
You play me rough, but I won't let you win
So, call my bluff, I'll
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
You might also like
Count down to the day they may come true

And I fell for a vagabond, a month at tops
Lied and said his bike was in the "motor shop"
Drove my car once and made the tire pop
Still we had some fun, till I came to
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

On the Fourth of July, I met a man, "Pierre"
Lied about his age, but I didn't care
Spoke in broken English but the heart was there
In those eyes of sky and ocean blue
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

He says he can't believe he found me
Wraps his arms around me
Yeah-eah, eah-eah-eah-yeah

I can't let him in
You call me up and ask me how I've been
I'll call your bluff and
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
No, I can't let him in
You play me rough, but I won't let you win
So, call my bluff, I'll
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies
Count down to the day they may come true
I'm counting dow-ow-ow-ow-own
I'm still so dow-ow-ow-ow-own
I'll come 

Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
You might also like
Watch it, watch it

Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains

Deep in the trench of the crossfire
You shot me down from the live wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating and now I can't play

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
Hit the ground running up from you
Baby, you know I don't want to, no, I want you
But there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me
I see so plainly, but there's nothing left to say
I should have known, I should have known
Known, no, no-no-no-no...

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

(Ahh, all around)
(Ahh, all around)
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch
