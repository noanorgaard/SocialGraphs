You better know, know, know
That I have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I, I, I, want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run, run, run
Before I decide that
You are mine, two stars will collide
You better run, run, run
Nowhere to run
But to me

Somehow I don't get the picture
Don't know why you are the winner
Our love is not what we wanted
But, baby, you finish just what you started
So you said "Why even bother
Set this love set me on fire"
How I wish you'd know me better
So you'd see what I'm trying to say
You might also like
You better know, know, know
That I have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I, I, I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run, run, run
Before I decide that
You are mine, two stars will collide
You better run, run, run
Nowhere to run
But to me

You are the cause of all this pain and
You are the reason I'm upset
You are the cause of all this pain
But you are the cause of all this love
You are the thing I can't forget

You better know, know, know
That I have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I, I, I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run, run, run
Before I decide that
You are mine, two stars will collide
You better run, run, run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know, know, know
That I have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I, I, I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run, run, run
Before I decide that
You are mine, two stars will collide
You better run, run, run
Nowhere to run
But to me
You better know, know, know
That I have conditions
I make the rules
And make the decisions
And I, I, I want nothing less than
What I deserve
So you better run, run, run
Before I decide that
You are mine, two stars will collide
You better run, run, run
Nowhere to run
But to
