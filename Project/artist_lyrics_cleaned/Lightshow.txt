We got the all the drugs, we just need the lighters
We got army guns like the fucking fighters
Let that bitch convince me, pop a half, I might swerve
Talk her out her panties if I say the right words
Promise I don't think I could get any higher
Had to write a thank you note to my supplier
Please don't cut them lights on when I'm riding by, sir
Please don't cut them lights on, I am smoking fire

Cut the lights on, fuck it, cut the lights off, diamonds lit
Couple VVS's on my neck the way my diamonds hit
I was 13, robbin' niggas, drinking that brown bitch
Riding in a drop with a Glock and a fucking stick
VVS all on my neck, hold up
100 round drum in that TEC, hold up
Pull up on you in a 'Vette, hold up
Pull up, bitches break their neck, hold up
Pull up on you in a ghost, hold up
Pull up, break your bitch's throat, hold up
Niggas think I make money rapping but bitch I'm still selling dope
I'm in DC with my nigga Lightshow
Went to Avianne now my fucking ice glow
And I keep a pistol everywhere that I go
I don't need no fucking shooter, young Savage gon' blow

We got the all the drugs, we just need the lighters
We got army guns like the fucking fighters
Let that bitch convince me, pop a half, I might swerve
Talk her out her panties if I say the right words

Please don't cut them lights on when I'm riding by, sir
Please don't cut them lights on, I am smoking fire
Please don't hit the lights, that shit is bright
Please don't hit the lights, this prescription in my Sprite
Please don't hit the lights, chopper on the seat inside
Please don't hit the lights, I might have to spend the night
At the jailhouse, wait inside that bitch 'til I get bailed out
Outed by a black cop, damn he a sellout
Most these niggas rats, they walkin' 'round here with they tail out
Ain't eyeballing shit, I whip this motherfucking scale out
I thank god for rap but I'm a motherfucking trap god
Lot of niggas down so my first speed dial is my strap guy
I didn't go to college, I rap automatics, cap guys
Finna pull up really really  deep like a capper
We get product and we split that shit up like a hot pie
My bitch like to cook, hope she put lobster in the potpie
AR-15 bullet 'bout the same length as a hot fry
Wore that bitch's own designer bag like a fly guy

We got the all the drugs, we just need the lighters
We got army guns like the fucking fighters
Let that bitch convince me, pop a half, I might swerve
Talk her out her panties if I say the right words
Promise I don't think I could get any higher
