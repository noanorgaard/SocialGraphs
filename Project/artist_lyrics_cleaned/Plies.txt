I done came back from pissin' inside the Trump Hotel
'Fore I take it in, I got to catch me one more sell
Name saved up under "Febreze" 'cause she ain't got no smell
I can hit it from the back, ain't got to hold my breath
All these hundreds on me got me startin' to look like a scammer
All that ass she got back there startin' to look like a pamper
Pull up on your ass with a bag just like I'm Santa
Plug name Julio but he don't play for Atlanta
The only millionaire you know that wear Dope Boy Ree's
You ain't never fucked a nigga that had this much cheese
I'm just tryna run you crazy like they tried Kanye
Treat you like the mailman, make you come once a day (Yeah)

Baby, you know I'm out here in these streets, I gotta get it
If I ain't on the corner, I'm in the 'yo, bae, I be busy
But you gotta pray for me 'cause these niggas be hatin' in my city
And you gotta thank God everyday he be lettin' you be with me
I'ma get in that lil' pussy like I'm just gettin' outta prison
And word around town, he bagged a nigga but he didn't

And ain't nothin' changed because I motherfuckin' made it
I'm a real hitter, I'm a real nigga, I'ma treat you like a lady

I get your hair done so much, they start to think you a beautician
These lil' niggas tryna come up, only reason they diss me
Your last man bought you Bebe but I'll buy you Givenchy
Biggest thing he ever did for you was take you to Chili's
Keep a bank in my pocket, call me Plies Fargo
Sex game undefeated, think I'm a hundred to nought
I don't go nowhere for free, if you got a check, I'll go
Your last man, he was petty, tell him I said so
I be hustling so hard, I lose track of the days
That lil' pussy was so sorry, I called it minimum wage

I jus' gave her a nick name, it's "Wet-Wet"
'Cause when we finished, she mess up all the bed sets
She got somethin' to relax me when I'm under stress
Never told her or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'd of told me it was this good, I'd of never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My bust it baby, I keep her on deck

It ain't no fakin' nigga, you see the gear I'm in
Baby nine on me, easy to cuff it then
I feel invincible, I'm on that cup of Henn'
Extended clip in this bitch, it shoot more than ten
Put on that black tee, took off that Polo man
Try to slide on me, and I'mma spray yo' ass
And in my back pocket, I keep that black mask
And let him run down, I bet I flip his ass
I'm ridin' tinted window, no mo' clear glass
One thing about me, nigga, you know I don't flag
I keep one in the head, no time to cock it back
You know I mean business, when I'm in all black

I'm on some other shit, I'm dressed in all black
I'm with my niggas them, and all of us strapped
We on that killer shit, somebody gettin' whacked

Just had a dream, dog, killed my first rap nigga
I hit him with that yopper, was such a sad picture
I let that yopper go, hit him with five quick ones
All headshots, shoot nothin' but straight missiles
R.I.P. dog, rest in peace, pussy nigga
I prefer yoppers, them bullets get there quicker
I've been attracted to them, ever since I was little
I'm dressed in all black, just like a fuckin' killer
