Oh, love, it changes shapes; it glows in many shades
We won't be gone as long as our echoes resonate
We need no photographs; the past's not only past
I find us everywhere and that's how the magic lasts

'Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love

It's only little things: footmarks and fingerprints, a treasure hunt through town
It's full of evidence, our monuments are all around
Everything's on the move; the paint is wet, all colors are new
But if you look carefully, you'll see us shining through

'Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love

We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We're in the air, we're in the water
From the rooftops down to the pier
I'll never walk these streets alone
(We were here, we were here, we were really here)
We're in the air, we're in the water
Engraved into waves; invisible ink on the walls
We were here, we were here, we were really

Vybz Kartel - First Week Out - 

And she tries to tell the nights apart
By the state of the heart and the shape of the moon
A hotel room is a hotel room is a hotel room

362 do not disturb
If no one knows, no one gets hurt
He turns off his mobile phone
He's never been this far from home
A stranger's skin and unknown scent
He wonders where his conscience went
The stranger smiles and blows a kiss
Wake-up call, quarter to six

And he tries to tell the nights apart
By the state of the heart and the shape of the moon
A hotel room is a hotel room is a hotel room
Yeah, they try to tell the nights apart
By the state of the heart and the shape of the moon
A hotel room is a hotel room is a hotel room

Short stories on every floor
Checking in and checking out
Nothing to write home about

Just a temporary place
For nameless neighbors in the dark
Wall to wall but worlds apart

I got 101, my lucky number
Windows open, wind of summer
(A hotel room is a hotel room is a hotel room)
And I hang my dress and turn the lights out
It's probably too late to call now

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart and

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I watch the sky change to a darker blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singer sounds as if she was longing
As if she was longing, too

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start

And seven little numbers, baby, they could make a change
Seven little numbers make a fire out of this flame

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all?
For me at all, tell me
I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all?
