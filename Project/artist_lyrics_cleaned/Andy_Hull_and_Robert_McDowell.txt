Now we killed a raccoon
We are using your body
Like it's a machine gun
Now we are shooting some fish!
Our friendship is blossoming
Let's eat the stuff we killed
Now we started a fire
You might also like
I have to admit, I'm enjoying your company
Are we falling in love?

All we've ever needed is a montage
I'm hanging from vines and I'm dancing
D-d-d-d-d-dancing
Wooooooooo!
Truuuuuuuue
Frieeeeeeeeendship!
