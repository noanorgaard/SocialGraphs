I miss you, where'd you go?
I think about it sometimes
And I think you should know
That I loved you, don't forget
Picture the memories we shared
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Ohh

I miss all the long drives
Getting lost with you by my side
It never was a worry, never in a hurry
To get you home at night
And now I'm telling stories
To feel you once more on my lips
But words are kind of boring
Can't take it no more, I miss
You might also like
I miss you, where'd you go?
I think about it sometimes
And I think you should know
That I loved you, don't forget
Picture the memories we shared
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Ohh

Your long brown hair would blow in the wind
Now, baby, I start to forget
Everything that I once knew
But I still have that picture you drew
I keep it safe here on my desk
I'd throw it away but it's all I got left of you
Except, your perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette

I miss you, where'd you go?
I think about it sometimes
And I think you should know
That I loved you, don't forget
Picture the memories we shared
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
Perfect silhouette
