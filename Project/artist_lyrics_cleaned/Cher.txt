Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

"Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you'd hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey
Hey
Hey

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and then it eased my pain
Now the dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
My Sunny, once shines so sincere
Sunny, once so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine you gave to me
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel that I'm ten feet tall
Sunny, once so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
Somehow I was torn like a wind blown sail
Then our love was born when you held my hand

Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
And then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said, "The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you!
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!"

So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I snuck back and caught her with my man
Laughing and kissing 'til they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor
Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore

And I remember the thunder
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby

I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone
Since you've been gone

Dry your eyes
I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings that you never really knew

But baby, don't you loose that thunder
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And Papa would'a shot him if he knew what he'd done
