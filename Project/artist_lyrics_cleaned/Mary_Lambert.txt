Even when I'm hurting I know that this is worth it
Tell me it'll be alright
Gotta give me something to get me through the nothing
One more night

Kiss me like the world is gonna disappear
I'm a better person when I have you here
I got you, and I can get through
Anything as long as I can see your face
Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far away

I don't need a map to tell me where you are
You and I, we come from the same star
Every day is a heartache
And every night I lie awake
I'm reminded the bed is only half mine

Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time
Nobody's got the time for love
Nobody's got the time

Right now you're so far away, so far away
You're so far away, so far 

I've got bipolar disorder
My shit's not in order
I'm overweight, I'm always late
I've got too many things to say
I rock mom jeans, cat earrings
Extrapolate my feelings
My family is dysfunctional
But we have a good time killing each other

They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

I can't think straight, I'm so gay
Sometimes I cry a whole day
I care a lot, use an analog clock
And never know when to stop
And I'm passive aggressive
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist
I love my butt and won't shut up
And I never really grew up

They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
