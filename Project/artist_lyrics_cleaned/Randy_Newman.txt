But I must admit it
Big guy, you always come through
I wouldn’t have nothin' if I didn’t have you

You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothin' to me
Nothing to me

Oh, hi! We’re rehearsing, uh, a scene for the upcoming company play called "Put that Thing Back Where It Came From, Or so Help Me!"
It's a musical
(sung)
Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me!
Get that thing away from me, you guys!
Put that thing back where it came from
Or I'll poke myself in the eye!
(spoken)
Heh heh. It's a work in progress, it's gonna get better

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this year's company play starring, written, and directed by Mike...

And produced!

And produced by Mike Wazowski. Oh

Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me
So help me!
So help me get by
Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me
So help me!
I just gotta cry
You're seated right over there, sir

"Boo!"

There's a child, there's a child, there's a human child
Running 'round the restaurant
This is really wild!
What in heaven's name will become of us
We, who are living in Monstropolis?!

Alright, Wazowski, tell us where the kid is!

I will never talk. Never!
(sung)
She's out of our hair
And just when I dare to care
She says, "Au contraire, you're my pair of friends. I love you."

And so, we put that kid back where she came from
And she helped us to find a better tomorrow today!
Thank you! What a night for my mother to be in the audience, ladies and gentlemen! My mom! Thank you, Monstropolis!

I don't have to say it
(I'll say it anyway)
'Cause we both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have... you

One more time!
It worked!

I don't have to say it

I'm gonna anyway!

'Cause we both know it's true

Let's take it home big guy!

I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have

You

You! You!
A–E–I–O

That means you!
