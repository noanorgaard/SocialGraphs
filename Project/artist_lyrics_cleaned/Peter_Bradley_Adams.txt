I know i don't know you, but there's somewhere I've seen you before
Whatever your name is, whatever you do
There's nothing between us I'm willing to loose
Just call me if ever our paths may climb
I want you to call me under these darkened sky's
Whoever you love, whoever you kiss
The wandering between us I'm willing to miss
Now I'm drifting out over deep oceans
And the tide won't take me back in
And these desperate nights I'll call you again and again
There's comfort, comfort in things we believe
Other than danger, wanting the things i can't see
Where ever you live now, where ever you walk
There's distance between us I'm willing to cross
Now I'm drifting out over deep oceans
And the tide won't take me back in
And these desperate nights I'll call you again and again
Now I'm drifting out over deep oceans
And the tide won't take me back in
And these desperate nights I'll call you again and again
Hey stranger or may i call you my own
I know i don't know you, but there's somewhere I've seen you beforeSee Peter Bradley Adams LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also
