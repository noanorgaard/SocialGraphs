To holding over so long
And noticed how strong I am but deeply torn
I gave you my all but it seems to me (this so called love isn't meant to be)
But my destiny is waiting, so I'ma run for it
It's been there for a while and gonna ignore it
My state of denial is over, I had a heavyweight lifted off my shoulder
When you hit rock bottom the only way is to go up
 my dream
From the bottom to the top, never stop, keep it moving and believe
Huh, I got a goal to achieve
And by the way my predication is (I'ma be on the top of the world)
No one can hold me back but myself
And that's my word
So am I wrong?

So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel, trying to reach the things that I can't see
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?
That's just how I feel, that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel, trying to reach the things that I can't see

There is something more
Something more

I stopped believing in love
So I've been forcing it out
Said I been living a lie
I knew it when I looked in your eyes
I'm the king of the world when you stand by my side
Can we fill the tank up and drive through the night?
I've been saving up, I don't wanna waste time
Leave it all behind, put it all on the line, oh
Can you give me one more night?
'Cause I'm 'bout to make this right
Tell me what you got to lose
You're intrigued, you know it's true
And we can see another day
With no more lies and no mistakes
Don't let the devil talk you through

There is something more

On the side, on the side

Intrigued by you
There's something more to you
Something more to you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

They tried to break me down, but I'm still on my feet
This city's full of life, so why is it hard to breathe?
Oh, why did God create this world so unfair?
I don't know

Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay when I lie down in your arms
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I feel like moving back, sometimes it's hard to dream
The life I chose is passed, it's moving without me
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time?
I don't know

My time went by too fast, there is no one left but me
I have got a nine to five and it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end

But I'm okay when I lie down in your arms
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
