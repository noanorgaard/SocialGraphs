Don't know when and I don't know why

You're the only reason I keep on comin' home

Sweet pea, what's all this about?

You're the only reason I keep on comin' home

I'm like the Rock of Gibraltar, I always seem to falter
And the words just get in the way
Oh, I know I'm gonna crumble and I'm trying to stay humble
But I never think before I say


Sweet pea, keeper of my soul
I know sometimes I'm out of control

When she wakes me
She takes me back home

All the colors fade
When you're gone
No New Year's Day parade
You're gone
Colors seem to fade

Your mama called, she said
That you're downstairs crying
Feeling like such a mess
Yeah, I hear ya
In the background bawling
What happened to your sweet summer-time dress?

I know we all
We all got our faults
We get locked in our vaults
And we stay
