Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law

When the band started playing, the watermelon queen
Said let me show you something that you ain't never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go
She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed
She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She crawled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl
