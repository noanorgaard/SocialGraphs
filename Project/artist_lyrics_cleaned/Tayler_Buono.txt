You keep me up in the night, I stay up wondering
Am I yours? Are you mine? Are we more than a thing?
Ya want my love, want it all, but it's torturing me
Emotionally, yeah

It's not even fair
That you don't have to feel this
That you don't have to care
I’m stuck in this confusion
'Cause I'm technically single, emotionally unavailable
Technically single, emotionally unavailable

Sick and tired of pretending
It's obvious we're more than friends
I'm not cool with this if you're not intending
To be together, don’t go wastin' my heart
You might also like
Don't wanna lose me or see me with some other guy
But what am I supposed to do if I can't call you mine?
Give me no choice but move on 'cause there's no you and I
Technically yeah

It's not even fair
That you don't have to feel this
That you don't have to care
I’m stuck in this confusion
'Cause I'm technically single, emotionally unavailable
Technically single, emotionally unavailable


It's not even fair
That you don't have to feel this
That you don't have to care
I’m stuck in this confusion
'Cause I'm technically single, emotionally unavailable
Technically single, emotionally
