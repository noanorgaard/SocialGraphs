And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"

Sing along to a song that I know
It goes a bah-bah-bada, sing it over and over
Let it hypnotize you
I'm still here right beside you
Hold my hand, you can follow my lead
You're like a ballerina twirling 'round on your feet
And watching is so fantastic
I want to ask you
You might also like
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Now collapse, take delight in the fall
And catch your breath, I know you feel the ring from it all
So try and collect yourself now
It's just the euphoric comedown

And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"
'Cause I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark
And I told you to come
And you followed where I asked you to go
You'd go
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new 

Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark
Without you, I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight
I know that I can make it out
With you, I know I'll make it out alive

Let me know your secret, tell me
How you color all the empty space
Drawn outside the lines, your world's a
Vibrant illustration you create
You might also like
Chasing you, I'm falling through
The rabbit hole
Deep down into an old slope
Evenly, you're pulling me
Ever faster as we go
Spinning out of control

Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark
Without you, I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight
I know that I can make it out
With you, I know I'll make it out alive
Just take me where you go
When it gets dark
Without you, I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight
I know that I can make it out
With you, I know I'll make it out
