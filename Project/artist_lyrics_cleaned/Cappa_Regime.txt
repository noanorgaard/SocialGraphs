In the morning, in the evening, you can drink it hot or cold
And you can take it without sugar, or give it to your mother
It's the darling of the morning, a decent cup of tea
You can drink the mugs galore and your head is never sore
If you're stepping at a party and you're dancing jigs and reels
And whiskey drinkers will be whining with the shaking and the crying;
In the morning they'll be dying for a decent cup of tea
Oh, them Hindus in New Delhi, keep the warmth in your belly
On a cold and frosty morning just to keep your toe-nails warm
I don't care for chocolate toffee, you can keep your beer and coffee
Just give me a singing kettle as it sits upon the stove
Every Tom and Dick and Harry loves the tay you get from Barry
He makes it brown and black and every color in between
Oriental Mr. Mewley has the tay that's good for hooleys
At a wake or at a party with butter milk and cream
Mr. Lyons has the cuppa for your dinner and your supper
And there's Tetley's, Lipton's, they have quality and brand
And health, if you are ailing, take a mug of old Darjeeling
Or sip upon exotic tea from China or Japan
Old women like to gossip while down their trunk they toss it
Old fellas like to drink it just to pass the time away
The navvy with a shovel, now without his tay is trouble
If he doesn't get his break now with his sandwiches and tay
You might also likeThe Brit he sips it nicely, the Yankee likes it icy
The Japanese and Russians and the Arab likes his brew
Can drink now as you please, give a cheer for them Chinese
They love to take a sip and sweet and sour with a stew
Oh, them Hindus in New Delhi, keep the warmth in your belly
On a cold and frosty morning just to keep your toe-nails warm
I don't care for chocolate toffee, you can keep your beer and coffee -
Give me a singing kettle as it sits upon the stove
Country men, reggae, and heavy metal rockers
All wish for the kettle when the show it is a stopper
The football, hurling men, and rugby when they're trying
All run for the kettle when the whistle blows for time
For breakfast and lunch and your supper and your dinner
Everybody loves the cuppa, now the saints and the sinners
For tea is very sure, it's the remedy and cure
For to straighten up a fellow and to send him on his way
We drink it in the morning, just before the day is dawning
And we take it strong or weak with the Turk or with the Greek
The clergy with their collars and the Yankee with his dollars
All love to take a drop of milk and sugar in their tea
Oh, them Hindus in New Delhi, keep the warmth in your belly
On a cold and frosty morning just to keep your toe-nails warm
I don't care for chocolate toffee, you can keep your beer and coffee -
Just give me a singing kettle as it sits upon the stove
All the politicians and the men in high positions:
Fianna Gaelers, Fianna Fáilers, every tart that chocked the Dáilers
The whingers and the bawlers, the scroungers and the stallers
They love to take it sipping with a biscuit or a bun
At a wake or at a party, you can take it strong and hearty
You can boil the water rosy, you can warm it in a cozy
You can read the year that's coming, you can tell what's up and running
Just by looking at the tea-leaves at the bottom of the cup
Oh, them Hindus in New Delhi, keep the warmth in your belly
On a cold and frosty morning just to keep your toe-nails warm
I don't care for chocolate, toffee, you can keep your beer and coffee -
Just give me a singing kettle as it sits upon the stove
Oh, them Hindus in New Delhi, keep the warmth in your belly
On a cold and frosty morning just to keep your toe-nails warm
I don't care for chocolate toffee, you can keep your beer and coffee -
Just give me a singing kettle as it sits upon the
