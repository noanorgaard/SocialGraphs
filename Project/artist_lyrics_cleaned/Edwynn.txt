Some people laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this, dreadful
Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking

Some laugh too fast
Some only blast
Others, they twitter like birds

You know, you're as bad as he is

Then there's the kind
What can't make up their mind
You might also like
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak as the squeakelers do
I've got to let go with a ho-ho-ho
And a ha-ha-ha too

We love to laugh, loud and long and clear
We love to laugh, so everybody can hear
The more you laugh, the more you fill with glee
And the more the glee, the more we're a merrier
