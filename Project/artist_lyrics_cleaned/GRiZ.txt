Just want to move and feel out on the floor

To see if both our feet make flow (flow, come on now)
No I don't want too much
But the way you look I can't ignore (No, no, no, no)
I want to get closer to you baby! (Hey!)
See if there is something more, more, more, more (Give it to me!)

I want to dance, want to sing to the rhythm of the beat

Feeling all right, feeling all right (Can you feel me?)
Feeling all right, feeling all right (Can you feel me?)
Feeling all right, feeling all right (Can you feel me?)
Feeling all right, feeling all right (Can you feel me?)
Come 'on now, let it feel me
