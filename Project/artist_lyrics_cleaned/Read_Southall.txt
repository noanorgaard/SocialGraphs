So why did you leave?
Cause it don't make no sense to me

My friends say I'm still a good time
People still say I can dance
And my daddy's still my best friend
And I still starch my shirts and pants
I still believe in the word of God
And I'm still chasing all our plans
And my eyes are still that shade of blue
Still got calluses on my hand
Yeah my hair is still long and shaggy
And I still love to pick guitar
You said you loved everything about me
I guess the moon and back it ain't that far
It ain't that far
You might also like
Lay and stare at the ceiling a while
Live a pretty rough lifestyle
Now that you're gone I do just about anything that I want to
My buddy's love having me around
Hide the pain from the whole damn town
But the truth is and always will be that I miss you

So why did you leave
Guess the moon and back is far enough for me

My friends say I'm still a good time
People still say I can dance
And my daddy's still my best friend
And I still starch my shirts and pants
I still believe in the word of God
And I'm still chasing all our plans
And my eyes are still that shade of blue
Still got calluses on my hand
Yeah my hair is still long and shaggy
And I still love to pick guitar
You said you loved everything about me
I guess the moon and back it ain't that far
It ain't that far
It ain't that far
I guess the moon and back it ain't that
