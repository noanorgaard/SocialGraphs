Waves crash, weighin' me down
I'm lost
Just when I think it's getting better
You always find a way to make me feel so little again
And lost
Rewind our time, never forget you
Late in the night, running around
With blues in my heart, working loose in my chest
It's a question marked and a space in my head
With you
Love me, love me 'cause I don't love myself
The crazy thing is I know nothing else
Love me, love me 'cause I don't love myself
I know nothing else
Stop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
You might also likeStop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
Not this time, I'll just forget you
Early to rise, a running regret
Bruises on my heart
But clear in my head
It's a hard-drive crash
Memories wiped of you
Love me, love me 'cause i don't love myself
The crazy thing is i know nothing else
Stop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
Stop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
I go through the change to make me happy
Already laughed all the hurt away, yeah yeah yeah
I'm at 100, never slowing down
In the fast lane 'cause it's all I know now
‘Cause your problem is a problem of the past
Baby
No more chains
And no more games
If living is freedom
Then freedom is pain
Stop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
Stop that looking at me
What you wanna talk about?
Talk is cheap, baby
All your problems end up problems for me
All your problems end up problems for me, for me, baby
I go through the change to make me happy
Already laughed all the hurt away, yeah yeah yeah
I'm at 100, never slowing down
In the fast lane 'cause it's all I know now
‘Cause your problem is a problem of the past!
Love me, love me 'cause i don't love myself
The crazy thing is i know nothing else
Love me, love me 'cause i don't love myself
The crazy thing is i know nothing
