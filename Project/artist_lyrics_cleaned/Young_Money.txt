Nagle praży słońce mnie na Cyprze
Jazda lewą stroną drogi, to jest trochę dziwne
Wszędzie palmy i turyści, którzy robią zdjęcia
A jak jesteś w Ayia Napie, nocą nie chodź po imprezkach

Później zwiedzam Gran Canarię z moim ziomkiem
Pływamy na deskach i żyjemy swobodnie
Nie mam czasu na problemy, kiedy świeci słońce
Nie mam czasu na problemy, kiedy piję (o-o-o)
Nowy Rok - kierunek Kopenhaga
By zobaczyć brata i trochę z nim pogadać
O-o-o, o-o-o
Palę jointa, mordo to , yo

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night

Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites

And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view
So I can see how niggas went wrong and how the plays was drawn
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is wicked, niggas is blitzin', you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all-star QB
Or the top on an high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories like I do
And every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peepin' me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?"
You lookin' for answers? I don't got none, huh
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats (Yeah)
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm gettin' money, nigga, yeah

Hello world

Uh-huh
Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all

You can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some special ed shit
The magnificent, twisted like a dread, bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no, I never choke, but I strangle beats
And I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a Cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedalin' my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be peddlin' the six-speed white?
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are a female dog, you don't fight
Bitch-ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich-ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch-ass nigga, I ain't got no master
