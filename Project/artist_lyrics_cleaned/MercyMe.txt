That keep tellin' me I'm not right

When others say I'll never be enough
And greater is the One living inside of me

And greater is the One living inside of me
Than he who is living in the world

Bring your doubts and bring your fears
Bring your hurt and bring your tears
There'll be no condemnation here
You are holy, righteous and redeemed
