Niggas is haters, I'm doin' deals like the majors
Ice Cream sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some Bapestas
Bulletproof under T-shirts because they hate us
Do like Snoop say, step your game up
Double-decker boat nigga, Meditterane' up
D-Class Asscher cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberace fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughin'
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Italian heartthrobs could not get rid of me
Up in Donatella crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, "Give me that Enzo" (Yes,sir)
I know what you thinkin', "Yeah, me too"
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

Been two years like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
Streets was yours, you're dunce cappin' and kazooin'
I was just assumin' you'd keep the coke movin'
But I got one question, what the fuck y'all been doin'? (Come on)
Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs
The full-length cat, when I wave, the kitty purrs (Meow)
All my niggas caked up, sellin' gray and beige dust
Have that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase or duck, we only race for bucks
Peel money rolls 'til our thumbs get the paper cuts
Chill, retardo, South Beach Gallardo
Teal started up, go brrr like it's Nardo
Women, if you love me, please let me know
Tie rags 'round your neck and learn the sets we throw
These are the days of our lives and I'm sorry to the fans
But them crackers weren't playin' fair at Jive

But you ain't hangin' out the window when you in that G2
Or that G3 or G4 like we dos

Wanna know the time? Better clock us
Niggas bite the style from the shoes to the watches
We cloud hoppers, tailored suits like we mobsters
Break down keys into dimes and sell 'em like Gobstoppers
Who gon' stop us? Not a goddamn one of you
Mean with the re-up, nigga, we street tumblers
Ivory white, yeah that's the same color
Of a 'Zure, nigga, best believe it's the Mulliner
Take no prisoners, rap niggas are whisperers
Choke on your own spit just as soon as you mention us
Champagne corks is kicked by Louis sports and
Keep my hoes in Pucc' and Charles Jourdan, uh
Cop it, chrome it, touchscreen component
Mink on the floor, make you hot, don't it?

Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning, I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Nah, love, that's forbidden"
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust, I know them twenties real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls, from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you twos was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make (Get down)

Smoke something, drink something, get ripped

From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down)

Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free, "Ay, they with me"
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time her song on
I like that, ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but nah, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras (Get down)

Please do not be alarmed (Get, get down)
It will not hurt you at all
For it is the real
For all my real niggas and bitches (Get, get)

When they say, "Last call", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, "No sir"
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it, the whip appeal or my baby face?
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-twos gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man (Get down)
