Cut cover take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight

And oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me go

Don't you remember how I used to like
Being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the pricе?
You might also like
Cut cover take that test
Hold couragе to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you
Don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight

And oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go

I had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh, let's fight 

And oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me go
Let go, let go, let go of everything Embed
