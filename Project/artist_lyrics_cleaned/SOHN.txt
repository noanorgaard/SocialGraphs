We weave in and out of consciousness alone
’Til our bodies collide and keep
Us from getting cold
Skin pores open up and swallow each
Other whole
And the scars we collect connect
And reverse the flow
And so it goes
And so it goes

Emotions, emotions, motion us to wars
And our last experiences serve as swords
Each life that we take bores holes
Into the walls
’Til the roof caves in and we wash up on
The shore
And so it goes
And so it goes
And so it goes
And so it goes

But there's a light
If you dare to believe it
That floods in and washes all away
Blood sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it
The light
If you dare to believe it
That floods in and washes all away
Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it
Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive it
Blood, sweat and tears won't retrieve it
You just have to wait to receive 

I can feel it coming over the hillside
It's a valley fire and it's coming to burn us down
Like a rushing comet bound for the planet
And we're dinosaurs living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
We can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel...

As the ice is melting, merging with ocean
All our eyes are open and we're looking out to sea
And I'm hibernating, shut down and waiting
For another summer living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it, feel it
We can never go back
I can feel...

I can feel it coming, coming back to haunt me
It's a glass that's empty and we're trying to fill it up
We're lost civilians with the weight of millions
We're pawns in war living in denial

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel...
We can never, we can never go back
We can never, we can never go back
We can never, we can never go back

I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel it coming, we can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel it coming
We can never go back
Never go back, never go back
I can feel, I can feel
