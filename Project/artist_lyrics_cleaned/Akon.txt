Swagging, I'm bragging, we pulling them hoes
Loving the way you touching your toes
Killing the vibes, rocking the flows
Hitting the gas and we ready to go
We drinking Alize
You know it don't phase me
That I be up all night feeling this party (aye)
Drink lean, feeling mean
Ready to be seen
On a gangsta lean
We're a one man team
I'm like an army, feel my tsunami
Poseidon's sipping top shelf surfing his Ferrari
You can't harm me, don't try to arm me
Girls around the country trying to alarm me
We in it hearty, seen looking classy
Only thing we do making good girls turn naughty
Ah, you see me looking fresher
Turn up the bass hit up C4 Selector
How bizarre, were looking pretty royal
Fresh oh Lorde, you know them hoes ain't loyal!

I step into the club just to watch your body work
Pull yo ass up and we watch that booty twerk
Baby get low like you grind on me
Pull your ass up maybe set you free
Run and tell your friends that you're leaving with me
Shawty, you a ten and the best I can see
I know it's one night and baby I'm sorry
But let's have fun, blame it all on me

Shake your tail feathers, talk shop, I'mma bag you
Hell yeah, feel like the Prince Of Bel-Air
You booty me, throw your shit in the air, and I'mma take you home
No lie, I'm home alone, Macaualy gone
Coulda woulda shoulda's what them other girls are thinking on
Party so hard, you'd think it was a felony..
I'm gon' say it.. Yeah I'm rocking "Felony"!
(Bad) Badder then the rester
Haters too loud, you need a suppressor
Bottle after bottle, yeah boy we get light
Club full of models, gonna be a good night
Okay, goodnight, sweet dreams, sleep tight
Sleeping on G-Dub oh you better get right
Have my boy Richie
Yeah, we gonna kill them
Let them girls know why they're moving to the rhythm like!


Yeah you know I'm back, and this ain't no heart attack
I be stepping in the club, bringing all the ladies back
Girl, you don't gotta like it
But you might as well respect that fact that I'm just reppin' my scene
Till we get it bring the beat back
Crazy, hazy never phase me
All these dudes like Patrick Shwayze
Kinda shady, looking lazy
I'm the one to get your lady
Elevating, devastating
You be there just hesitating
Meditating, more than waiting
I'm just saying far from hating
What you doing? What you drinking?
Club is closing. Stop the thinking
Take my hand, lets hit the floor
Show me that you like it raw
Yeah we dance, dance all night
Never stop till it's light
Till it's light? Till it's light!?
Damn, this girl is out of sight!
Check the time, my oh my
Time to go, kiss goodbye
Till next time, bye bye bye
Gotta go, gotta fly
Round the crew, yeah we back
Time to go, time to gap
See that girl? Who is she?
Sorry, blame it on me

I know we just met
I know we just started
But there's something here
I can tell we got it
We like a classic song
I been singing all night long
And it goes like

Oh my love
My darling
When we sober up
Will you still be mine?

When the party's over
And the lights cool down
When everybody go
I'm hoping that you stick around
When the high is over

I'm hoping that you stick around, stick around

Couple years ago I'm up in AC
I get a call from Clark Kent and he don't ever call me
Talkin’ ‘bout he heard your version of my song
He told you, you was bitin’ and you knew that you was wrong
But not for nothing you was tryin to make it better
And trying to reach out to see if we can do it together
I’m like, “Clark, nigga you must be faded
Why the fuck would I collab on some shit that I created? Y’all jaded
If you don't get the fuck off my phone
And tell that old faced-ass nigga to leave me alone
Get gone. Clark, you know I ain’t that dude
And yeah I fell back on rap but don't get it confused.”
Shit lit my fuse, you wouldn't call Hov
And say 21 Savage want to do "22 Two’s"
Nigga, would you? The fuck wrong with y’all?
Bitin’ niggas, I could never get along with y’all
A song? Naw, straight curvin’ niggas
I wouldn’t even take a picture with Uncle Murda, nigga
And then you started makin’ ‘em takin’ your little shots
But I ain’t never hear ‘em, they only play ‘em up top
You not worthy, you’re just dirty and thirsty
You make them every year, they never get past Jersey
Nigga stop it, you got Brooklyn lookin’ crazy
Matter-fact, you got Brooklyn lookin’ lazy
I got cases in Virginia, bodies in D.C
You got to think B.I.G. if you wanna come for me
And I’m still VA, and I’m still that nigga
Still M-A-D, where your skills at nigga?
I heard you got popped and you ain’t peel that nigga
Whoever told you to change your name, you should kill that nigga
Lenny Grant, I can’t leave that alone
That shit read like it on the side of a funeral home
Ladies and gents, this nigga gettin’ washed and rinsed
Now if you a junior then that name makes sense
Respect to your dad, that’s the least I can do
Actually, umm, naw, fuck him too
Now how a Stan going to come for the man?
Don't hide your hand, you wanted to be a wrap-up fan
I ain’t Tweetin’, I ain’t needin’ the ‘Gram
I’m Pusha T-ing, remindin’ these niggas who the fuck I am, damn
Reminding you on who the fuck you are
You a comedian, we don't come to you for bars
We straight, on top of that you fake
Nigga, you signed to G-Unit ten years too late
And what I’m ‘bout to say might piss New York off
But you one of the reasons that New York soft
A worker who could never be a New York boss
Smack that dirty fitted off your head, New York lost
Nigga, dead-ass son, I’m not the one
I heard back in your past you used to bust your gun
I give a fuck, nigga, I don't care
Have a seat, here’s a chair, no love over here
Yeah, this the future
Now who the fuck get shot and make a tape called respect the shooter, huh
You a adlibber but that’s all you do
I can name 20 Brooklyn rappers more relevant than you
So stop fuckin’ with us, I go with Kane, B.I.G. and Jay, but that’s obvious
Buckshot, Tek and Steele, Rock and Ruck
Mos Def, Kweli, Masta Ace, Fabolous
Foxy, umm, Lil Kim and Cease
Skyzoo, Torae, oh Joell Ortiz
I’m a Joey BADA$$, ask AZ
M.O.P. would have told you you shouldn’t fuck with me
You sendin’ DMs like a thirty chick
And got mad when I asked your dirty-ass, “Who this?”
And you can guntalk all day, that’s yours
But you ain’t seein’ me with these goddamn bars
You’ll never say you took me
Before that happens, Young M.A. will give you some pussy
Nigga, you kept pushin’ so I had to play
But this type of shit happens everyday
And when you see me, you know what I’ma say
I was spreadin' love, it’s the Virginia way, niggaYou might also
