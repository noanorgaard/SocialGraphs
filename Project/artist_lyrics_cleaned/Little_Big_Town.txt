I wish it wasn't 4 a.m., standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

I hold on to this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Could've been the one, if you were a better man

You're going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit
I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break

Yeah, I'm going to lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl, try another night
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5

Hey, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found, oh, yeah

The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado... and I'm coming after you...

Oooo...
Hmm...

And I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
And I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and it sounds familiar

I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

I can taste that honeysuckle and it's still so sweet
When it grows wild on the banks down at Old Camp Creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'

And havin' a little was just enough

You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am


Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road
And that's home to me, feels like home to me

Should we water ski or just floating along?
What color are those labels supposed to turn to… Read More 
Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go
Who said anything about skiing?
Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

On the pontoon
Making waves and catching rays up on the roof
Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmmm motorboating

(Hoo hoo hoo)

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube

Because I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high, leaning on your shoulder
Sweeter like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't want to go sober
Oh, when I die, I don't want to go sober

You're like drinking from a never-ending bottle
When I think it's gone there's always a little more left
Lay back with you and close my eyes
Let the big old world just spin on by
And saying your name with my last breath

I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then, you'd want me just as much

I don't get no sleep, I don't get no peace
