(Oh)
(Here we go, yo)
Yesterday is history (oh)
You gotta get through it
Tomorrow is a mystery, so
Let's just do it
And even when the rain falls
You and I will stand tall
No matter what you go through
I'll never leave you

So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of the song (song)
Together is where we belong ('long)
Never stop dreaming
Keep holding on
You might also like
At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don't
So, I'm glad that I'm here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying "you're not alone"
Singing la la la la
Que sera

When it's been a long day
Had enough, given up, it ain't okay
We don't care what the world say
We spread love, it's the only way

So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of the song (song)
Together is where we belong ('long)
Never stop dreaming
Keep holding on

At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don't
So, I'm glad that I'm here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying "you're not alone"
Singing la la la la
Que sera
We keep falling, but the
World keeps spinning, and I
Might stop winning, just as
Long as I got you by my side
We keep falling, but the
World keeps spinning, and I
Might stop winning, but I
Know that we're gonna be alright

At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don't
So, I'm glad that I'm here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying "you're not alone"
Singing la la la la
