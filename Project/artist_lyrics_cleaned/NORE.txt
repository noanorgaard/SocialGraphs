Homeboy, I came to party (Ohh!)
Your girl was looking at me (Ohh!)
She's a haggler, naw, I'm not tagging her (Ohh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start asking ya (Ohh!)
"What you wanna do, nigga?" (Nothin')
"What you tryna do, nigga?" (Nothin')
"What you wanna do, nigga?" (Nothin')
"What you tryna do?" (Nothin')

Yo, yo, yo... yo, N-O-R papi, say what? That nigga's the man
With his manager Chris and the label that Jams
Still flossing, showing your rocks
Ain't you dudes heard "Grimey," man? We stoled your watch
It goes Indian style, knees bent in dashiki
Strapped with the baby TEC, baby TEC, BT
True, she at the bar, looking good in the brown dress
Ordered six shots, and them things ain't around yet
Persona all thugged out, loud and clear
Saying fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer
You see I'm replying now and my mami's I got a weapon now
Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high stepping now
Left that wack label 'cause I don't like pricks
I'm like a hammer that you hold in your hand, I make hits
At the white boy club while I'm buyin' the bar
They like, "Hey now, you're an all star!" – it go

I spit MAC millimeter rhymes, kill a liter in line
My nigga Peter got a heater of mines
Niggas still lying in they wack ass bars
Only time they seen jail, when they watchin 'Oz'
I'm in the club pissy drunk like, "Ahhhdadidaaaaa!!!!!!"
And mami took it proper like, "Dadadidaaaaa!!!!!!"
Adios, kill your soul, then we body your ghost
They call me Gordo, I sip the champagne that's importo
Playing "Capicu" (Man, you ain't nappy too!!!)
I like when chocha be nappy too
I treat life like a fast car, lower my speed
I try and chill, and sell more records than Creed
Been a hustler, (What? What?) way before 'Melvin Flynt'
A criminal, don't leave no prints
These dudes gave me a brick and they ain't seen me since
Caught up wit 'em, had them dudes straight hopping the fence, it go

Yo, yo, yo... yo, oops, I done done it again, I got another one
I keep it hid in my pocket, I got another one
'Fast and Furious,' dunn dunn dunn tudunn
Still be in–Miami and jet skiing
In the ocean, where the sharks be at, just O.D.'n
Adebisi, want a brick? You pay double, easy
I got them things that'll move easy
And I told the lawyer, I sold blow to old Goya
I'm half-Spanish, you see I cook coke for Goya
I'm half-Spanish, all day arroz con polla
Recognize, when I'm runnin' the game
Before me – chickens wasn't even messin' with brain
Because me – now you started gettin' head on the westside highway
So recognize, my nigga, you did it my way
Ice rockin', brick chopping, and gun shoppin'
I did it all, beat cases without Cochran
