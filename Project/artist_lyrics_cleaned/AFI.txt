(Will swallow whole) Just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) Has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased

What follows will swallow whole
What follows will swallow

Let's love and kill like 17 now
Let's love, like 17
I'm in love with your new screams
Only bring those pretty, frightful things to me
Let's love and kill like 17 now
Let’s run, and kill like 17 now
Let’s love, and kill like
