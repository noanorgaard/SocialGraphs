Over and over again
I hear Your voice in my head
Let Your light shine, let Your light shine
For all to see

Start a fire in my soul
Fan the flame and make it grow
So there's no doubt or denying
Let it burn so brightly
That everyone around can see
That it's You, that it's You that we need
Start a fire in me

You only need a spark to start a whole blaze
It only takes a little faith
Let it start right here in this city
So these old walls will never be the same
You might also like
Over and over again
I hear Your voice in my head
They need to know, I need to go
Spirit won't You fall on my heart now

Start a fire in my soul
Fan the flame and make it grow
So there's no doubt or denying
Let it burn so brightly
That everyone around can see
That it's You, that it's You that we need
Start a fire in me

You are the fire, You are the flame
You are the light on the darkest day
We have the hope, we bear Your name
We carry the news that You have come to save
Only You can save

Start a fire in my soul
Fan the flame and make it grow
So there's no doubt or denying
Let it burn so brightly
That everyone around can see
That it's You, that it's You that we need
Start a fire in me
You are the fire, You are the flame
You are the light on the darkest day
Start a fire in
