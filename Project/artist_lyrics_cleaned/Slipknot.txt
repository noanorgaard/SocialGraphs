I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone, I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
If I can change, I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not care
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh, my love was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me 

Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven

You and I can't decide
Which of us was taken for granted
Make amends
Some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother
You might also like
You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil

I'm not your Devil anymore
Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, depravation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So, step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore
So, step inside
Step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I,
