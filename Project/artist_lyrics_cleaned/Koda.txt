Yo, what's good? This is kid JID, and I'm here at the 2017 Hip Hop Awards Cypher with the homies, Kodie Shane, Cozz and Ali Tomineek. Yo, DJ Premier drop that, bruh

Look, I'm tired of ****** rolling around like they've been holding it down
When I been picking it up, you must be joking around
For months I ain't spoke a sound, but I'm back in the mac, been crafting that crack
That'll have 'em gasping and asking if they can have it, nah
Just tryna do better and switch up a few letters
You know, from EBT to BET
I be E.T., ain't expect to see me speak
Right in front your TV screen, I'm cold, at
Twenty-years-old made Cozz & Effect and got respect and now watch when I drop Effected
You probably gon' drop a pendant, that's off the chain
I paid my dues 
Got a lot to lose and a lot to gain and that's not gon' change
No regrets as I write these songs
Just continue to spit fire as my life drag on
You barely would last a round, better kill that quick
You scary ****** is clowns and you still ain't It, gone

They say money don't make the man but, damn, I'm makin' money
Spent bands on Rick Owens, I'm laughing at my opponents
Put a big wheel out and I bet that she hoppin' on it
I know they want me to fail and they gon' keep waiting on it
Put the faucet on my neck and let it rinse, I'm balling, ain't no defence
You ****** play on the bench, lookin' at me while I switch
Gears, I am so unfazed and, baby
I don't have no fear, uh, please don't touch my  and baby
Please don't touch my hair, I think them girls with me so let 'em in, I don't care
I know that they really not my friends, I'm aware
Somebody peekin' through the window, we ain't scared
We ain't scared, hahaha

Yo, ayy, check
I ain't sorry for the way I came into this ring
Enter the Dragon, Bruce Lee how I'm kicking this thing
Check the name, it's Ali, never miss when I swing
Anything that I spit'll , stick with the 
I shook a beat, I'm from the stars like a Wookie be
Now they asked for the booking fee, I'm very amazed
Yo, what's happening? Look and see, my area changed
I guess I'm Kaepernick, took a knee and married the game
That's why BET callin', they aware I'm 
Be very afraid, my thoughts kinda get carried away
I swear that my brain's wearing a cape, preparing for Sway
It's operation domination 'til I'm buried away
My barriers break, can't be confined, I ain't gonna lie
They get declined, overstepping over statements of mine
Maxine with the way that I rhyme, I'm reclaiming my time
If my cypher was longer you would say I'm the greatest alive, ah
Yeah

Um, look
Scribble the ritual, show me a sicker individual
'Cause time critical, sensitive, rigorous training
Venomous fangs, my teeth clench, I envision a pain
You feel is insane but I been the same
I've been away for many days, channellin' my behaviour
Hasta lue-go back to Africa they say
Pack a bag but ****** grab a Gat for the melee
 to the races like Ricky Bobby or Tay-K
Your favorite rapper act like Sheneneh holding a chopper
I never sold work but my homie, he really got a
Few pills, lil' white girl in his sock
Never touch that boy like he Afrika Bam-
'Bout to out of here, scram, off of your property, land, BET
JID beastin'. you can't see 'em, I'm paramecium
Pardon me,  'cause I thought I seen 
They don't want beef, them boys vegan
Gimme the ring, them boys teethin'
Better put your hands up to the ceiling 'fore them people start squeezin' and find alliances
 pistol  pledge allegiance, I do defiant shit
Eyeing your shit because I ain't shit, run your diamonds
If you resist then empty the clip, I'm like a scientist
A Black , that boy crazy
Jack old ladies, smack your babi—I ain't gon' do that
I'm just playin', we good, haha,
