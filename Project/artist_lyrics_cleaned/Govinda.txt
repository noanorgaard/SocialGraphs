Someday i will laugh aloud...
But for now i rise...
Higher and higher -
I know i can be
Twisted inside
Of being free, yeah
Higher and higher -
The small rising, yeah
Leaves the desire
To open...
By the way, a way to set it free
And all i have to do is to
Believe
Yeah (please believe me)
All i have to do...
This time
This time (lalalalala)
(are angels inside of my head)
This time...
(i have angels...)
Why not?
Tell me...
And all i have to do is to
Believe (live, live)
I know, i know i can be
And with the love there's in me...
By the way, a way to set it free
And all i have to do
Is to believe...
This time...
(shake it...)
Love, love
Lovelovelolololovelovelove...
(shake it...)
Rise...
(shake it...)
Love, love
Lovelovelolololovelovelove...
(shake it...)
I know... higher and higher...
Twisted inside, yeah...
