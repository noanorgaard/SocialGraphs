Some far off feeling, some up close kind of ache
A wide screen reason to look the other way

There's a place by the lake that you go when it's late
In the summer when the crowds are gone
And you sit all alone with your thoughts getting stoned
Just waiting for some peace to come
Like the thing that you tried that you thought that you liked
For a minute then it all felt wrong
So you change it again, all your clothes, all your friends
It's the same as it ever was
You might also like
That far off feeling, that up close kind of ache
Some wide screen reason to look the other way

It's the road that you paved over Indian graves
And you wonder why your dreams are crazed
So you cling to your wife, your kids, your life
There's nothing that you're gonna save
Put the razor to your face, hot water for a shave
Kill the shadow of yesterday
Clean shirt, clean pants, clean slate, second chance
You're going by another name

Some far off feeling, an up-close kind of ache
That instant karma always comes too
