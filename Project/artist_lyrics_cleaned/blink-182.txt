Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Surprises let me know she cares

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, miss you
I miss you, I miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back
And it'll happen once again, you'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan

Outside, the carolers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
From the roof are hanging sicles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again

So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must have snapped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter

It's Christmastime again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
'Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
'Cause a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package (Hot damn!)

I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in
And there I stayed

Lay beside me and listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying until the summer comes

I had that dream about you again
Where you drive my car right off a fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Let me kiss you one last time, goodnight

He pauses shaving, and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds

He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out every day, she goes every way
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy, often, they've typically
Been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more (She's open, waiting for more)

Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
