In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

All the birds sing words

And the flowers croon

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

Welcome to our tropical hide-a-way
You lucky people you
If we weren't in the show starting right away
We'd be in the audience too

Altogether
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
You might also like
All the birds sing words

And the flowers croon

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

I sing so beautiful! I should sing solo

(spoken)
Si, solo we can't hear you

My voice may not be so marvelous but my profile is out of this world

(spoken)
Jawohl, but the trouble is it's not far enough out of this world. Isn't that right, herr Schmidt? Oh ho, I see Schmidt has no hair!

(spoken)
Mi amigos, stop the clucking. You sound like a bunch of old hens. There's a lot of birds waiting to go on. For instance-
The boys in me back are called macaws

Because of their claws?

No, because they're macaws
And my fine feathered friend is a jolly toucan
And two can sound better than one toucan can

The bird of paradise is an elegant bird
It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard
Most little birdies will fly away
But the tiki room birds are here every day

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

All the birds sing words

And the flowers croon
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

Our show be delightful. We hope you'll agree
We hope that it fills you with pleasure and glee
Because if we don't make you feel like that
We're gonna wind up on a lady's hat

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

All the birds sing words

And the flowers croon

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room

My magnificent produc-ti-on is yet to come
So strum the guitar and beat the drum
We've been a hit and we know you'll adore us
So come on and join us in another chorus

In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room 
*sings softer*
All the birds sing words and the flowers croon
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room 
*sings back to normal volume*
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki room
All the birds sing words and the flowers croon
In the tiki tiki tiki tiki
