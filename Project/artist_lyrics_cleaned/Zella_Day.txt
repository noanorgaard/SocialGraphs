Coming for you now

Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)

Be my man and show me what it feels like
Denim sky unbuttoned down the middle
Spillin' out little by little

Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)

If I wanted to stay, you don't mind
You're a true believer (True believer)

You're a true believer (True believer)
Take it up with the badlands
Creep on in like a concrete fever

Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
Keep me from the cages under the control
Runnin' in the dark to find east of Eden
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
To find east of Eden (Oh)
