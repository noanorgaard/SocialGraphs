I hope you find a way to be yourself someday
In weakness or in strength
Change can be amazing
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you

I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me, with me
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me, with me

Chasing, always chasing dreams
Why’d you stick around, why’d you stay with me?
Why’d you fake it?
Hesitation is killing me too
But I couldn’t save it, I couldn’t save it

I think I found hell
I think I found something
I think I found something in my TV screen
I think I found out
That I have nothing
That I have nothing in this place for me
I watched it all in my head, perfect sense
They'll take me from my bed
Leave everything that is worth a single cent
And just take me instead
That TV show I saw as I fell asleep
Had me on both my knees
Praying to whatever is in heaven, please send me a felon
And don't let the police know

Anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please
Anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please, oh

I think I can tell
I think I can tell them
Tell them they were made for me
I'm thinking they'll know, know it already
I'm thinking they'll know just about everything
I bet they planned it all out like the shows
Went everywhere I go
Walked in the store right behind me
Stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home
I'm sure they figured it out, early on
That I would never run
That they could shoot but that's no fun
'Cause then they're killing the stolen son

If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled

Light at the beginning of the tunnel

When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming

Make that money, fake that dummy, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

Sell your soul, not your whole self

I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me (In front of me)

R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth, yeah
You can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop
I was naive and hopeful and lost
Now I'm aware and trapped in my thoughts, woah

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)

And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst times (Ah)
