In this time, I've lost all sense of pride
I've called a hundred times
If I hear your voice, I'll be fine

And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
'Cause I can't help but wonder
What if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep
These four walls and me

I lay in bed, can't seem to leave your side
The pillow's wet from all these tears I've cried
I won't say goodbye
I tried to smile today
Then I realised there's no point, anyway
