You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

You lay me down and left me for the lions
A long, long time ago
You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard
Will stay on your mind
It ain't gonna let you go, no
'Cos you were the moon
And I the endless sky

You'll always know the reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
Ain't gonna let you go

You had the keys to the car
You had every star
Every one of them twinkling
Baby what were you thinking
We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my 

Bad misses, throwing raspberry kisses on me
You looking for direction, girl, I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweat'n, we ain't supposed to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, girl, I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you're taken and tossed
And when I'm breaking it off, there's no denying the fact, it's wrong
'Cause you got a man who's pro'lly playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you gone
Is it 'cause he's superficial?
Or is he too submissive?
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic?
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he 'bout is paper, never took the time with you to listen?
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone
Of course
Dealing with this, you won't be takin' a loss
You need to leave him alone, and roll with the one who's breaking you off

Keep each other thirsty, kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed, 'cause we don't need the controversy

You probably told your man it was Jamila's birthday
Meanwhile, we champagne, chilling the ice
