A couple inches and a few years back
I met this girl who had this wicked thing I lack man
Nobody knew that we were sneakin’ around
Finding funny spots where me and she could get down but
Just when I thought my mary jane could get no better
I stumbled upon this smokey baby in her sweater
And when I met her
I prayed for better weather
So I could see what’s hiding underneath her sweater

I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ come through
I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ what I’m feelin’ what I’m feelin’ come

I said good golly miss molly what kind of shampoo do you use
You got me feelin’ finer than a wicked inmate on the loose
And if you loosen up my noose
I’ll come through and kick you buku rhymes
Supersonic syllables on how you got me hypnotized
Flip the script and then go dip into this bed of mine
Scatter the petals of every rose that I could go and find
I’m tryin to blow your mind
I’m tryin to live on the tip of your tongue and sip on every breath out of your lungs
And if I, had me the money well I’d go buy you an island
‘Cause these eyes have been spyin’ a treasure better than diamonds
(There ain’t no lyin’)
I tell nothin’ but truth inside the booth
And if you give me just one minute well I bet I’ll give you proof
(And she got)
Kisses sweeter than the strawberry seeds
That she be plantin’ on my neck hopin’ to grow in a week
And every autumn they blossom into an awesome homage
To the greatest of romances tell the peeps to applaud

I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ come through
I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ come through
Use my body
Take my soul
Have my brain if you want control
Seems I’m crazy
Lost a screw
Yup I’m mad about you
Lock me up in a padded cell
Kiss my neck like you do so well
I’ll go out of my mind I’ll go mad without you

I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ come through
I like me
I like you
I like the possibility of us two
I think we could be cool
So if you’re feelin’ what I’m feelin’ what I’m feelin’ what I’m feelin’
