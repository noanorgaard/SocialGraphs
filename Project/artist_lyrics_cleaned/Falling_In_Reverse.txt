My body's trembling, sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive (Drive)
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying: "Feet, don't fail me now"

I've lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

(I got these questions always running through my head)
(So many things that I would like to understand)
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?

I've lost myself
You tried to reach me, but you just can't help me
So long, goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time 'cause now

I've lost my fucking mind, and there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?
Oh, can't you see?
Can't you 

And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters

I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope

Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up

Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie)
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

God bless all of you now
'Cause I'm going straight to Hell
And I'm taking you down with me
'Cause you know damn well
