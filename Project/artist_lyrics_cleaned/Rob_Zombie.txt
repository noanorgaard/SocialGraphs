Dead I am the one
Exterminatin' son
Slippin' through the trees
Stranglin' the breeze

Dead I am the sky
Watchin' angels cry
While they slowly turn
Conquering the worm

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Dead I am the pool
Spreading from the fool
Weak and want you need
Nowhere as you bleed

Dead I am the rat
Feast upon the cat
Tender is the fur

Knuckle, crack the bone
Twenty-one to win

Dead I am the dog

Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Stir the limbs across the wrist
Full possession of a memory
Bury me as a dog
Oh, icy hands surrounding me

The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees
The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
Down in the cool air I can see
You might also like
Hey, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted
Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Shriek the lips across ragged tongue
Convulsing two together, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud
Bound up the dead triumphantly

The ragged they come and the ragged they kill
You pray so hard on bloody knees

Hey, yeah, I'm your superbeast

Hey, yeah, I'm your
