Come on, everybody
I say, now, let's play a game
I betcha I could make a rhyme
Out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name
I treat it like it wasn't there
But a "B" or an "F"
Or an "M" will appear
You might also like
And then I say "bo", add a "B", then I say the name
Then "bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"
And then I say that name again with an "F", very plain
Then a "fee fi" and a "mo"
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme

Arnold
Arnold, Arnold, bo-barnold
Bo-na-na fanna fo-farnold
Fee fi mo-marnold
Arnold

But if the first two letters are ever the same
I drop them both, then say the name
Like Bob, Bob, drop the B's for Ob
Or Fred, Fred, drop the F's for Red
Or Mary, Mary, drop the M's for Ary
That's the only rule that is contrary

Okay, now say "bo" (Bo)
Now Tony with a "B" (Bony)
Then bo-na-na fanna and fo (Bo-na-na fanna fo)
Then you say the name again with an "F" very plain (Fony)
Then a fee fi and a mo (Fee fi mo)
Then you say the name again with an "M" this time (Mony)
And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme
Everybody do Tony
Tony, Tony, bo-bony
Bo-na-na fanna fofony
Fee fi mo-mony
Tony
