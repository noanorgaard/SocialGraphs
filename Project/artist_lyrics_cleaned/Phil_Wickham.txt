Who breaks the power, of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory
The King above all kings
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless, in awe and wonder?
The King of Glory
The King above all kings

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight


Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more

Through the years, we all will be together
If the Lord allows
Hang that shining star on the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas nowSee Phil Wickham LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also

1 ContributorThe First Noel Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

"The first Noel", the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
And in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel


And they looked up and saw a Star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued, both day and night

Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Oh, let angels adore Him, all bow before Him

Come, they told me, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
A newborn King to see, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And to lay before the King, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum

So to honor Him, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
When we come (Rum, pa-rum)

Little Baby, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And I am a poor boy, too, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And I have no gift to bring, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And that's fit to give the King
Pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
Rum, pum-pum, pum, rum, pum-pum, pum

Shall I play for Him? Pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
On my drum!
