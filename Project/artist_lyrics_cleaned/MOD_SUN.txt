I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Shoot 'em down like bang, bang, bang
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign (MOD SUN)
Shoot 'em down (Yeah)

Still that H-I double P-Y, you could probably see why
Out the seventies, heavenly, sorta divine
When I put the letters together, the stars realign
And I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Living like a rockstar, hair like pasta
Wanna talk style? Okay, I already lost ya
Duke Ellington in the Uber ride
Ridin' by my old high school
Now I school the high
Deeper than a scuba dive
Who am I?

I don't even gotta say it
You're talkin' 'bout the greatest, and I am affiliated
Debated that I could be the most underestimated
And imitated entertainer, and I came from the basement
Inspiration, medication
That is all I needed in my life's equation
Only two things that I will not do
Watch my back and watch my language
Fuckwit
You might also like
Well, I just believe that action define you
So let me remind you
The time to hesitate is already behind you
So I stay scratchin' off my bucket list
I'm in love with this
So unconditish, no competitish
And when it comes to this, there's no compass
I go my own way
Rebel to the relevant, mind of an elephant
Never forget

To stay high, that's right
Smoke me out in my death bed
Bury me with my pipe
'Cause I know y'all be chiefin' like me (La-da-da-da)
Y'all need it like me
Pay the price for my high because
The price for freedom ain't free (Oh)
So keep dreaming

I shoot 'em down (Hahaha, yeah, Kells)
I shoot 'em down (Bang)
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign, yeah (What up, Ma?)
I shoot 'em down (I'm out here)
I shoot 'em (We still on that trip too)
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Shoot 'em down like bang, bang, bang
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Shoot 'em down like bang, bang, bang

I wi— I-wi— I will not—
I will not drown in the rising tide of conformity
I will not play the minor keys like the majority
I will not let authority ignore me
I'm moving forward for the ones who march before me
All power to the flower, burning chocolate by the hour
Origami with the raw paper never twisted poorly
Order me, more of me, see me in your city
No fans, got friends, show respect with a zippy
Came through with a gypsy
Named MOD SUN, but she call me that
This that order me, more of me, see me in your city (La-da-da-da)
No fans, got friends show respect with a zippy (La-da-da-da)
Came through with a gypsy (Hahaha, I fuck with this song crazy)
Named MOD SUN, but she call me that hippy

I wish I could fuck every single girl
Seven billion mini-mes runnin' 'round the world
This is for the teachers who said it wouldn't last
Shove that lesson plan up in your motherfuckin' ass
But it's all love over here
Nothing but green buds over here
Something about this time of year
Make my mushrooms go down like beer (Beer)
Can you hear me clear? Everybody chill
Please put up a peace sign
If you smoke a piece of mine and find a piece of mind
Yeah, oh (Hahaha, oh shit)
I shoot 'em down
I shoot 'em down (Yeah)
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign, yeah
I shoot 'em down (Still trippin')
I shoot 'em (Haha)

I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Shoot 'em down like bang, bang, bang
I shoot 'em down with a peace sign
Shoot 'em
