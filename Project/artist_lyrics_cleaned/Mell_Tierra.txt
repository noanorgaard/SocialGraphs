Oh yeah
Flawless  on all social media platforms
Gratitude album drops July 12th on The Radar, let's get it

It's the longevity
Mr. Do-It-Incredibly
Never lost his identity
Yo, I'm buildin' a legacy
God has really been blessin' me
Everyone gotta check for me
Hard pill to swallow, especially for my ecstasy
You heard wrong
Thinkin' just 'cause I switched up the recipe
That killin' 'em ain't been in the arsenal wit' my specialties
I been strong
Still behead anybody ahead o' me
Plus, I keep a TEC  in handy just like a referee
Legally
Don't want no problems if there don't need to be
I'd rather keep a Jesus piece and pray for you repeatedly
I'm easily… one o' da illest you heard o' recently
Ain't stoppin' till my pockets reach obesity
I've been here since the mixtapes
Do this for my kid's sake
Makin' sure they never have a missed plate
Should've been done at this rate
These rappers in my city still look at me with a pissed face
'Cause you could be the man, just not in this state
I ain't the one to chick-chase
Saw this girl that hit me on the 'gram before
Tellin' me it's wet enough for me to do a cannonball
I see you twerk, but what you standin' for?
She actin' petty but still got problems, she need the man to cure 
I'm fire and I'm back for
Whoever need a crash course
Quit doin' all that talkin' with that glass jaw
They say they want the old Flaw back?
Huh
Be careful what you ask for
Don't get your girl dug in with this hacksaw
I really beat the odds
They ask me why I'm not a superstar
Maybe it's not in the cards
I gotta leave it to God
The game changed; they got it backward with every bar
'Cause you can't call it 'rap' if your music ain't up to 'par'
I'm in top gear
Top tier
This is how I got here
Standin' right in my spot clear
Only hate 'cause you're not here, huh
I went through hell so I'on got fear
I act like it don't kill, but
Now I want a mill' for every dropped tear
It's real talk, I never cared what the rest said
Told 'em to keep the fame, I'm just here to collect bread
I know I'm gettin' older; they been askin' what's next then
I have the will to write on my deathbed
