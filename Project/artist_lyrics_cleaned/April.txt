Lets dance beneath the Eiffel
Lets wake up in Paris
I’ll show you all the city lights
Reflecting by the waterside
Have wine beneath the stars
Take me to your room
Waking up in Paris
Who knows what we’ll do

I got my high heels red dress
It’s kind of skintight strapless
Not going to be alone
Be alone tonight, tonight
I’ve got my hair fixed lipstick
I’ve got the nerves in my fingertips
I’m gonna take a chance, take a chance with you
I’m gonna risk it all

And who knows
Maybe we’ll get real close
And who knows
Maybe our skin will touch
And who knows
Maybe our hands will meet
You’re such a mystery
You might also like
Lets dance beneath the Eiffel
Lets wake up in Paris
I’ll show you all the city lights
Reflecting by the waterside
Have wine beneath the stars
Take me to your room
Waking up in Paris
Who knows what we’ll do

You got your slick black, cufflinks
You tell me I’m so lovely
You take me by my hands, open doors
All night, all night
You use your charm and all your wit
And it’s written upon your lips
You’ve got my heart racing
Temperature rising
With every touch of yours

And who knows
Maybe we’ll get real close
And who knows
Maybe our skin will touch
And who knows
Maybe our hand will meet
You’re such a mystery
Lets dance beneath the Eiffel
Lets wake up in Paris
I’ll show you all the city lights
Reflecting by the waterside
Have wine beneath the stars
Take me to your room
Waking up in Paris
Who knows what we’ll
