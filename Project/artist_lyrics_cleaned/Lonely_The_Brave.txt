We got the bad blood coursing in
Over the rim
We go hands to the ceiling
We got the room come falling in
Into the swim
We go hands to the ceiling
Black hearts
Fuck ‘em

What if I said that this ain't the one
Thick black words of a bellowed tongue
What if I said the climb of the drum
Will tear down scenes when you ain't go nowhere to run
Hangnote

We got the eyes up to the brim
Out of the ring
We go hands to the ceiling
We got the first light clawing limb
Under the skin
We go hands to the ceiling
Black hearts
Fuck ‘em

What if I said the riders had come

Hangnote
You're leaning towers
You change
