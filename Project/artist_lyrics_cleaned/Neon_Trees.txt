Hey, baby, won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey, baby, what you got to say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time

I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back

Hey, honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash-talk make me itchin'
You might also like
Oh my, my, shit, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks too much

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

Never thought I'd live to see the day (Ah-ah)
When everybody's words got in the way, oh


Hey, sugar, show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey, sugar, what you gotta say?

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks back

It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
Everybody talks, everybody talks back, 

Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983

I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade
You're there sucking on your lollipop
Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playing cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
‘Cause I feel it

Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983

The year I was born
I won't be ignored
So get your feet on the floor
I'm the only one
Are you afraid?
I still make you move
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
