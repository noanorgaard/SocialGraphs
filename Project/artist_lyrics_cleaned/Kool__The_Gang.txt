I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we prayed
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

Oh, it's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, lady (Too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, lady (Too hot)
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love, oh, my love

Flyin' high, we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me

I remember not too long ago
I went to a theater
And I saw the Kool and the Gang show
I always wanted to fit into a band
To sing my songs
And then become a bad piano playing man
So here I am in this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess, I guess I'll stay
