I be choppin’ when they want it like an onion
Open up the bag and eat you like some Funyuns
They don’t want it with the Brainsick, ain’t shit
They all run and hop when they be knowin’ I be comin’
Line ‘em up and they gon’ get the boot
Better that before I up and shoot
Bullets get to rainin’, follow with the hollow and you’re through
Someone should’a told ‘em from the get that I be sicker with the Brainin’
Kill ‘em when I fill ‘em the venom, I gotta be
Brazy, whatever the fuck done got into me
Made me a little bit loony, I really mean it
They tell me that I’m a genius, now will you suffer defeat?
Maybe! Kill ‘em all, Brainsick flow
Line up then get down on the floor
Duck when the Brainsick go
Hit ‘em with a 100 more volts
Usain Bolt couldn’t catch me when I zone, uh
Now I’m 'onna murder with a passion
Do you like a potato when I be mashin’
I burn ‘em up into ash and they be tellin’ me stop it
I gotta pop it, I mean I get massive
Bro go with bolos I get mo’
Get them and skippin’ the popo
Kill ‘em all and hide in the mo-mo
These motherfuckers is wolfin’ and really don’t know

Keep it right here on my hip (Why's that?)
I am Brainsick with no doctor (Damn!)
Everyone labeled me skitz (Skits)

On the ride, hangin’ out the side my whip, trip
People always talkin’ ‘bout what they gon’ come and do to me but it don’t mean shit

Roughin’ ‘em up with Ruffian Rugged
Cuttin' ‘em up like the mafia does it
Chop with the tongue and stomp on the sluggish
No mumble, it’s coffee, no cough syrup on it
Itt a golyószóró flow szószólója
Nem egy slow mo folyó szósz, so-so nóta
Beteg kórokozó kombó szorzója
Ez a no-go, nem a korzózó zóna!
Van ugye az a Maslow-piramis: az alap
Az a vitamin, a kaja, de nekem iram is az alatt
Így a tempó presto! Rímmasina szava
Mi ma hasít: könnyű „falat“… Sima liba zaba
Kell a szillabika-dara, bika dinamika tana!
Let‘s go, kilapítalak, a csiga-biga salak!
Lehetsz kópia-penge, de vágod, ez igazi katana!
Minden rímpár ipari paripa, RIP a ripacs alak!
Random a tag, otthon matat: automata lantom a tongue
Hadova, de a dobot ha betámadom, adom a tant
Hantavató hadam, mint a NATO-ban a katona, tank
Ha dobhatom, a duma “doom”, a “tomato”-m atom attak!
Ultimátum: ha témát a látogató latolgatja!
Flash, mint az Adobe, de ha fut, a progi: fagy oldala…
Csillagos ég  a vég, ha ég a rakéta-hajtóanyag
Akarom mondani, koffein a rangért a hatóanyag!
Jobbára üldözöm a balszerencsét
Becsap a becsavarodott agytekervény!
Auf Wiedersehen! De nem megy el a hangom
Mert gyorsabb a szám, mint a hangsebesség!
Ess szét, nyes a pen game, ez a pengém!
Max Payne, a te verzéd ide refrén!
Press play, kitör a vihar a fejemben, "choppa"-dék extrém!
Chemtrail: húzom a csíkot a fonématengerem mentén!
Kár bár, mire megy áriám, sikerem ábránd
S kálvária, mi vár rám ezen a pályán
Sztárgyár, igazi már-már soha nem áll rá
De táplál, ha iromány ékes, a piromán éghet a máglyán!
Lány pörög, ha csöpög a nyál, csömör, ám ökör a bárgyú!
Lám, lököm a lüke dumát, öröm, ha dörög az ágyúm
Tár kifogy-e? Minigun ász, örök, ha lövök! A száj
Ha be nem áll, török a falakon  át, hiába tömör a gát, BUMM!
Celebikonok a gyerekidolok
Kellenek emotikonok, ha vannak kerek idomok
Kinyír a szellemi nyomor, a “hóra gyere ki” dolog
És ugyan égeti magát a muki, de fekete befedi korom!
Én amúgy nem akarom játszani a zenei sznobot
A cél, hogy reakcióvideóra legyen is okod, ha fogod!
Dörög az ég? Ugyan, csak a belem, mi korog
De ne félj, soha nincs a terítéken mezei pocok!
Finom a fonéma, fenem a fogam, mily elemózsia
Kenem, ha nem is a kenyerem keresi, de melódia
Énem, a génem, a vénába égeti be genom, mi ha
Monomán ima, nem money-ra mondom, mi e meló díja!
Fenomén, így ha fonom a kódom, a fogó teketória!

Megannyi munka, de fakad a vakerom, móka, nem iga, de megöl a vak iram!
Ikonom égető fokon a miki, rím: megírom, magolom, ugatom makira!
Pakolom még ide meg oda, míg időm engedi, megadom okod a boogie-ra!
Függeni fog a nép, akár a mokira, baka, de béke nem akad e mukira!
Megunom ugyan a Pacot, a Biggie-t, ám akarom megint a ‘Pakinamac’-et
Ím, baki nem akad, ha megölöm őket, a mikin a bagatell fake elemeket!
Te fogod a fejed, a pokol a mogulom, aki nem okul, a bogara makula
Fakul a fekete? Mikor a figura bekeni, vaker a mikire pakura!

Ruffian mit dem uptempobeat für die massenhysterie
Liegt die waagschale tief zwischen hass oder liebe beim choppen auf beats
Hast du keine guten karten in dem spiel
Und glaub mir bitte die details werden pikant
Doppelte packerl im medizinschrank
Also gönne mir da bitte nur ein minimum an zeit und ich zünde den fucking benzintank
Bitte bitte bitte bars
Alle vernebelt im eigengeruch
Treiben im eigenen saft und im eigenen dunst
All die kindergarten modekinder wollen party aber kommen dann nur mit negativen energien und vibes in der luft
Gib mir bass
Ba- ba- ba- bass (ha?)
Jetzt kickt der baba paar bars (ja)
So viele von den bodybuildern geben den macker sind nur pickende dicke brocken wie die barbapapas
Yo, folgendermaßen
Alle deine mitarbeiter wollen mittlerweile mit der minimalen millimeter-gun an moneymoney
Geben aber dabei nur die bieder benebelte wiederbelebung der wiederbetätigung in negativem maß
Schau wie wir die kletteraffen kill'n
Während sie in hängematten chill'n
Bange machen gilt nicht –
Banger machen gilt!
(immer wieder ba!)

Dilang matatalas talagang tumataga ang kataga
Na tila parabang katana winasiwas
Sa kabilisan ay parang bala mga bara sapol
Kana bago palang babalaking makaiwas
Kolabo ng mga matutulin dalubhasa lalo
Pang lumalakas sa panahon na lumilipas
Sa buong mundo Sabotahe pangalan
Ng makatang kumatawan sa Pilipinas!
Handa ka ba sa mga buka ng mga labi na parang makina talaga na
Walang wag makatigil sa mga buga kapag sinimulan ko na makidada sa
Kalaban na talaga naman hindi na makalamang sa mga dalubhasa nakalikha
Ng mga bulalakaw na mga talata…
Sa matagal na panahon ay balikan na kung sino ba ko sa paraan na talaga
Naman na walang makaunawa sa kabilisan ng mga tula ko sinabi
Sakin na walang kabuluhan ang salita ko na walang maunawaan
Sa kabila ng mga lait dina napanghinaan napasakin na ang mga di makitaan
Pa ng iba na may tangan ng mga pinakatanging istilo ko
Dalubhasa na makata na may tangang titulo
Sa kabilisan ng mga tula talaga naman hindi na maabutan
Ng mga "nag apura, di na mauna, sa paran kona, di na mabura,"
Ginawa ko di na magawa ng mga sikat nyong idolo
Talaga naman sa paraan na ganito'y bagsak
Pinalaglag pinalagpak sa lapag
Nakapag nag mamataas
Lagabag, binalagbab binabalibag tinibag
Nakapag nag mamatigas
Pag pumalag pa't nag panggap matatag
Talagang nag mamalakas
Pagkat idinagdag, sa mga duwag na nabahag
Buntot di makapag angas
Sa Onion Choppa motherfucking Sabotahe
Ng Pilipinas!
