Lacking ambition, that's such a backwards mission
I know you a hater because you act suspicious
In a sea full of anger baby I'm captain vicious
Happiness isn't when your tax bracket is different
In need of god, but want money hoe, I'm sacrilegious
Hustle like none other
I have no trust, I hate when rappers call each other brother
They hate on niggas from afar
It's rap motherfuckers
I'm back, don't slack niggas
Art flow, Picasso, I'm in darth mode
So much drive, this is that push to start flow
Young Pablo, criminal since a snot nose
Now it's love come down
I'm riding drop rolls
It all came from the dopest top notch flows
Vintage heavy clothes
It's like these niggas got issues with shit they never show
What I say is law
The scraps they gave me made a nigga want it all, applaud
I want a house in the hills, a pool in the back
Maybe a Benz or a Cadillac
A chain and a grill
A whole lotta stacks
You can't say that I lack ambition, ambition
There's something cooking in the kitchen
Straight tunnel vision
So come on tell me what you're missing

Sippin from a potion like it's of holy water
I saw the stars align in the right order
You used to tell me I was dreaming
Wish you could feel just what I'm feeling now
But what can I say, you're not on my level, you're not on the wave

I want a house in the hills, a pool in the back
Maybe a Benz or a Cadillac
A chain and a grill
A whole lotta stacks
You can't say that I lack ambition, ambition
There's something cooking in the kitchen
Straight tunnel vision
So come on tell me what you're
