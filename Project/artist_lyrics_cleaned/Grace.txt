But I'm Gerald (Yeah)
And I can always have just what I want (Want)
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shoppin', you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope (Nope), she ain't with it, though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
You might also like
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down, 'cause I'd never stay

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

Re-re-real-re-real-re-really though (Though), honestly
I get bored of basic— (No)
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, textin' her
And askin' her if she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures
She said no (What?), well, goddamn (Damn)
She said come over and see it for yourself
Never askin' for your help
Independent woman, she ain't for the shelf
Nah (Nah), she's the one
Smoke with her until the— (Ah)
Stayin' up until we see the sun
The baddest ever, swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done (Yeah)
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever, ever, ever gonna be owned
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please (Ha, hey)

You don't own me
Oh, no, okay, oh, no, no
You don't own me
Oh, no, no, no, you don't, you don't, hey
You don't own me
But just know, you never met somebody like me before, though
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
You don't own me
Nah, nah, Eazy
You don't own
