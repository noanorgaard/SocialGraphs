Tonight is the night
We dance in the lights
Won't stop 'til the sun comes out

When we collide
Babe, it's just you and me
This is love, living in a fantasy
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no, no
When we collide
Babe, it's just you and me

You are the piece that I can't replace
A star shot from outer space
And as the lights dance around your face
Not gonna stop 'til the break of day
You might also like
Tonight is the night
We dance in the lights
Won't stop 'til the sun comes out
It's just you and I, we're sparks in the night
Won't stop 'til we're burning bright

When we collide
Baby it's just you and me
This is love
Living in a fantasy
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no, no
When we collide
Babe, it's just you and me

When we collide
Babe, it's just you and me
This is love
Living in a fantasy
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no
Don't wake me up again, no, no
When we collide
Babe, it's just you and
