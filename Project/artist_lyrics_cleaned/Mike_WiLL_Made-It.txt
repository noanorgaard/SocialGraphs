At the end of the video, we can hear a snippet of Future and Mike WiLL Made It’s joint mixtape.
Everybody wanna know where you got your stuff
And you say "Oh man, I got the muthafuckin' plug"
Everybody sayin', "Aye, where you get that from?"
And you feel so coolin' every time you in the club

If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little mothafuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes then y'all go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch but she ain't loyal
Nothin' but love for you niggas ridin' with no tint
Grand total 5 digits make these hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands, dog
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all
And once we hit the club we 'bout to fuckin' go ham, y'all
My comrades want them mils, my comrades want them millions
My comrades want the bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want the tri's, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah we need more than racks, my comrades want them illions

Say my, say my, say my, say my name
Switchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
Avione draped me up nigga
Yellow bone suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate but she call me papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hottie thottie
Put them heels and them nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell niggas nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money
Been proven you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

Your life in my hands for playin' with my bands
You play with my money, I chop off your hands
My niggas be trappin', they trappin', they sellin'
The molly, the gas I can't stand
I'm prayin' tonight the enemy stay out of sight
I'm kickin' and whippin' and trappin' the white
The birds, they're flyin' and singin' like Brian McKnight
Hunnit bands on your head, I'll take your life
Young rich nigga, pockets on Kelly Price
Feel like Bill Clinton, Versace linen
I'm packin' the F&N, see snakes in the trenches
Plenty of bricks in the bando
Put the laser beam on my sniper rifle, I see fuck niggas in camo
Hunnit bands on your head, my nigga, I feel like you're disloyal
Heard he got them truckloads, I took it and put it in the water

The trap trampoline, it's jumpin'
Young nigga, I came from nothin' to somethin'
Now takin' them trips to Bahamas
