Let's have a Mid-City Fiesta with your West LA connection
Hop inside the vehicle, start crossing intersections
We learning life's lessons while we blaze this herbal essence
A man, but still a child, and I have so many questions
Struggled all my life to evade the misconceptions
Then find a place to live between the negatives and positives
While trying to make money slangin' synonyms and homonyms
I went to pop's house so I can visit moms and him
Cut to the mall, copped a brand new pair of Timberlands
Then dipped down a one-way time to scoop up Double K
And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day
My nigga Spliff was sippin' Beck's, I'm slappin' hands with Thes
Locate a shady spot so we can circulate the stress
Mary Jane invades my brain, now I can't complain
I'm sayin', what else is there to do besides relax
Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got you trippin', here watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper, write verbs and consonants
As the words become a sentence, you start to feel indifferent
The stress is out your mind, you feel like the weight was lifted
Terrific, I'm glad we had this time to discuss
I'm outro, call me if you wanna blaze one up

When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind
To kick back, relax one time, and you will find

I try to keep it stress free take every day at a time
Make sure the family's in place, and let the music unwind
I got plans to take charge like major outlets
I ride around the country chillin' in my LA express
On every street corner
The importance of having fun
Empty bottles, spilled tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin'
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin'
Under the blue sky, the state laced in smog
Pollute your quarter inch cables with all the sound that we brought
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game lampin' with his son
Chuck D yo, word up we buggin' over time
From the light to the lime, original star time
It's the Double Kriss One
And Camel brought the ammo
So we can shoot game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the do-rag, replace it with a thinkin' cap
If you didn't know, tell the bro he shoulda known that
We here for one thing and that's to remain
What's the name...name...name...nigga
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind
To kick back relax one time and you gon' find

Yo, L.A., hit me one time, make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin' lucky
For this jackpot I jack spots to fill in my crates
We lay back chillin' and feelin', the music relates
We on the -- to the -- two hangin' with my crew
Bullshittin' while we sittin' down drinkin' on some brew
Until the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickel sacks freestylin' all night
Doin' it right, knowing with time music make it better
My crew banging through blocks like shots from a Berretta
Snub nose to the hoes with problems I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your man's got flows
And I'm leavin' you, so by the time I get to Phoenix
Underground heads will fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests
So God bless crooks who steal loops to keep this shit alive
Something for your troops to sit around and vibe by
From Camel, Double, and Thes, to ease stress
We brought the hip hop so have fun and God bless
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind
To kick back relax one time and you gon' find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
Just let the music take over your soul, body, and mind
Kick back relax one time and you will find

Pop collars to this
Wear ice to this
Drink Cris' to this
Yo, is there somethin' we missed?
Pop collars to this

Is there somethin we missed?
Yeah, like my two way
Throw bows, and do the shoulder shake
We throwin' bows up in here
Do the shoulder shake
Oh shit, my two way
Oops, my shoulder shake
Pull up son, I'm throwin' bows

There was music and joy and marijuana
It was flown up fresh this morning from the
