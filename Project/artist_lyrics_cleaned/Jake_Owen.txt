Hey baby, whatcha doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just living
That American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on

And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey, watch the cup
That I'm spitting my dip inside
And hold on tight 'cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"

We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of "A Country Boy Can Survive"
And I knew then she was my kind of a girl
'Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, "It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you"

Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me

Shot me in love like a shootin' star

Then we sat around till the break of dawn

We were naming all the stars up in that sky
And I named the brightest one right after her
And the summer sunset was something to see
With her leaning all up real close to me
