Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
'Til the right time comes down the road

I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose

Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a you
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too?

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, "You fool, it could have been love"
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me


She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

Thank God for good directions, and turnip 

Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"
You might also like
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
Said "These damn things will kill me yet"

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are

Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and

In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town
Map dot, Camelot, lost and found
In a nowhere town

Starts gettin' late, and
Your runnin' out of stars, so
You and your girl, go
Find a place to park, and

A knock-you-dead kiss

If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right?
I'm barely hangin' on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

The scent of your perfume, floatin' in the air
You're looking like an angel, lyin' on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
We're flying so high like we're never gonna crash

When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog

He never acts like he don't care for my friends
He never asks me where in the hell have you been?
He don't play dead when I want to pet him
I want you to love me like my dog does honey
He never says "I wish you made more money"
He always thinks that pull my finger's funny
I want you to love me like my dog
He don't get mad at me and throw a major fit
When I say his sister is a bitch

We should proly go to work, I mean everybody does
Instead of sitting out here in the middle of nowhere working on a pretty good buzz

Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a licking

But we did just fine, if I do say so myself
A bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else
