I'm in love, oh yes I am
I'm in love, oh yes I am
I'm in love, oh yes I am
I'm in love, oh yes I am
Uh, love, uh, yeah, love

I love my mama, love my daddy
Love my seeds that I wanted so badly
Love my woman who keeps me so happy
Love the raps that I be rapping
Love the tracks that I be rapping on
I love the love I get after I put out a rap song
I love the idea of dismantling the atom bomb
I love the planet that I'm on, my love is long
If my love was a burning rock
I would cry tears for eighty million years
Just to cover you and cool you off
I would birth land, then life, then man
Then stand as a testament and hope love gets to you all
Love everything about who you are
God is everything and I love God so, I love you all
The percentage of what you think is wrong is so small
That all I see is love, even when it gets dark
So I don't bitch when shit gets hard 'cause
All I got is love in my heart

L-O-V-E
Everything in between you and me
Our praises do thank you G-O-D
You make my heart sing, and skip a couple beats
Eyes locked in and knees feel weak
A fresh blue sky, wild flower that is sweet
My favorite four-letter word tied around my wrist
So you know what it is
I lo-lo-love you
I lo-lo-love you, yeah


Love, uh
And it goes something like, yeah
Ooh, baby, I love you

From the first second that I saw you
All I know, all I wanted was to give it all to you
Spend winter, summer, spring and fall just talking to you
If I didn't have a car then, I would walk to you
Rip my chest open just to give my heart to you
I just wanna dedicate every love song to you
I love all of you, not just your beauty or your booty
But I love you when you're moody on a Tuesday
And now that I know you, I can say I love you truly
'Cause, there is no describing how your love runs through me
What your love does to me is spiritual, on a level that's biblical
I just wanna love you like a habitual ritual
I just wanna love you like the God above that sent you
Down to Earth to me, wanna love you like I meant to
Kiss you, I didn't know before, but now I know it's you
You could say you know it when it hit you
It can fill you with life, it can also leave you crippled
But now that I got it, it's the only thing that I wanna give you (Give you)
You truly spoil me (Uh, 'cause)
There's more than I could be
We really could just be
Together, passin' time
Just need you next to me
Just happy that you're mine
My love is like da, da-da-da, da, da-da, da-da-da-da
In perfect harmony
I'll be your MVP
Just put me on the team
'Cause we inspire me
I feel like I am dreamin'
Just look at me, I'm beamin'
Ooh, ooh

I've never cared about turning an older age, ever
Literally, never cared, but turning 40
Like it makes you analyze like where you're at in your life
Than like "Who do I wanna grow old with?"

Look at me, I'm in love
Uh, yeah
I've fallen in love
Was it the money that made you change?
Was it the love from the fame?
Was it drugs? Was it blunts? Cocaine?
Was it gold chains?
Was it the four story homes or the four door Range?
What was it that made you fall in love with the game?
Don't say it was the women
Don't say it's how they— anytime you get up in 'em
Was it the feeling of winning even though you was sinning?
Was it the prize from the lie you was livin'?
How does love become a villain?
Is it when someone gets addicted?
Or is it when love gets conflicted?
Is it love if it's from long distance?
Is it love even if you're not getting it?
Is it love if it can be bought by Benjamins?
I'm living in the world that love things material (Mmm)
Acting like love is something venereal
Love is something impenetrable, 'cause love is imperial
And my love is pouring love out your stereo
But y'all don't hear me though

Cupid dance is the type of love to make you give second chances
The type of love that make you turn down new advances
You'll never catch me holding hands and kicking cans
But the next thing I knew, I got a new man, damn
He caught the shark with a fishnet
I'm rocking heels with the fishnets
Passed heartbreak, now you pay for his debt
Now I gain from her loss
L is for the way you lookin' at me with my clothes off
That's for the O
Now the V is for the vacancy you filled from my heart
And the E is for the effort that you had from the start
So I guess I had to match it, whatever he throwin', I'ma catch it
Whatever he plannin', I came to expand it
Look at me now, guess I'm in love, I know you the one
No limits to what we can become, my love


Don't you know I wanna stay in love with you?
Don't you know I wanna stay in love with you?

Locked in, can't switch, love the details
Won't let up, if you won't, oh well (Uh)
Riding late night, grab my waist, set sail
Grab the mic', take flight, we cannot fail (Now check it)

A distant love, I travel across the world for such
A twin flame ablaze, burnin' twice as bright in the coldest night
Telepathy, read each other's minds
A soulmate, a coincidence that evolves in a destiny overtime
The safest place to confide, the truest balance of life
The love existin' between her thighs will be a less than human's demise
Hypnotized, all I know is love
You see the moon pull the waves in
Symbiotic relationships travellin' in a love language
Until we seek out our space again
No matter how bad communication is
Every song recommendation will tell it all through this playlist
The art of peace, spread love every mornin' before you leave the house
Be kind, everyone's in a battle that they don't speak about
And leap with empathy, not solutions unless they seek out
Give flowers while they can be smelled
This pollination, love is love until the day ends
The only thing pure in the real world than the Matrix, ayo

Locked in, can't switch, love the details
Won't let up, if you won't, oh well
Ridin' late night, grab my waist, set sail
Grab the mic, take flight, we cannot fail
Wonder if the sky is enough to light it
Bring on back the hook, keep 'em so excited
Music is the path to the soul, can't hide it
Stay in love with you, and I really don't mind it
Don't you know I wanna stay in love with you?
Stay in love with you, and I really don't mind it
Don't you know I wanna stay in love with you?
Stay in love with you, and I really don't mind it

Now, just for the record, I'm not saying that you have to dry up and become some old man
But there are certain things that become a little more difficult to get away with once you reach a certain age
Alright, the first thing is to start taking better care of yourself
Listen, you're not getting any younger, and if you want to avoid looking old for as long as
