Take me home to Samsara, Samsara
Lose control like Samsara, Samsara
Come join us we'll make it
Come join us we'll take it
Take me home to Samsara, Samsara

Ohhh... Home to Samsara, Samsara
Ohhh... Home to Samsara, Samsara
Samsara


Don't waste your time, tick tock
Spend eternity on this wheels of life
Take a trip to Nirvana
Let's live it up like Samsara
Someone might tell you life is deadly
But with us it's just one of many
Come on let us set the tone
Follow the rave let's get it on
You might also like
Take me home to Samsara, Samsara
Lose control like Samsara, Samsara
Come join us we'll make it
Come join us we'll take it
Take me home to Samsara, Samsara

Samsara
