I was outside cuttin' up bike tires with my grandson
When out of nowhere

They went, busted up in that weird old white dude's house
He had a cult up in there
White dudes hold the record for creepy crimes

They alive, dammit!
Females are strong as hell
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
It's a miracle!
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
But females are strong as hell

They came out the hole lookin' 'round

And I said, "Nathan, is this for reals?!"

One, two, three, four girls came out
One, two, three, four girls came out

Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
It's a miracle!
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
But females are strong as hell
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
It's a miracle!
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
But females are strong as hell
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
It's a miracle!
Unbreakable!
They alive, dammit!
