Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(Had to hold it down!)
Not the type of nigga that’ll really do the club
Plenty water, double cup, baby, let me know what’s up
Oh… we could have a dream

Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

5'3" with the Crown Royal skin-tone
Plus she brought her own water
Man, she been on
Pearling the joints, she hit me with a couple pearls of wisdom
Now it’s on, had me open like a flip-phone
Flip-mode, every single night it's bussin'
We be learnin' till we leanin' like we off the Robitussin
Keep the pace slow
Movin' with the tempo, know you feel it when the bass low
Waitin' on the break down
I don’t need a peso
Did it for the low-low, girl, the free is what I’m based on
Come and build with me
We could be a couple Masons
No insurance to the growth
Just state farm
Hold on, lady, stay calm
We can have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream, dream, dream
Fall in love, love, love

When the rain don't fall so hard no more
And the bank won't take my card no more
But they ain't gon' pull my card neither
And they ain't gon' pull my squads either
Niggas spit shit, I hock ether
Stephen Hawking, no need for talking
Got a hawk's eye, but I can hardly see you
Talk's fly, pray you're not Aaliyah
I ain't trying to rock the boat, but the flow crazy
I paint pictures, but they're not baroque
More Scorsese, niggas made scores out of instrumentals
Nigga type a script with a pen and pencil
Use words from Scripps National Spelling Bee
Fuck is you telling me that didn't sound better
Spitting it simple? Fuck with me, famo
Ginger ale for your hoes
Not shit else, not even my dick
Man I got way too much on my mind
Got a little light bout as bright as my Bic
And y'all got way too much on the shine
Y'all niggas don't tell enough of the truth in the booth
And it's proof you ain't fucking with mine, sip

Started from the bottom of the map
Roll Tide at the end of the wave
In this bitch ballpoint strapped
Get back, this nigga got a pen to the page
Permanent marks, I'm a marksman, I never miss
Talk shit, that's a hint at your age
Big chain, that's a hint that it cage
They're saying you're sane, but I'm gone in 60 seconds on a verse, that's Mickalas Cage
Fuck with a black young man
I'm everything that it denotes
Shit comes straight from the heart, not a record exec in the back with a remote
Niggas gon' play their parts, save face on a face on the back of a C-note
Everybody wanna be the back of a D-Rose
But I can't go, Van Gogh how I handle
Paintbrush when I paint flows
Niggas in the club throwing pesos
Niggas on the block throwing pitch forks
And not from Barbados
I don't give a fuck how you rep your flag
Catch him in the cut when he roll his truth
And I don't give a fuck how you stuff your bags
Touch the sky, it's much more than trees
What can you tell me about your roots?
Spitting that truth like a cold white rapper, niggas gon' always need some proof
Niggas gon' always need some water, niggas gon' always seek the truth
Niggas gon' always want the messenger dead and they always need the proof

You wanna know about The Healing Component
No, I know, listen
I mean it's whatever. All you're doing is asking me about the healing component, so whatever you wanna say. Like I said I never explained it to you before either
You actually did but okay let's hear this
You don't remember it?
Yes I do
Alright what's it about?
Alright so uh, what is The Healing Component?
Aw, you tell me

Lately a nigga been meditating
Probably overly medicated
But it's heaven sent, I'm not hesitating
No, I no longer have a problem with niggas who act like they've never hated
I mean at least you know now
And for those still looking at me sideways you gotta stop sleeping on the profile
Jawline let 'em know that I can take a punch
Still gotta beat 'em to the punch though
Started drinking water at the party, I ain't even gonna front
Seen him put something in the punch bowls
So many truths go untold
So much proof that something big's about to unfold on our asses
This box is Supreme and so are the mathematics
You don't have to add it, I'm a natural at it
Spread love, try to combat the sadness
Got loud to match this
Dose of reality, lit she hit like jabs from Cassius
These titans clashing
Baby you should grab some glasses
Check you a new perspective
Get a new directive
Fuck fucking up a check, it's a new collective
And they got it for the free screaming

I'm not always talking marijuana when I'm referencing these trees (trees)
Always talking water but that's just the truth you gotta read between the lines
And got you sniffing coke off hundred dollar bills ('llar bills)
We sip the lean, we pop the pills (the pills)
Why everything that's supposed to be bad gotta be such a thrill
Why is praising mediocrity such a skill
It bothers me
When rich niggas with minds below poverty lines
Get to play like they Socrates
I play like apostrophes
I mean I'm over the words unless they verbs
That's when we see curves like sundresses in June
The politicians addressing the youth
Talking the loudest and smokin' the boof
Show me the proof
Who puffing the love?
Who rolled up the truths?
See, as well as figuratively we only smoke gas
Who rolled up the foots?
No oops, just smoke 'em out
Brought the water had these niggas drowning and choking out
Tryna spread The Healing Component
This love through the culture now like
T-H-C, T-H-C
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this T-H-C, T-H-C

See this ain't what you...smoking on a regular, no
Regular I, know that that is some good shit
And it'll get you high (it'll get you high)
It'll get you high it'll take you higher
This ain't what you smoking on a regular
Smoking on, smoking on a regular
This ain't what you smoking on a regular

You see it's really all love
And I never claimed all well my nigga we can put it in stone
And I ain't ever claimed all guilt but I know if it was me in that garden
I probably woulda let all hell loose too
Who knew that a young black man might just swoop through with a new roots crew
Like the first time Mike moonwalked
When you know you got something foolproof
Free love is THC and all this tree get wrapped in truth
I know
This ain't what you smoking on a regular
Smoking on a regular, smoking on a regular
This ain't what you smoking on a regular

Mick - When people talk about love you really only think about the, the pretty parts, the romantic parts of love people don't think about things like loving themselves and what that takes. And that you have to know yourself to love yourself and how difficult of a battle that may be. Uh, I don't think everybody even agrees on what love is or what love looks like, whether it be in the street or personally. Um, and, that's just a conversation that needs to be had and that's just what I wanna do, is start a conversation
I think it's- it's- it's setting myself up to be able to have a lot to talk about and different angles to come from. Uh, musically and lyrically and, and from a point of story telling and, and I think it's just something that we need a lot more of anyway. Whether it be just a conversation or actual acts of love you know what I'm saying? Just starting a conversation 

When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown, right? When the real holds you down, you supposed to drown right?

I was high and I was startin' to lose focus
Then I stumbled in the water, I was trippin', I was chokin'
Saying, "I can't breathe"
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started floatin' way out in the open
'Fore I knew it I was driftin' in the middle of the ocean
Saying, "I can't breathe"
Yeah, I can't breathe
Started wailin', started flailin', I was splashing
Waves crashing all around me, felt the passion of the water
Saying, "I can't breathe"
Yeah, I can't breathe

Dial tone on my hotline, it don't bling much
Sing songs like Tubman, young Steven Morris, I ain't seen much
Just a couple motherfuckers tryna rape the culture
Tell the vultures I don't need lunch, it's like morse code
Gotta be in touch to communicate it to the people, love heals all
Best get your immunization, that THC
So we smoking in here like we fumigating
For the fuckboys, too much truth in me
I don't trust niggas, I ain't preaching at you
I don't touch boys, brought the baggage with me
Like a bus boy, I don't need tips
You could see mines
Rap Genius, you could read mines in between lines
Yeah, they act genius but the way society is set up
Almost like they read minds
You heard Alchemy, boy I'm Magneto, they can't read mines
Niggas bark loud
Talkin' revolution, when the waves come, they turn feline
I been turnin' tricks in the coldest part
Of the deepest water like a sea lion, you could see why
We gon' need some drugs for the situation
Shout out to my plug, it's a lituation
Won't win it through litigation
All we ask is ventilation
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

Seven Nine, King Drive, you can picture me rollin'
Bending corners we was headed to the Rasta
Nigga been blessed but a nigga been sick
And a nigga been stressed, so fuck it, I'm a doctor
Self-medicated, ginger ale in the champagne flutes
And I ain't celebratin'
Just cookin' up crack
Where presentation’s everything, tell ‘em wait 'til I plate it
Patience, I'm faded, like outdated denim
Hearin’ it like this ‘bout as rare as cicadas
The boy got some Miles Davis in him, talkin' all that jazz
Tellin' all that truth, nigga talk your shit
Better watch your mouth, better watch your back
Better choose the right way on some fork in the road shit
And, of course, the path less traveled
Fuck I look like followin' your footsteps?
Don't fumble, 'cause this ain't Sunday football
I ain't at home with a footrest
In fact, I'm in front of the back of your head
But I'm comin' from behind, better look left
Look left like where the fuck is he?
You got time on your head, boy
You got time on your head like you wearin' buck fifty
Do it so clean but it's still so filthy, fuck with me

Really can't talk with me

Until I'm in a white drop top with a smile on my face
And a hand in the air like JFK

Wait, all in your steam better known as a hotbox
Crack rocks in a square, better known as a block
Impaired tryna' move; that's hopscotch
Unfair one leg is a hell of a cock block
My nigga, what an anomaly
My nigga look at the world, my nigga what a monopoly
Drop tops in the hood, and they're sitting on twenty two's
Nigga still on Section 8 though
Trickin' on the low for a ho, nigga
Mama at the crib tryna stretch a couple pesos
Couldn't paint a pretty picture with the tears and her makeup
Better get MAACO, makeovers help niggas make money
But I'ma always talk that James Moody
Most rappers these days is actors
And I can't keep watchin' the same movie
These niggas keep sharin' the same models and these models act like they ain't groupies
I ain't stupid, talkin' Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Monk and Dave Brubeck
I ain't stupid, talkin' too eloquent
I ain't stutter, my nigga I ain't Ruben
Ginger ale for the hoes in champagne flutes
Tell one of them come pour me a glass
She don't act up, she can get this truth
Tell her ass read that while I roll this joint
Nigga tryna relax, 'cause the shit don't stop
I ain't tryna relapse, to that wack bullshit,

1000 Xans'll make you sleep good
What you drinking, don't forget you gotta eat good
'Cause food is a whole ass drug
I mean Ronald is a old ass plug
And he chopping rocks for cheap to keep your whole ass stuck
In a daze, it's a fucking maze through the smoke screens
I'm amazed how we never gave, blowing smoke rings
For the pain tryna acclimate
Give a fuck bout accolades
Ginger for your shorty, treat the water like a cabernet cheese
At the fact that we see
How they lie to our faces and still we choose to believe
I've been exposed to new spaces, it's getting harder to breathe
The black Neo of this Matrix
Directing homeostasis
But still all my homies bleed
No pay phones it's getting harder to leave
Tobacco leaves, run the trees in the breeze these days
Rolling them shits with ease these days
Only thing that put greenSLLIME at ease these days
And they still claiming it's the easy way, yeah
Only thing that put greenSLLIME at ease these days
They still claiming it's the easy way
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched

I've never been afraid of heights
I've never been afraid of lights
I've often got lost in flights drug induced
Fall asleep in mistransition, everyday I wake up wishin'
I can barely see the sun shine through
Cause it's the
