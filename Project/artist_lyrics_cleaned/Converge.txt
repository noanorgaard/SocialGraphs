The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
Dark horse will come

For all those born to die
And those that lost the fight
Let their hard roads be our way out
Let their passion lead the way

The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
Dark horse will come

No matter the man or the machine
Beasts will become what they were meant to be
In the name of lovers, in the name of wars
We'll show the demons for what they are
You might also like
Dark horse ride
Towards the light
Dark horse ride
Onward
Towards the light
