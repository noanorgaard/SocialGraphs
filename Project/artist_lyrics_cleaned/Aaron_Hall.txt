We used to talk and laugh all night, girl
What happened to those days?
Did they all just fade away?
Holding you in my arms made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
What's wrong?
Baby, I need to know,  oh, oh, oh, oh

But now it's a dream (Now it's a dream)
Now I wish you could come back to make come true
(You could come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away, (Come on back, baby)
'Cause baby, I'm missing you
I miss you, yes I do from the bottom of my heart

(I miss you) Oh, yes I do
(I'm talking to you, baby) Hear me when I say
(I miss you) Oh, yes I do
Yes I do
(I miss you) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(I'm talking to you, baby) I'm talking to you
(I miss you) Only to you, baby
You might also like
I thought you'd be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you
And making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here so I can see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me from all this pain and misery
Eh, eh

But now it's a dream (Now it's a dream)
And I wish you could come back to make come true
(Come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away, (But you're long gone away, baby)
'Cause baby, I'm missing you
I miss you, oh, yes I do

(I miss you) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(I'm talking to you, baby) I'm talking to you
(I miss you) You and only you, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I miss you) Oh, yes I do
(I'm talking to you, baby) Hear me when I say
I miss you

Missing you
(Missing you) The way you used to hold me
(Missing you) Hey, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, hey
Please understand how much I really miss you
I'll do anything in this world to have you back again
(Missing you) I miss you
(Missing you) Hey, hey, I do
I miss you the winter, spring, summer
And the fall when we were together
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
(I miss you) Oh, how I hurt so bad
(I'm talking to you, baby) Listen to me
(I miss you) Oh, listen to me, oh, sweet baby
(I miss you) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(I'm talking to you, baby)
(I miss you) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

(Oh, oh, oh) I miss you
(Oh, oh, oh) I miss you
(Oh, oh, oh) From the bottom of my heart
(Oh, oh, oh) To the depths of my soul, baby
I miss you,  oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh) Gimme that love back, baby
(Oh, oh, oh) The way you used to hold me
The way you used to kiss me
Every time I lay at night, all I do is cry
I do love you, baby

I miss you, yes I do
(I miss you) Yes (You know I miss you, yes I do)
(I'm talking to you, baby) Show me those pretty eyes
Please baby, don't you cry (Yes I do, I miss you)
Hold me all night long (I miss you, yes I do)
(I miss you)
Squeeze me, make me warm (You know I miss you, yes I do)
(I'm talking to you, baby)
Oh, I miss
