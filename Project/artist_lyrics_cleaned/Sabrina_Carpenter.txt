They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinkin' that the world
Stopped spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did a heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meaning it was worth the while?

I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded our holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all the sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no

Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me

Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah

As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind

Life gives you pennies, turn 'em into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
The colors and the stars seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away (Not far away)
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on fate, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over

Oh, oh
Oh, 

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh
No, you can't blame a girl for trying
Ooh, ooh

I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying

And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do

And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
And being where I've been, I know that in the end
I'll do it all again

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying

They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them, and so they think they got it made
