And it turned into the longest night of our whole damn lives
Had the wildest times, ooh

It all started with girls on boys, girls on girls
Red heels on the table and I didn't care
It all gets kinda hazy when your heart's fucked up
I got high to forget you, I got high real hard
It all started with a broken heart

It all started with girls on boys
It all started with a broken heart

No, you wouldn't come home, so I stayed out
Hoping I wouldn't see you, with someone in the crowd
It was all kinda empty, so I filled it with rum
It was stupidly crazy, I was comfortably numb

I wanna love out loud but I'm scared to say
It's like a ton of bricks that won't fade away
I do it for you
I do it for you

Now you're in my head and it's out of my hands
When you're in my thoughts, I don't wanna pretend
And I lose control with you
But you're in my head, but you're in my head
I do it for

I do it for you, you

Think I won't feel a thing if I give it some time
But your love is a wave washing over my mind
When I stand my ground, I only get high
Being next to you, my heart is on fire

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the—hey)

We've been on this road
To a place that, one day, we'll know
Adventure to the other side (I am the, I am the)
Searching high and low for the treasure deep in your soul
The fortune teller's always right

Got them red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown

Dancing through the midnight (I am the, I am the)
