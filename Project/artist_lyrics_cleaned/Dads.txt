I've gotten so good at stumbling through ditches
That now I'm starting to fall into holes
When you're this young and so excited
You won't remember to set any goals
You might also 

Yesterday, I found pictures of you sitting in your underwear
A middle finger to your mother, and a fuck you to your father

There's a flag in my doorframe
There's a sweater on the floor
There was a time that you once loved me
But we both know that's no more

But were you sure? Well, are you sure?
But were you sure? Well, are you sure?
But were you sure? Well, are you sure?
But were you sure? Well, are you sure?You might also 

I just keep hoping my brain, my heart, and my guts will stop
Don't call me a coward when I say these things
Just be proud I'm not ashamed of who I am
Just be proud I'm not like youYou might also 

...To not act so upset every time I hear
Your name
Since you've left the home we made
You've been out fucking someone else

A permanent bee sting in my throat
I can’t ever catch my breath

It’s not fair
To tell me to cheer upYou might also
