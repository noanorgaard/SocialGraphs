There's something about a Beatles song, that lives forevermore
The beauty of the harmonies, the sound of the Fab Four
All their music will live on and on (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
They really taught the world to sing (She came in through the bathroom window)

Beatles forever, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"
Beatles forever, "All You Need Is Love", yeah yeah yeah
Beatles forever, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," wooh
Beatles forever, "Hey Jude" and "Revolution" (number nine)

'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat

I try to write a good song, a song with feel and care
I think it's quite a good song, 'til I hear one of theirs
Makes you wonder how they did it (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
I wish I knew the secret, yeah yeah yeah (She came in through the bathroom window)
