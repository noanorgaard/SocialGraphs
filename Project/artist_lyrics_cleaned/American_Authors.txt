I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high, I touched the clouds
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
(Two, three, four)

(Woo, woo-ooh, woo) This is gonna be the best day of my life

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (Soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (Control)

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm going nowhere
I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No, and I don't wanna let it go
I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around
But I get a little lonely, when no one's out
I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
The weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down (down)
I've never been that lucky I've never tasted fame (fame)
I'm always looking for something but I hate changin'
Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there
'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

So far so good
So don't turn back
So far so good

It's been hard
Trying to find the best of it
I'm always hung up on the risk
Don't overthink about it hard
When all that's left is rearranged
And everything is in the way
Don't overthink about it
Don't overthink about it

If I think too hard and never leave
I'll watch the world turn without me
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know
To hide from lions and the wolves
Would never break the fears we hold
All we, all we all know
All we, all we don't know

Don't feel like going home
But all my cash is gone
Yeah, I got nothing to do tonight
I'm passed out on the floor
Up in the hotel bar
But it don't matter, cause I'm feeling fine

I'm thinking life's too short; it's passing by
So if I'm gonna go at all
Go big or go

I'm sorry brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how
I up and left this town
But please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
I make my own luck

How can we both take sides
When we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride
And drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrows filling up my cup
