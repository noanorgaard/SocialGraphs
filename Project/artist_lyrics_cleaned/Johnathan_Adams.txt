But he never caused her nothing but shame

He left home the day she died
From the day she was gone
All he wanted
Was rock n roll porn und ein motor bike
Shooting up junk

He was a low down cheap little punk

Taking everyone for a ride

When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But when he threatened your life with switch blade knife
You might also like
What a guy

Makes you cry

Und I did

Everybody shoved him
I very nearly loved him
I said "Hey, listen to me!
Stay sane inside insanity"
But he locked the door and threw away the key

But he must have been drawn
Into something
Making him warn me in a note which reads

What's it say, what's it say?

"I'm out of my head
Oh hurry or I may be dead
They mustn't carry out their evil deeds"

When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But when he threatened your life with switch blade knife

What a guy

Makes you cry

Und I did

When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But then he threatened your life with switch blade knife

What a guy

Whoah oh oh

Makes you cry
Hey hey hey

Und I did
