It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight

I know an old spot
It ain't that cool
But they got a little dance floor
We can act like fools
We'll ask the DJ to play every song from the 90s
We'll tear it up 'til the sun starts to rise and it's blinding

This is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

Someday we'll have real jobs and we'll probably have kids
We probably won't tell them all the things we did
But we'll make it in the future some way, some how
But we're living in the moment, in the here and now
We don't got alot of gas, we don't got alot of money
But we got alot of jokes and we always think we're funny
It's the simple things that keep us going
It's the simple things that keep us knowing

So let's raise a toast
Here's to all the friends that we'll never forget

'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to
