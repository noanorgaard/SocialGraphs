My queen got machine gun hips, better duck once they go off
Takes aim, no intentions to miss, oh-my, so help us all
And it's close to a flight in the midst of neon lights
And my neighbors, they greet me with bags under their eyes
And they know why

My baby is a freak like me and she knows just what I like
She carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find
She won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls
If they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love

Oh, concubine, what are you made of?
No resource on this earth is that soft
I swear by God you are an angel
Ironic how you help me raise hell

I let it go, surrender control
As she takes me for a ride
Hands in the air, we offer our souls
It's easy when she's on my mind

Ooh, do whatchu whatchu whatchu want do whatchu want to me
Ooh, do whatchu whatchu whatchu want do whatchu want to me

Can I taste your lips and smell your hair
As flavour fills the air?
My fingertips they dance across
Your back from coast to coast
And when I kiss I'll always tell
Make sure the world knows who you love the most

Ooh, do whatchu whatchu whatchu want do whatchu want to me
Ooh, do whatchu whatchu whatchu want do whatchu want to me

Underneath your salty skin
Pressure has me lost again
Underneath your salty skin
You take all my oxygen
Underneath your salty skin
Forget to breathe but learn to swim
Underneath your salty skin
Pressure has me (lost) lost again

Ooh, do whatchu whatchu whatchu want do whatchu want to
