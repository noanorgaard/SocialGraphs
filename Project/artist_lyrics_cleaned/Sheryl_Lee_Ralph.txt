Life is a holiday
I'm talking June through May
A nightly sell out show
And baby I'm front row
Bye-bye to lonely nights
Only nights
When the two of us can coo
Skies are sunny and clear
Long as I'm here with you
The world's a sugar bowl
It sevens ev'ry roll
Sneak peek at paradise
The view is mighty nice
I got no blues to sing
Choose to sing
A melody for two
Happy ending is near
Long as I'm here with you

Happy ending is near
Long as I'm here with you
Who care if there's no booze
Or that the Yankees loose?
Can't pay my income tax
But in spite of the facts
No one could ask for more
Kid in a candy store!
The jackpot has been hit
I'm living proof of it
And as for all that passed
Call that past
I found a heart that's true
What a red letter year
Long as I'm here with you
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you and yeah you too
So happy dear
Long as I'm here with
Long as I'm here with
