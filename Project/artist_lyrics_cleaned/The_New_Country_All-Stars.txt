Where the bad ones? Send the bottle service
I got a hundred for 'em
These ain't retail, got some for resale
I went to London for 'em
Yea, they be telling lies, don't endorse it
Jump, jumped off the porch into Porsches
Might put her on a plane if she gorgeous
Then I make her count the money in the morning
Money counter counting, money keep going
If the feds get behind us, keep going
Bounce, bounce that ass, keep going
Heard you get to the bag, keep it going
Money counter counting, money keep going
If the feds get behind us, keep going
Bounce, bounce that ass, keep going
Heard you get to the bag, keep it going

Long hair then flip it for me, if the mission is the money
Watch me make it appear like ta-da
She like Fenty and Adidas and she rock Prada
But when she work she rock nada, hit the jig like Sada
Drizzy got my new bitch talking down on Benihana
If you knew about hibachi then it really ain't no secret
Scammers throwing money on the floor, you finna keep it?
If you got more than six niggas in your recents
Bust it like a table when I'm finished eating
Gon' scrub it on the ground like it need a cleaning
Got the rubber band bank with the toing yoing
Boing! Make that ass flip like a coin
