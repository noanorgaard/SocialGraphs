Life happens when you're making plans
Flying high and shaking hands
A song will write you, you don't write it
I, didn't mean to fall in love
Was rhythm that created us
I was running, we collided

Baseline, I will always make time
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out
You might also like
With you, I found a new way to live
I see an alternative
Now we started, we can't stop it
I, I didn't mean to fall in love
Last thing I was thinking of
Was you and me but, we collided

Baseline, I will always make time
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out
When the beat drops out
When the beat drops
