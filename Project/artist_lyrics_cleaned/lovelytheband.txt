Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

To fix our broken pieces one at a time
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I like that you're broken

Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with
