(Oh, what a nite) to love you, dear
(Oh, what a nite) to want you, dear
(Oh, what a nite) to kiss you, dear
That's why I love you so

I won't forget all those things
You have told to me
Things in my heart
Won't let me forget your love

(Oh, what a nite) to love you, dear
(Oh, what a nite) to hold you near
(Oh, what a nite) to squeeze you, dear
That's why I love you so
