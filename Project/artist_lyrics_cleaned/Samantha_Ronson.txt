The look, the dunks and the bottle of Jack
The smokes, the slouch and my eyes
Now you think you know what you think you'll find
You think you'll figure me out tonight
But you'll never know what I won't share
'Cause I don't care, no, I don't care
You think you'll figure me out tonight
But I don't care

And I wonder (And I wonder), if I'm just built this way
'Cause every man that I know makes me feel like I'm to blame
When it's over (When it's over), me and my selfish ways
Go back to start again
Go back to start again

Did you ever feel like you should have said
Something smarter at the time?
Did you ever feel like you should have kept
It all to yourself?
Did you ever think it might be your fault?
I never promised anymore
Did you ever think it might not be me?
No, it was always me
