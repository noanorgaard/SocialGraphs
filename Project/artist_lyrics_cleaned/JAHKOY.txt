Tempted by feelings that feel so familiar
Blinded by love and all of the above
Taking by wishes with no permission permitted
I hate that my lifestyle has caused you to think that I'm not committed
The more that I say I don't want it, I know that I need it
You take it away and let me do all the fiening
You know how much I crave you
You know how much I hate to
But you give me that discipline then put some cinnamon on it
Girl damn you're so sweet to me
Do what you wanna
I could kiss on your feet
You got all of the heat on me
Your winning me over
I hate being sober
Just doesn't feel the same anymore
It's felt in my vein
I'm so over the games
But there's no one to blame anymore
You might also like
If it doesn't feel the same anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
Cause it's all on me
It's all on me
If it doesn't feel the same anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
If you could tell me now
Baby tell me what it is
I been looking for an answer
You done put me through the test
We couldn't be just friends
Got me thinking about the masses
How far could we take it if we lifted off
Would you hold me down when things start to pick up
So far left I would hope to get it right this time
Hate to think I barely ever cross your mind
But I think about it way too much
How you gone get fucked up
And tell me it's nothing
Inside it kills
Tell me how it feel
When you really can't feel nothing
Stuck on my words
Why does it hurt
Every time I say something
Sometimes it hit so hard you aim to be numb
But
If it doesn't feel the same anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
And it's all on me
It's all on me

Just want you you you
Girl I just want you you you
I just want you you you
You you you
Girl I just want you to want me
Girl I just want you you you you you
Girl I just want you you you you you
Girl I just want you you you
Girl I just want you to want
