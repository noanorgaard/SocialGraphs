That we were caught up in the middle
Of a worn-out dream
I knew we were in trouble
But, baby, I almost screamed

When I saw you dancin' on the moon now
I watched him spin you 'round and 'round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away while I'm stuck here on the ground

Is there anyone out there?
Somewhere I can belong?
Man, the city just ain't so kind tonight
And if I had my suspicions
I kept 'em out of my heart
Just wish I would've known right from the start

That you'd be speaking in riddles
And you'd never confide
You know I knew we were in trouble
But, honey, I almost cried

When I saw you dancin' on the moon now
I watched him spin you 'round and 'round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind and I'm still waiting to be found

You did a fine job of hiding
That crooked ace up your sleeve
You doubled down my direction
You kiss me on the cheek and leave
I followed you through the darkness
I followed you through the cold
And, woman, I can tell you one thing
You're gonna wish you could go back and fold

Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away while I'm stuck here on the ground
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind, I'm still waiting to be found
Yeah! Will I ever win? Only time will tell
You got to suffer to remember how well
That are our ideals never really marched in time
That's the bottom line
Jilted lovers and broken 

Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before

I used to think that I knew the big time
Before you came around
But I was up in the velvet goldmine
And you put my feet back on the ground
A peace of mind is a lot to ask for
These silly days, but we got it made
Don't let it fade, oh no

I can change, I can change for you
I can change, I can change for you

I can bend, I can break, I can shift, I can shake
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you, I can change for you
Woo ooh, Woo ooh
Woo ooh, Woo ooh

When your time runs out, and you don't know where to stand
I'll step from the shadow, I'm at your command

What's going on in your head now?
Maybe something I said?
I know that you've been living in the past
What's going in your head now?
Maybe something I said

It's driving me crazy, and you can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside, you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

The eyes of God are watching over us
So we don't break the golden rule
The seven seas, have we learned
Or are we sailing on a ship of fools?
I always thought I had a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're running low)
I always thought we'd get there someday

When you close your eyes, tell me what you see
Locked up in your room is there any room for me?
In the spoils of your mercy
In the reverence of your bed
In the cradle of the morning
What was it that you said?
What's going in your head now?

You're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love

I've been working overtime
And I can't get you off my mind
I sleep in the pouring rain
When will you come home again?
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did

I'm hanging on to the end of this rope
Somewhere on the outskirts of hope
Life without you not around
Another kid in Lonely Town
And I'm

Now I'm standing outside your house
And I'm wondering, Baby
Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you feel the thud when I fall?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
Did you lock the door when it shut?
Did you see the knife when it cut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground?
