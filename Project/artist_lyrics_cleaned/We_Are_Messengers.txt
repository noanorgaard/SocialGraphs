Oh Your love bled for me
Oh Your blood in crimson streams
Oh Your death is Hell's defeat
A Cross meant to kill is my victory

Oh Your amazing grace, I've seen and tasted it
It's running through my veins
I can't escape its grip
In You my soul is safe, You cover everything

Oh Your love bled for me
Oh Your blood in crimson streams
Oh Your death is Hell's defeat
A Cross meant to kill is my victory

Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away our sin
Who takes away our sin
The Holy Lamb of God
Makes us alive again
Makes us alive again
Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away our sin
Who takes away our sin
The Holy Lamb of God
Makes us alive again
Makes us alive again
