Found myself in bad company
It still beats the monotony
I get lost in the irony
But it still beats the monotony

Dysfunctional in every way
We drive all night and sleep all day
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling
Deaf ears to everything I say
Beginning to wonder why I stay
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling

Stale talk in bitten tongues
We sit on mute and play along
But there's something about the silence
Can't speak when we're all breathless
The disconnect should feel wrong

Mistake the mindless for bravery
Climb and take in the scenery
I get lost in the irony, yeah
Overcrowded and lonely

Dysfunctional in every way
We drive all night and sleep all day
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling
Deaf ears to everything I say
Beginning to wonder why I stay
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling

Am I a pain in your side? Oh
'Cause you're a pain in mine
Oceans of car parks and street lights, and no one around
We don't get along too well so we don't make a sound

Dysfunctional in every way
We drive all night and sleep all day
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling
Deaf ears to everything I say
Beginning to wonder why I stay
Caught up in the conflict
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling
Am I a pain in your side?
(Puts me on edge but I like the feeling)
Cause you're a pain in mine

Give me a window seat I know the glass can keep me safe
You missed your window when you promised you would change
Give me a window seat and I'll watch you as I drive away
I want to see your face when you beg for me to stay

Boy you got me paralyzed from the waist up
Got so much to say but it's better to run
Cause all the words wouldn't be enough
You always liked to speak for both of us

I carved your name beside my bed
Because I don’t like it when you are far
But how can you make this all about yourself
When you’re so comfortable where you are

I gave you a window seat, I knew the glass would keep you safe
I missed my window when I promised I would change
Gave you a window seat and I'll watch you as you drive away
Tell me you'll face me when I beg for you to stay

You're a middle class pain
And a first-rate name caller
I hate the very thought
But I like you all the more for it
You're a fiery dreamer
An overachiever
Getting lost in the cockpit
Talking our futures right at the start of it

And we're still acting our age
Bursting our eardrums in my dad's car
We're learning everything the hard way
Grazes heal over and we're torn apart
And I hope there's room for you

Will we be grey?
Watching ourselves decay
Will you still be enough for me?
Will you still be enough for me?
Will we pick up if we leave it off?
Can we start again once we have stopped?
Will you still be enough for me?
Will you still be enough for me?

You're a one-way plane ticket
Or maybe you're a crash landing
Going places, no speed limit
I still like you all the more for it
I'm always amazed
By the places you chase
Got a glint where most are dead
'Cause you know what lies ahead

And we're still acting our age
Bursting our eardrums in my dad's car
We're learning everything the hard way
Grazes heal over and we're torn apart
And I hope there's room for you

Will you still be enough for me?
Will you still be enough for me?
Will we pick up if we leave it off?
Can we start again once we have stopped?
Will you still be enough for me?
Will you still be enough for me?
(Will you still be enough for me?)
Will it still be the same when you're a screen?
When my sun goes out, as your one comes to life?
'Cause what we have is good, but I'm stuck on when
Our skylines run on different times

Will we be grey?
Will we be grey?
Watching ourselves decay
Will we be grey?
Will we be grey?
