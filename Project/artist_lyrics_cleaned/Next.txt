Every time I look at sis I got the
Stare and the slow gaze
I'm picturin' us first class, no show a day
Just sayin' no grass, no snow days
Look at me, hooks in me like the O'Jays
Lemme stop tripping and I ain't about trickin'
You got me busting checks and I
Ain't even busted yet

Next, '9-7, 

Ayy, you pulled out a purple flag vers' Ars'
Like you was Crippin' and shit
I dare you pull out a purple flag now that the Crips in this bitch
I heard his parents was rich as a bitch
So if I get this white boy Rob'bed, would that be Ridiculousness?
No MTV, think TMZ when I'm shootin' shit out the whip
I be Wild N' Out, ain't nothin' humorous 'bout the Clips
Pistol whip you 'til your bowels loose and you is about to shit
Keep talkin', pussy, I'll slap the uterus out your lips
You look the type to Catfish a nigga, usin' a lady picture
Nah, you look like a kid that got molested
By his Catholic priest and his baby sitter
Who paid this wigger? I cut your face, let the razor skin ya
A lead pipe put your Chin on a pole like an Asian stripper
Why switch up my style for you, when I can zone out?
Instead of a different approach I'll take my own route
If he was strapped and hesitated to pull his chrome out
I take his gun from him and put this cracker barrel in his own mouth
Get his wig blown out with a street sweeper
We keep heaters, 9 milli's, street sweepers
Think it's a game 'til my peeps see ya
They chop you up with a meat cleaver
Then stuff you right in the deep freezer
I run in cribs, act like you know what the fuck it is
Before I come to yours, kick your door, start dumpin' SIG's
I am at his mother, then bust her wig
His whole family get hit with the machine
That's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids
Who want the biz? I'ma make him eat a Heckler
The clip hang so you know it's more to it like et cetera
This cracker's a faggot, I'm tellin' ya
You was scared when Bonnie grabbed your dick
But you let Pat Stay do that shit on the regular
That's weird shit, that's queer shit, and you a soft nerd
Trip, I'll smack Mark Wahlberg with the Mossberg
Shots fired, shells droppin', all y'all heard
I have the detectives try to solve a puzzle if we cross words
The toolie air ya – try me, I truly dare ya
What I do with a bat the docs won't be able to repair ya
I put a gash in his head, the whole wound will scare ya
When I'm finished he can't fit his hat
I call that leavin' no room for error (Era)
He'd probly sue me if I swung off on him
Hook you up to life support, then pull the plug off on him
We'd fuck Pat's big ass up, you gon' run off on him
Get back smacked 'til the black of my hand rub off on him
Out in London you battled Chilla, they was callin' you "Sharon"
Even though your name is Charron, I guess they just wasn't carin'
But I got a box for you, Sharon, and you won't go in there alone
I have Pat Stay and Sharon sharin' caskets and sharin' (Sharon) Stones
I air the tone, in his skull I'm tryin' to put one
Your face turn purple, your autopsy gon' look dumb
Why you keep talkin'? You the shook one
This white boy gon' die tryin' to hang off Roc(k)
That's Macaulay Culkin in The Good Son
Ayy, if we don't get the job done right once we rock you?
Then we treat white like crack and re-rock you
Why put the pump on his tongue like a Reebok shoe?
I put you in that casket, take you out, then re-box you
Psssst… Gang

He called me Macaulay Culkin, so I got all kind of different flips
I could say it's 'cause I'm in the trap house and pitchin' bricks
Nah, I ain't gonna say that
That's something that Macaulay Culkin had said
I'm more like Joe Pesci though in Home Alone
'Cause I'm fire off the top of the head
I can do anything, I can do a couple flips
I can do shit that you can do, talk about the gun I grip
I can do anything, I can even go rebuttal this
He says it looks like I Catfished someone
Well, you don't know who you fuckin' with
And you heard him call me Wahlberg so I'ma use the lead
The bear will (barrel) talk to this Mark like the movie Ted
He wouldn't put some money up, this bitch is lame
I'ma take Roc(k) Paper for thinking this is a (Scissor) game
I even push zips when I'm travellin'
I take everyone's work and flip it like John John when he's battlin'
Soon as I find out that house that you trappin' in
You come home to an empty crib
With no china/Chyna, you Rob Kardashian
"I'll stick my dick in your daughter's pudding"
You said that to Arsonal? Damn!
After Newark you gon' be M.I.A. like Arsonal's fam'
Out in Maryland you'll get dropped
Hit your ratchet wifey with a motherfuckin' headshot
Got her in a leg lock, hospital the next stop
Flintstones, Bam Bam, your whole family in a bed, Roc (Bedrock)
I saw a picture of your woman
She's beautiful, she can catch pipe
I was all up in her raw dog last night
Nine months later there's a kid, he's mad hype
'Til he sees the color of his skin
And screams "That's light! That's light!"
You know what else rhymes with "That's light?"
"You're being pimped out by Smack White."
He got you on contract for $3,500? That's light
But you thought Jefferson was on the $50
You ain't never had your cash right
On Facebook you apologized to Smack for takin' this match
As a family man you should never be sorry for makin' some cash
He posted, "My loyalty is with Smack
No other league's worthy of these gun bars."
Delete, disappeared quicker than a Tsu Surf gun charge
You think being disrespectful is all that counts
Well, Ars' left URL, started UDubb and bought a house
So what's more disrespectful
You saying you bust a nut on his daughter's blouse
Or you allowing Smack to take food out your daughter's mouth?
You're a big name, go and charge some leagues
Smack don't want you to make bread, it ain't hard to see
Your daughter is gonna cry at Christmas
Like, "Daddy, how come there's no cards to read?"
And you'll be like, "Sorry, princess, this year Christmas is on RNT
Ssmmmmmmack!"
Look at Smack when you and Nitty almost fought
He couldn't stop smilin'
If he says he doesn't make money off you, tell him to stop lyin'
What you amountin' (a mountain) to? He's stock pilin'
He's using you as a stepping stone
To get to the top, he's Roc(k) climbin'
I'll pay someone to kill you, cash deposit
I say get him from long range ain't a cat that saw it
Now Roc get (rocket) from a distance like NASA launched it
The way my Hitman Shot Guns not even Smack could block it
You've had crowd control all of your life
Well, I'm all up in your grill, I make 'em more hype
I got the hands up before the punch: that's a Norbes fight
You lost, call up Mr. Classic and apologize for that
You can make fun of me since I was slapped
But I'd rather get smacked by Shine
Than owe all my shine to Smack
He just used you to stack chips, Shine may have left handprints
But I'd rather get smacked, bitch, than be Smack's bitch
Another URL rapper I get to add to the bag
Was supposed to go against Tsu
But I swore to kill this man from the Cave
Next I want Lux, Mook, I'm coming after the names
I'm just using Roc as a chess piece like Andy Dufresne
And next you want Hollow on URL? Let me close with a fun fact
You just lost to Charron at UDubb
Let's see if they let you come back – two,
