Old
Demented men
Where is the place
We can extend
Crooked state lines
Polka dot signs
Say that this place is
A state of mind
Pretty lip girls
Paint me the halls
Not on a street
Not near a mall
Raise me a thumb
From human skin
That isn't judged by
Where it begins
Show me the clams
Show me the pearls
Mail me a note
Sent from a world
That isn't so far
And always right here
Where all the boundaries
Have disappeared
And all the nights
Are stitched with a glue
That's sticking to me
And I'll stick to you
I'll take your hands
You'll take my face
And everywhere home will
Be a good place
I found myself there a collagin'
With all of the human race
A dancer from Ghana
Smiling in Tijuana
I Frankenstein java with touches of Prada
And corn on the plates
A smear of gardenia
In the fair hair of Sweden
And maybe I actually visited
Some sort of mythical place
Or was it a future
Connected by sutures
Oh let's go get lost in the image
I made of the everywhere place
I see the lads from Osaka
Dyed in FloriDada

Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home?
The bridge that someone's fighting over
A bridge that someone's paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home?
The bridge that someone's fighting over
A bridge that someone's paying for
A bridge so old so let it go
Where's the bridge that's gonna take me home?

FloriDada, 

But inside I'm okay
I can live without your time
Where snowmen never melt
Instead they always shine

If you don't believe in fantasy then don't believe in fantasy
But do you not believe in fantasy because it gets you down?
If you don't believe it's raining I won't tell you that it's raining
But do you not believe it's raining just because it gets you down?
If you don't believe in happiness then don't believe in happiness
But if you don't believe in happiness then man you must be down
If you don't believe you're dying I won't tell you that you're dying
But do you not believe you're dying just because it gets you down?

Our homes are all white
And we go dancing on a lake
And sleds will carry us tonight
And snowflakes will blow us on our way

Drifts rise to the sky
Rainbow hats fly down them
And tears are frozen diamonds
So we smile while we're crying

Golden Gal on her screen
Some kind of tune she'd never seen
Gift to the girl ready to dream
Hope in new forms the elderly be
Spirit is burning to hear it for the girls again

So complex and brave
A power and lure without showing some legs
Different roads, not just sexual things
Went and cut a rude hue, said it did right away
And I'm keeping it new, and relearning girls again

It's a strange kind of plot who steps and paves the golden way
With a humor that is known to quickly put me in my place
Every word's so tricky, how we know what to say
My gal you're so strong you should hold your head above them
And you need not ask for much to get my praise

Let me dress up like a golden gal and have my golden day
Let me watch the mark of maleness from a table side in greys
I can only dream of how I'd be so amazed
The Gals were right on, when she needed laughs to fall on
For all of this and more, I give them praise

"A man?"
"Fly trap"

You think the gals should feel so comfortable these days
But sex and gender bring some troubles to the fray
And trouble tears apart another golden heart
So I want to be the reminder that she's stronger than the bulk on other days

Golden Gal, gave me my strength
She said I'll be here for you later, boy
Now run along you have to fall
Golden Gal, gave me my faith
And all it took was some belief
But don't believe that she should change at all
Golden Gal, taught me restraint
She said you'll want me more much later, dude
I'm your everything and not your toy
Golden Gal, I'll be beside her
And I might want to stand in line
To find the kind of mind she can provide
