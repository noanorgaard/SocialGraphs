Oh, how can I forget you, girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

When shadows fall, I pass a small café where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh, how can I forget you, girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

You might also like
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there

Oh, how can I forget you, girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind
