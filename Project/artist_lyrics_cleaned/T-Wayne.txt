Uh
Alright
Listen up y'all, it's CJ
Chillin with my chums on a B day
I might screw this up
So please give me some leeway
Make them all go down like exponential decay
And we just took two more up for a three way
Right, picking up speed like we was on the freeway
CJ, Bro, Xander on the beat, slay it three ways
Educated man though, that's what she say
Get a diploma, maybe an MBA
Making my own beats, I don't need a DJ (I really do though)
Everyone here taking shots like they were in the NBA
Like "Oh, it's June 15, but that's no D-day"
What did he say
She say
Y como se dice?
You know this is fire like the cliche
And it's out now, don't worry, no delay
You have it your way like BK
I don't need to hand it off, this is a sprint not a relay
Got the club going up on a Tuesday that's a weekday
And if I was gonna be lewd right now, I'd say BJ
You might also like
Alright, got it back like a rebate
In here with the chums, they're my teammates
Beautiful like a land or seascape
Artistic like a screenplay
Melodic like Enrique
Get ready, you know that we slay
When I spit a eulogy there's no choice but to cremate
Just listen and appreciate
Enjoy it like a free cake
Walk into lunch it doesn't matter if we late
Don't worry, we straight
Everyone came up but they just don't equate
Don't know if you could relate
Let me restate
On a chair on exhibition
Missouri
Show me state
Conquer this all like Alexander the Great
I'm pulling hella cash when my stocks reach the maturity date
I'm killing this beat
What's the mortality rate?

Pulled off the song and the mixtape in three days
Put in by the Fifteenth day
In math, we spit Nasty Freestyle like T-Wayne
Hype it up at the lunch table
But only ever on a B 

Yah, say Roro, you know what it is, right?
Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem

First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, "when you blow up, don't forget me", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', "Who Is Rickey Wayne?"
That me...You might also
