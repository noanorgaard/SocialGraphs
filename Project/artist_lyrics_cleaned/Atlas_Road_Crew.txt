Freight train running
Slow down, get out of the way
Once you’re gone, you’re gone
It’s kinda tricky like a Mississippi Hippie
Black water soul runs right through me
Nothing you say can bring me down
It’s what it is, it’s what it ain't
Dark shadows and blood red stains
Creepin’ in, coming over me
But you gotta give a little love to yourself
Heaven’s not too far away
Don’t spend all your time running ‘round in my head babe
Take them away
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Oh, I go blind, I go blind
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
Wander West, whiskey breath
I can feel my heart beat out of my chest
But I’ve never known any other way

I hear the voices, too blind to see
With a little love, I’ll be set free
Erupt, a single light shining might be enough
To carry on, I’m on my way
But you gotta give a little love to yourself
Heaven’s not too far away
Don’t spend all your time running ‘round in my head babe
Take them away
Voices in my head
Voices in my head
Oh, I go blind, I go blind
Well I don’t mind, I don’t
