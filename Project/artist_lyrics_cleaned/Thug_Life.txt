June 16th, 1971
Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin' heavenly son
See, the doctor tried to smack me, but I smacked him back
My first words was, "Thug for life" and "Papa, pass the MAC"
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers ballin'
Listen, you can hear my mini fourteen callin'
From out the window of my drop top
I got my Glock cocked, bustin' at niggas; when will it stop?
Now, tell me, are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes, I see visions
And even with this thug livin', will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have your Nikes on, 'cause when we fight, it's in the middle of the night with no lights on
Hey There must be a God, 'cause I feel lucky
Paranoid, out my mind, 'cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never die, I'll be a hustler, motherfuckers
Makin' thugs out you suckers, from the cradle to the grave
You might also like
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave, since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin on my daddy just to take his ass away
And mama always workin', tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young nigga's being raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle, strung out on drugs
A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats, one black and one of chrome
Now, I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I must defend mine
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say I made it this far
Many G's died, hogs
And all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinkin' about the times, life goes on
I'm steady lost in this land, that's the war zone
I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely, so I married my Nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home without my sugar, I'ma have to plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he laid a hand on me
Since then, that been known
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
'Cause I stay shootin' at marks
Get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame
Somebody peel my cap, and put me in my grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in Hell on Earth
From day one, it wasn't fun, I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum
I tried to cope, loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short, so now I gotta slang dope
In the game filled with pain, it's a fuckin' shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin' 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn, I'm gettin' my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock, slangin' rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin' cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen, I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk, reminiscin' 'bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt
But from the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

Time's movin' fast; will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my AK
Did I sell my soul as a young kid? All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me, but they never did
I can't take it; will I make it to my older age
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage?
Lord, help me, guide me, save me
'Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me: crazy
Do or die, nigga, pull the trigger, don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin' murder on my mind and my TEC-9
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga, you wanna die?
I get high, then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set, 'cause I'm comin'
Start runnin', yellin' "evil mind" as I'm gunnin'
One in the chamber, for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginnin' is a endin', am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave, from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been 

Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failin' out of school
Cause I was livin' by the street rules
Hangin' with hogs, droppin' dawgs as a little loc
I was gettin' my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slangin' them whole thangs
Focused on my mail name ringin' like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm ballin' and kickin' up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggas know not to fuck with us
Cause I'm livin' on the edge, I'm blastin' lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame

I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hellll
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggas, my niggas kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggas after me
Tryin' to peel me, 'cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop 'til my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame

All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip and though my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before you're buried
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to Heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch, don't wanna die, then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm tryin' hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends, damn
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm

From my heart to the trigger, you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without you, nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'Lac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me, Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowin' which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
'Til we meet again, homie

Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mac 10

Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin', watchin' my homies leave the Earth
I know soon, one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is, "That's fucked up"
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (My nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads, real soon
For now, let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of you, homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me?
We know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome
You only live once on this Earth
A nigga had it bad since the day of my motherfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will you mourn me?
Yeah

I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah)
How long will you mourn me?
How long will they mourn my brother?

How long will you mourn me?

How long will you mourn me?
I wish it would have been another

One of these days I'll, learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
Cause they, turn
Into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of being stuck in the county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound when they're postin' bail
Smokin' blunts in the driveway
My 4-5 screamin', "fuck the police" won't fly away
Thug 'til I die, you wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't turned out, I was raised this way
I'm thinkin' these, are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme, and stack green over crack fiends
One time can't hold me
One of these days, we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
I'll finally lose my mind if the pigs succeed
I'm stressed, smokin' weed and nicotine
But what a nigga really need is Thorazine
Right before I die, I'll be cursin' the law
Reincarnated bitch, even worse than before
My 4-4's givin' payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini 14
Servin' suckas like dope fiends empty the whole thing

That's right

Never run, throw your gun in the air, oh yeah
Nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Causin' ruckus mothafucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel razors, boy, we cut shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the 4-pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in the depths of hell
But when I'm walkin' on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell, nigga, I stand too tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin' my all, some niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocaine, and lay their ass down, G

Under Pressure

(Yeah, look here though)
Runnin' wild, I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now, I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about the past, it was all bad
Shots blasted, will I last in the wrong path?
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckas is gettin' shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick cause I'm addicted to get splifted?
Watchin' stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothing's changed cause in the game it's a steady aim
Fuck friends, 'cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock, G
Car keys and Hennessy, where the Glock be?
Times passin', will I last here another day?
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's gettin' hectic, I can't call it
House full of alcoholics
Now a nigga's under pressure
Yeah, that's right
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
Yeah

When the pressure's on it's a hit

Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
A young G gettin' paid off of dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play?
I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
And comin' home at six o'clock in the mornin'
Hands on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four (Tre-four, nigga)
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on gin with a couple of friends (Haha)
Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to the rules wasn't made to simp (Biatch)

More trouble than the average
Just made twenty-five and I'm livin' like a savage
Being a G; it ain't no easy thing
'Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
And, for the rest of your life, you will sit and reminisce
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to the Gs, you can feel my pain
Until the motherfucker gets born again
Bury me a G

You thought it was a game, kid? I'm not the nigga for playin' games
I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge
I'm on the rampage, makin' runs for the Devil

I'm tryna ride, no more loves for me, hard to figure

I got nothin' to lose, so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' to slangin', now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid the price to be the boss
Back at school, broke the rules on gettin' tossed
Poppin' rocks on the block was a pastime
Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
Don't cry, I die before they play me
From the cradle to the grave, bury me a G

Straight thuggin', kickin' it with the homies in the hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, my bitch said I'm no good

Never had no time for no bitch, just slangin' rock
And bustin' caps on you punk ass marks
