You'll be happy, and I'll be happy too
Today I am sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, living without you
But I wish that we could stay together
Stay together, I love you
Today I am sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, living without you
I wish that we could stay together
Stay together, I love you
Maybe someday, you'll be happy
You'll be happy and I'll be happy too
I wish that we could stay together
Stay together, I love youYou might also 

That I've just begun
Under a purple sun
There's many reasons we are what we've become

I'm going through changes
Ripping out pages
I'm going through changes now

And I knew it once, but I forgot
I'm going through changes now
We want everything but what we've got
I'm going through changes now

Maybe it's too soon
Under a purple moon
But I'd ride off with you in a big balloon
You might also like
I'm going through changes
Rattling cages
I'm going through changes now

Things could be different
But I don't know how
I'm going through changes
Through all of the strangeness
I'm going through changes
