And I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would have put yourself in my suitcase
I love you
Standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast

And if you shake her heart enough, she will appear
Tonight, I think I'll be staying here
And you never did like this town
I talk out loud like you're still around

And I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would have put yourself in my suitcase
I love you
Standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast

So pack up the bags to beat back the clock
Do I let her sleep or should I wake her up?
You said we both go together if one falls down
Yeah right, heh
I talk out loud like you're still around

And I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast
I wish you would have put yourself in my suitcase
I love you
Standing all alone in a black coat
I miss you
I'm going back home to the west coast
I'm going back home to the west coast
I'm going back home to the west
