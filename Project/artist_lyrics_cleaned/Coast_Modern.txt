Running, running, running from my problems
You'll be sitting pretty baby, hold on tight
Racing towards a dream on the horizon
Gimme something better than this Hollow life

I'm starving for an answer
I'm dying for an antidote
This planet's moving faster
Why don't we hurry up and take it slow?
And we could chase the sunrise, the sunrise
I been waiting my whole life, my whole life
To sleep under the moonlight, the moonlight
So tell me what you're thinking, babe

Fever's breaking us in two
But in the end it's just a daydream
Are you feeling like I do?

Maybellene on a cheap guitar
Blowing rings and we're shooting stars
Fifty-five down the boulevard
And now I'm cool
Black tie by the swimming pool
Popping pills, seeing two of you
Stuck around for a rendezvous

Coming out of the pool with the sunset dripping water down her spine
It was the pink and the blue, gave me double vision
I could not believe my eyes
She said, you're cool, baby, cool, baby
Do what you do, baby, making me go wild
I said, I don't try
Every day I wake up feeling like a million dollar bill
It's just my life

'Cause now I'm cool

Wavy designs and ripples in time
It's a feeling of emotion that I just can't describe
We're swinging from vines
Eatin' lemons and limes
We're two waves in the ocean

I called the shots, made the plays
'Til you came around and stole my flame, girl
Now I'm a lack of life, breathing slow
Looking 'round for a way out of these chains

Past the creek at the forest's edge
In a field, we rolled the stones
Made a shrine to the summertime
But now it's filled with snow
And the home of a wolf
In the night I have spied it looking in on me
I bet in its head it plots the death of all humanity
And the things that we built for ourselves
'Cause we know without magic
Heaven would be hell

'Cause on the trees, the nectarines
Are dripping with that sunshine
It's so ripe, it's overripe
It's grapevines
It's alcohol in January
Freezing so it's necessary
The bottle up that moonshine

Hear the siren call my name
I feel so warm inside
Drifting into the light
All my life before my eyes
Saltwater on your skin
I'll never taste again

No, not today, I won't be brought down
I didn't come this far just to lose it now
I won't go underground
I'm not ready, I'm not ready

I'm going down deeper still
Reaching for the sky
We were in love way back when
Bring me back to life

But I'm burning all my daylight sleepin'

I want you to know that I'm still tryin'

Breakfast in bed
See sunlight through the curtain
When she leave me she said, "Why does love lead to hurtin'?"
I said, one thing's for certain, I ain't preaching no sermon
But if it aches in your heart
That means that something is working
Don't think for once it ain't worth it
Don't think for once there's no purpose
That's why when I see you on caller I.D. I still get nervous
Yeah, I know it's not perfect
But let that glow shine

Woke up with aspirin
My lucky talisman
Bring me back to life again
Don't wanna be a vegetable

The story of my life
Even if it's all a lie
We still got an alibi
We're just a bunch of animals
Diggin' into rabbit holes again
