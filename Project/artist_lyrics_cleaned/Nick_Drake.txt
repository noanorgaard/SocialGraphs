You can say the sun is shining if you really want to
I can see the moon and it seems so clear

You can take the road that takes you to the stars now
I can take the road that'll see me through
I can take the road that'll see me through


You can take the road that takes you to the stars now
I can take the road that'll see me through
I can take the road that'll see me through

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears, they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say
You might also like
And time will tell you
To stay by my side, oh
To keep on trying
'Til there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

Time has told me
You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean

Look around, you'll find the ground
Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise
For down below they never grow
They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes
Never a surprise

Take your time and you'll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see what's meant to be
Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before

Don't be shy, you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done, if only you see
Just what you are beneath a star
That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free
Yes, be what you'll be

Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?

Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes, that's day
And open wide the hymns you hide
You find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what you'll say

About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people around your head
Who say everything's been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the 

I could be here and now
I would be, I should be, but how?
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more
I could have been your statue, could have been your friend
A whole long lifetime could have been the end

I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be, through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock

I could be, even here
I would be, I should be, so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things
