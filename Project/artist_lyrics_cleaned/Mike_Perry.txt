Giving in to your touch
I can never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

Ocean
Ocean
Ocean

You can be my safety zone
Somewhere I can go when I feel alone
That's all I need, all I want
Is to stay a little longer now
Arms around me like a border
Like an endless stream
You take me in
To a place that I've never been
Now I'm
You might also like
Giving in to your touch
I will never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

Ocean
Ocean
