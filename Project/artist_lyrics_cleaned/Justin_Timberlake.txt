Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancin' on my head
For too long, too long, too long
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong

It might seem like I'm catchin' somethin'
That's because it's true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
'Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (And I know that)
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zoomin' in on you
Everything is extra and the background just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun
It might seem like I'm catchin' somethin'
That's because it's true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful

Under the water, you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach, picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do

Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch

Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence

They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime

Such a beautiful girl walkin' down the street (Sing it)
Seen those bright brown eyes with tears coming down (So he said to himself)
She deserves a crown, but where is it now?
Mama, listen

Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my—
You might also like
Runnin' fast in my mind, girl, don't you slow it down

How would you like to fly? That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown, oh, hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

Señorita, I feel for you (Feel for you)
You deal with things that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (He don't love ya, baby)

Ah, ah, arms (Bring it down, h!) (Baby, won't you lay in my)

Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See, they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing somethin'
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
"It feels like somethin's heatin' up, can I leave with you?" (Alright)
And then the ladies go:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leavin' with you"
Guys, sing:

Gentlemen, goodnight
Ladies, good morning
And that's 

I kinda noticed somethin' wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kinda weird to me since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
You might also like
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down, baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here, baby, put on my jacket
And then
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Ooh)

Ma, whatchu wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see? I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall, kids ask, "How'd the chain glow?"
Point to her, they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride with me, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl
Ho
Ain't nobody love you like I love you (Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust you (Makes me trust you like I do) (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (Hey)
You will know the difference when I—
Break it down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (Hey)
It's kind of special, right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes, people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now, everybody 

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love

Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you'd been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

Girl, my love, my love
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you're hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends, so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what'd you mean, you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)

You didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day, baby
They all say I'm crazy 'cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me that she's in love with me
You might also like
Now, we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't even care nothing about it, babe
'Cause since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same (Yeah)

Mmm, I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me that she's in love with me

My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

(...the bridge)
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say?
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl
I told you I'm in love with that girl, ooh, oh, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, oh, no, no, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
‘Cause I'm in love with that

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
