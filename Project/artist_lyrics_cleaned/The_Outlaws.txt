Now, if I let you see this place where stories all ring true
Will you let me past your face to see what's really you?
It's not for me I ask this question as though I were a king!
For you have to love, believe and feel
Before the burst of tambourines take you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, soul, and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Those who don't believe me, find your souls and set them free
Those who do, believe and know that time will be your key
Time and time again I've thanked them for a peace of mind
That helped me find myself amongst the music and the rhyme
That enchants you there
You might also like
Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, soul, and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Yeah! Eh! Eh! Yeah! Play for you
