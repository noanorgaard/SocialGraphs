Keep it one hundred, I’m one hundred and one
I ain’t talking dalmatians up under the sun
On the road to Damascus, gun and a suit
You either coming with some products or you coming for loot
I’m coming with the peace so I’m chucking the deuce
I ain’t tryna run a train I’m just in the caboose
And I’m tryna give these niggas the truth
I ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em, give ‘em light
I’m just doing my Zeus
Rubbing on her body just like a masseuse
And it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce
But if you blink twice nigga you can Medus'
See the snakes in here, look there's hate in there
I pray that you niggas all playing fair
You can’t help but stare as you face the glare, yeah
I’m not up on in short yellow
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows
Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils
I can rock this shit on all levels
Straight up out the ES, journey over BS
I’m like a hundred kilos stuffed in the Prius
I’m going hard ‘til they free us

Have you ever put your hand over fire
Just to see what you could tolerate?
And you can find no escape
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
To make you mind your mistakes
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up
Charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up
Yes, I’m the child with the crookedest smile
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks
You can’t swim if you don’t paddle
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note
That’s when I noticed the switch, niggas is turncoats
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
Eye on the clock, ain’t no need for alarms
Just get on your A-game when it’s time to perform
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
So what it feel like?
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo

Whole lot of flavor, flavor

Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

No-no-no-no-now, now, you know what this is
Tell 'em, "It's a celebration, bitches"
Where the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes?
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from, we do concrete backflips
Flip-flop, flip-flop, flip-flop back
Through the ghetto's where I bring hip-hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me "Keep it pushin'"
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

From Compton to Baltimore, I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a Section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted, the air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo (Huh?)
And I peel off in the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (Huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh, my
Hear the siren, walk up— drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
Engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, mad respect, representin' the hub right

The homegirls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slingin' cavi'
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fireball, call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint a picture so perfect
Hear my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hundred beat
Got my Crips and esses at arm reach, one West
