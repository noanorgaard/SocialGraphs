Sometimes I think I'm moving too fast
Cause if I crash while I'm moving you laugh
Who's mad? Who's glad?
Who's sad that they can't do that?
Just finished rolling up two bags
Of bluegrass, the new hash
I'm in heaven I don't wanna move back
My life was a lie, now I'm living true facts
My situation good and my bitch is too bad
And I get her wetter than a swimming pool (Splash)
Flipping new tracks, hitting two bad
Bitches who have picture cool pass
If I kiss them while they listen to the sickest dude rapping
Ripping instrumentals, intuition do matter
Does matter, this the new tactic
Get the clue bastard, this the new pattern

Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine (Press C)
Just jump til you get to cloud nine
You might also likeI know what you wanna do
I know everything you're trying to be
I know what you think is true
And I know just what you're trying to see

Can't believe it man, I made it this far
Life is harder than a Jadakiss bar
But I gotta live a life of justice
Life is a beat and I gotta do it Justice
Trust it, that's how I know I got substance
So you can't blame it on substance
Played my music for the devil and he loved it
Called God and said I've had enough
It's time to give it up, let the little nigga have it
The little nigga's a savage with a real nigga balance
Being real ain't a real nigga talent
Being a real nigga is a real nigga talent
Seven and seven is fourteen
The letter N, nigga support me
And you my nigga if you feeling the vibe
Just keep it real and don't consider your eyes
I ain't even worried 'bout clouds on my path
Cause I done rained on clouds from the past
So when they wanna get down I just laugh
You can kiss the True Religion crown on my ass
That's how I get down with my bad, self
I'm James Brown when I black
I feel good, no pity party
I'm in everybody nose like N.E.R.D

You got to move wit the groove
As she lay on the one's and two's
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You gon stink up the room!
Wit that big ol' ass!

Yo, we gon hit something
I'm cutting the rug wit love
Or I'm on the wall pressed up against something
You should let em know the boss is back
So y'all niggas that went wood go get more shalack
I see bowlegs backing it in
I put it on her wit the ol' school two step, clap and a spin
Filled up her cup, slid her a dutch
You know what's happenin then (What?) in
And all I did was having a grin
Off top let her know I ain't one of these dudes
Rhyming to lose, naw ma I'm rapping to win
Yeah! yes! They know the God be fresh
I'm on that ass blowing purple on the washing set
And even though I came wit thugs
You still might catch a few of them 'Stepping In The Name Of Love'
Uh! It's D on the Block, the Ryde is Ruff
And you wit the motherfucking Billionaire Boys Club!

Gangsta leanin', Kiss be in the bank wit cream and
My wrists and my neck be gleamin'
Whatever I got cost, Honey look hotter than Hot Sauce
That's why I get top in a drop Porsche
Then she get dropped off, told her that the whole block pop off
She come through, take them rocks off
And therefore, wanna know, what would they stare for
They heard about the work, it's as white as your Air Force
Maybe it's the voice that the world got an ear for
Most of these rappers, I just don't care for
So I be on the honies wit the big ol' asses
Hypno and Cleako in big ol' glasses
We could do the damn thang, order the champagne
Honey's Head of the State, and I'm running the Campaign
If you coming, c'mon, if not I'm gone
Other than that, yo Pharrell, sing my song!

Hey yo, Honey got a goon thinking
That ass like that, she could have the room stinking
I - picked her up in the maroon Lincoln
Blew her back out until the moon sank in
Spend the profit, hold on the to the re
Lock me up, hold on the to key
I want you to wake up in the morning wit me
I got it bad for ya, breakfast and a cab for ya

You got to move wit the groove
