Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat

The night is young, the night is free, and so are we
So let it out and let me stay inside your drink
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star lie on the window tripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah, you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here tryin' to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waitin' on a call from an angel

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes

And she's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord," she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

She was smoking hot, a whiskey shot of Jericho
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

I'm sittin' by a bonfire watchin' her swayin'
Me and my buddies and the guitar playin'
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

July flames, October ashes
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
We never said goodbye, we let it fly into thin air
Tonight I'm stoned on long-gone love so strong, I swear

That post game party field you circle up on
