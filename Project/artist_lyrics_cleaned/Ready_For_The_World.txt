Oh, baby, love me right
Let me love you 'til we get it right
Why can't you let the others be?
'Cause with you is where I got to be
Oh, suga, where you been?
Hangin' out with your male friends?
Listen, somebody's gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

And we sing
Oh, oh, Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
(See the sun)
Oh, oh, Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh, baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own fun
Oh, baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well, honey, baby, just you wait and see
