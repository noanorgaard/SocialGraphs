All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal
All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

Rising from the vapour misted patterns, voices left behind
From the vapour misted patterns, can we stay a while?
Guess I'm sick of things being the same
Doesn't have to be every day, never change
Just recycling things I thought were true when I was younger
But I'm older now, I should've listened, oh
The splinters left me blind, I had to change my mind

But constantly, it all seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal
Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

Our love was a weekend on the water
Silly me for thinking you would want me longer
My love found a home under the water
Glory be, 'tis the season for a slaughter

Girls and men now know what they want, there's no sorrow now
Once you love that mistake, got you sorry right now
If I had it all my way, I'd be with you right now
Haunted by a memory, yes, I'm with you right now

This kind of life never just slip your way
I gave up taking carefree trips to the Bay
Cali'-bound is 'cause I got a flip in L.A
Paris-bound 'cause a new video's on the way
No breaks for me, no vacay for me

Why start shit you don't finish?

So, I pray, I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling, yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

Here, I pass the day in a most peculiar way
Watching ships out in the bay and I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight? As the day becomes the night
And I don't want to be right, right
