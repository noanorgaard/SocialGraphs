Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to, you're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me when I just wanna make you smile?

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel, I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna do you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how ya—
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Hey! Hey!)
Baby, you're so classic (So classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Classic)
Baby, you're class and baby, you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever till we met
A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s
Got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies (Oh, woah, woah)
Queen of the discotheque
A '70s dream and an '80s best
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, massive (Ah)
Girl, you're timeless, just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind (My, my, my, my mind)
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind (It's love on rewind), everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how ya— (Woo!)
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen (Mm)
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Woah-ooh-woah-oh, uh, woah-ooh-woah-oh)
Baby, you're so classic (Hey yeah)
Baby, you're so classic (

We broke down trying to leave town
Flying down the road to change
We were born to run, Cali', here we come
Escape from Nowhere, USA
Say good-bye to white picket fences, say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you got to fall to have it all
And we don't want two kids and a wife, I don't want a job, I just want a life
Sometimes the underdogs rise and the mighty fall (And the mighty will fall!)

This ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
'Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So, tell me, whatever happened to the American Dream?

I know a girl, I met her last night
She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear (What'd she say?), "Baby, come here
I'll do anything to make a name."
Honey, take my hand, follow me 'cause I don't want to hurt you, but he does
I just want to give you some real advice (Listen, baby)
Never take candy from a stranger and keep your eyes open for danger
Because this right here is a twisted paradise
