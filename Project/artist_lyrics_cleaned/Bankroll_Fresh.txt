Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
Know my frames, they’re killin'
All these hoes I'm killin'
Nigga came from dope-dealing
Dirt bike, four-wheeling (Woo)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling (Skrr)
Come up in the street, I'm peeling

And I might just lose the ceiling
And I'm trying to grind up on a million
And I might kill it if feel it
Hell yeah
Yeah, damn right I kill it if she give it
MAC got extension
Take it and we flip it
Take it and remix it
Bring it back, Sixteen Curry on them hoes
Bank too big, need pockets like Girbaud
Hold up, wait, know exactly how it goes
It's Boochie

Fully-loaded diamond on both of my wrists
Me and Joblow gon' scheme on your bitch
Alley to my nigga, getting money out the six
Street Money Nino got a hundred in the six
Ain't no gas I'ma juug this mid
Pint coming in, I'ma lean like this
I hit hard like, "Shawty, you lit"
Fuck all you rappers, my trap look like Casper
Came in like this turning up on you bastards
After I smash lil nigga can have her
Fuck from the front then I'm turning her backwards
Ask all those strippers, I stay with that cash
I'm in a dipper, I'm moving them bags
Play with that money we put on a mask
Knew no limit, we bustin' your ass

Smokin' this shit up, I made a cloud
Just fucked it up at the after hour

Stinking-ass breath smell like Black & Mild

Thank God, a nigga rich, hallelujah
I flew her out, and I barely even knew her
I fucked her, now that bitch Luda

Walked in this bih looking like Frank Lucas
Me and my goddamn shooters
Carbon got a goddamn cooler
Clip like a goddamn ruler
These bitches faded be acting funny

Get her on molly, she be actin' slutty
Hit from the back and she ate her buddy
