Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One, one
One, one
One, one
One, one

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters and my brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One, one
One, one
One, one
One love, one 

When you love someone, it's natural not demanding
That's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you
I'm so glad we reached that understanding
Now I know my heart is safe with you
So now my love to you, baby, I surrender

Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, oh baby, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Celebrations and my heart could stay united
And there's nothing in this world to come between me and you
We're together and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of love can do, ooh
And I'm filled with a love that's oh so tender

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
