Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do!
Just say...

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go
Just say...
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone
And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue

A great divide between us now
Something we should know

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know

There's a mountain higher than we knew
It's high but such a bitter view
