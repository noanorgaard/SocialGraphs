F is for friends who do shit together
Like governments niggas fucking up the weather
U is for you and me shooting it out
Niggas get creased like scalps
And we so smart for the slang that we started
Just give me the  and the parchment
38 ain't nothing but a number
Take a trip to my land of wonder

Out the hoodie get hot in the summer
On the wave, diamonds beating like drummer
Get the cash in, new bag I need all of that
Madwiz, that's my brother before the rap
Pack fits, ship it out we go order that
And we taxin', niggas finessin' for real
I'm drinkin' I feel like the King of the Hill
In the whip, it's me, Bundy, Fifty, and Millz
You might also like
Lin my niggas in coerce
We wish you the best but I'm the worst
Cop the henny, then the Murc
Charging 2 million for a verse
Bitch you ain't even got Japanese money
You fronted and that's the last you ever seen from me
Realized you  fiend from me
You can keep my shoes clean for me

I'm ballin', whatchu mean dummy bad bitch?
Tell her count the green for me, cabbage
Know I got the green on me
Living lavish, valet park it vie for me
Stupid
I'm from BK, everywhere that I go imma represent
And we blessed, this weed that i'm smoking is heaven sent
Never stress, I need me a billion, ain't get it yet

Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid
Rich The Kid up in Yonkers
Getting cheeseburgers chopped up
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid
In the hood who's your favorite?
Is it Madwiz or Jay Critch?
And try not to speak my name
Like Chris Benoit
But let me explain
Wiz and your , I can fly
Niggas is out of my range, in this game
And i stay forever
Shakes and pepper 'fore I break a record
Stay connected with my Haitian sector
Move you, I'm a high stepper
Wizard's world bitch

You know me and my niggas stay together
Hood fave, but I'm Jay forever
Little nigga, but I was by them OG's
With a gang, win her ass like a trophy
I'm in dubs, rolling dice with the homies
She a dubb, that bitch act like she know me
Fill the tub, got the water all on me
And I'm coming up, middle fingers to the police

I don't think nothing of it
Just dipped out of Publix's
Nothing but snacks in my luggage
I heard your new shit and it's rubbish
Ain't no slippin' force, we the authors
Catch a soundbombin' with the ruckus
In the spot looking morbid
Take a pill of the kush and absorb it
Learned a lot in the hood, I absorbed it
To the top, need a spot in the Forbes list
Purple cup, like I'm telling a fortune
Come and work for us, turn my niggas to bosses
And you had the juice but you lost it
New bag, good day at the office
I'm with Juice, all my niggas they flossin'
Diamonds move, got your shawty all nauseous

Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid
I get the chicken from Kum Kau
You niggas is looking real dumb now
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid
Now we just having a field day
Hill on my side, we call it the hills way
Dab, Datway

I'm smoking jattic on Biggie' block
Diamonds on me do the milly rock
No, we ain't talking to any cops
Watch how you walk and they sending shots
Put the hood on the map, fuck a next up
Put the hood on my back, no pressure
And I walk around the hills with the extras
Hit a jug put your trap on a stretcher

Black jag
Up in the spot with a black wag
Getting that money's the last laugh
Smoking jattic I don't pass that
Check it out
Jet magazine shit
Agony come mack with me and shit
Last seen with the fit
Mad muthafucking Wiz

I was on the ave with the nicks
Barclay's pull up with the tips
Ball gang, ballin' like the Knicks
All day, dreaming 'bout the chips
She can fuck me but can't get no tips
That hoe let me bust it, I'm all in her ribs
Boss up my life, had to handle my biz
Remember the nights we was runnin' from pigs

And you ain't never been on Waverly
So none of y'all niggas as brave as me
Murder lab, me and Juice bang
And Foot was street 730 gang
Together, Madwiz forever, Critch forever
Peace to Rich Forever
Shit we spit so get your shit together
Don't fuck with us unless your wrist is better

Stupid, shittin' me?
Stupid
Damn,
