You got a pull
I'm drawn like a magnet
Filling my skull
With beautiful madness
When you're in the room
I feel the static
Coming from you

There's something electric in our embrace
Bursting with power and energy
Shocked by the heat that we generate
Like an explosion I'm blown away

Like an explosion I'm blown away
Like an explosion I'm blown away
You might also like
We could get lost in the waves
The colorful boom that we make
There’s nothing but mist in the space
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

You got a pull
I’m drawn like a magnet
Filling my skull
With beautiful madness
When you're in the room
I feel the static
Coming from you

There's something electric in our embrace
Bursting with power and energy
Shocked by the heat that we generate
Like an explosion i'm blown away

Like an explosion I'm blown away

Our chemistry is terrifying
A mix of elements combined to react
Fusing your chemicals with mine
We're intertwining to create one big blast
Like an explosion I'm blown away

There's something electric in our embrace
Bursting with power and energy
Shocked by the heat that we generate
Like an explosion I’m blown
