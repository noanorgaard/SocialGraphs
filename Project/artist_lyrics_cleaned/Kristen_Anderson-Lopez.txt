But you and me
We, we know better

1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crowned together
Always be together, you and me

They say a princess is full of charm and grace
They say she always knows her place
They say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
They say she never laughs, and snorts milk out her nose
They say she's calm, they say she's kind
They say she never speaks her mind
Or freezes Nanny's big behind!

But you and me
We, we know better(Nanny: You girls are in so much trouble, when I tell your father...)
Anna: How come you can do that and I can't?
Elsa: I don't know. I wish you could though.
They say a princess is super duper sweet
She doesn't fight, she doesn't sweat, and you never see her eat
They say a princess doesn't climb and scrape her knee
They say a princess wouldn't freeze her tutor's tea
They say she poised, they say she's fair
She never mentions underwear!
Or longs to see the world out there...

But you and me
We...

Have big ideas of our own
For the distant someday when we're grown
When I'm queen (And I'm your right hand)
You'll get to travel throughout the land!
(I'll them of my sister, and the magic things she can do)
We'll take care of our people
And they will love me and you
No one can tell us what a princess should be
As long as we're together, you and 

But you’re you, you're you
And that's what makes me smile
You're you, you're you
So stay that way a while

Oh Hans I -

You don't have to say a thing I know the way you feel
Your face is like an open book, so honest, truе, and real
Other peoplе lie and cheat, when push may come to shove
Your heart doesn't work like that
So you're the girl I love

You’re you, you’re you
That's how I hope you stay
You’re you, you're you

But anyway
That's all I got to 

There'll be happy, similing people
It'll be totally strange
But, wow, am I so ready for this change

For the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forеver
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm еlated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

Tonight, imagine me, gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I gotta a chance

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know
But it's only for today (It's only for today)
It's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)
Tell the guards to open up the gate (The gate)

For the first time in forever
(Don't let them in, don't let them see)
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
(Be the good girl you always have to be)
A chance to change my lonely world (Conceal)
A chance to find true love
(Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know)
I know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever

All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
I was thinking the same thing!
Because, like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue...

But with you (But with you)
I found my place (I see your face)
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

Love is an open door
Love is an open door (Door)
Love is an open door
With you, with you
With you, with you
Love is an open door

I mean it's crazy (What?)
We finish each others'—
Sandwichеs!
That's what I was gonna say!
I've never mеt someone who thinks so much like me
Jinx. Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation
You and I were just meant to be!

Say goodbye (Say goodbye) to the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore

Life can be so much more

Love is an open door (Door)

Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something even crazier?


Life's too short

To be such an oblivious fool
So reckless that I couldn't see
Life's too short to be so desperate to be loved
That I only ever thought of me
I wish I saw things clearly
I guess I'm just not the sort
Now all I know
Is life's too shortYou might also 

This first attempt was more confrontational than what ultimately ended up in the movie, but we enjoyed going to that drama place

In this version, Anna's solution to the problem is for Elsa to put the gloves back on and this is a thing that really sets Elsa off
It's called "Life's Too Short"

I came all this way today to give us a fresh start
But now that you're like "wow"
It's all like warm in my heart

I'm so glad you like it, sis, 'cause this is the real me
You have no idea how great it feels to be free

We've been fallen out for way too long
So let's forget who's right

And forget who's wrong

Okay!

Why don't you stay?
There's room for family in my court

Cause life's too short

To always feel shut out and unloved
By the sister I long to know

Life's too short

To never let you celebrate me
The true queen of the ice and snow

Wo-ho-ho

I never (I never) understood (understood)
But now I do
Life's too short
To miss out on a sister like you
So you'll come back, then. 

Back?

To thaw the fjord, it's frozen over, no one can get in or out?

Oh

So...

Oh! I don't believe you!

What?! I just assumed that you would have to...

That I'll shove on the gloves?
That's how your story ends?

It does!
It's just like it was, except for we'll be best friends
So, that's in your plan, to force me back in a cage?

Whoa, whoa! Don't get upset
Let's get back on the same page

Gee, thanks for coming up to see the place
And showing off your mastery of tact and grace, Okay!
Run down the hill and spill my secrets
Make a full report!
Buh-bye!

Wait!

Cause life's too short

There it is!
The door you love to slam in my face!
You did well there for a spell
But now you're back in the same place
Kick me out if you want, but I'm the only one who
Is not one hundred percent convinced the prophecy's you!

You can think whatever you want 'cause I don't care
You're a fool who married a stranger!

That is so unfair!

I swear
I'm through with taking your unshaking sisterly support!
Support!
Support!
Ha! Life's too short!

To let you treat the people down there
Just as coldly as you always treated me

La la lalala lalala

Life's too short!

To listen to a reckless fool
Who only ever sees the things she wants to see

You don't know
You have no idea
What I've been through
Because of you
Life's too short to waste another minute
Life's too short to even have you in it
Life's too short
I've been so wrong about you
You?! You've been so wrong about everything
Maybe you are the prophecy!
I am NOT the
