Jimmy, oh, Jimmy, silly boy
Gee, what a real swell guy

Cut the cord, is that a man I once adored?
He's nothing but an albatross
No great loss, doublecrosser
Forget about the boy

Jimmy, oh, Jimmy, what great joy
He makes my troubles fly

Pull the plug, ain't he the one who pulled the rug?
He's lower than an alley cat, dirty rat
And I flatter

Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy!

Shout hooray and hallelu!
Now that me and mister wrong are through
I'll find myself another beau
Who I know is no rover
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy

Forget about the boy
(Forget about the boy)
And in the moonlight don't you think about him

Sister, you're much better off without him

You can blow the-

And put the sun back in the sky

For when he comes crawlin'

I'm not fallin'

Personal matters?

Not on company time! I didn't ask him to call; I don't want him to call! I never want to see Jimmy Smith again!

What we think is chic

Unique

And quite adorable

They think is odd and "Sodom and Gomorrah"-ble!

But the fact is
Everything today is thoroughly modern

Everything today makes yesterday slow

Better face reality

It's not insanity
Says Vanity Fair
In fact, it's stylish to

Raise your skirts and bob your hair
(Raise your skirts and bob your hair)

Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies

Isn't it delectable?

Painting lips and pencil lining your brows
Now is quite respectable

Goodbye, good goody girl
I'm changing and how
So beat the drums 'cause here comes
Thoroughly Modern Millie now
What we think is chic, unique and quite adorable
They think is odd and "Sodom and Gomorrah"-ble!
But the fact is
Everything today is thoroughly modern

Bands are getting jazzier

Everything today is starting to go

Cars are getting snazzier

Men say it's criminal what women'll do
What they're forgetting is

This is 1922!
Good-bye, good goody girl
I'm changing and how

I'm changing and how!

So beat the drums 'cause here comes thoroughly
Hot off the press! One step ahead! Jazz age!
Whoopee baby! We're so thoroughly modern

Millie!
