I need some fun vibes and a couple drops of sunshine
Good enough to pick and choose the always over sometimes
Pour a little out* we like to live a lot
And I make better decisions when I'm hot
We are chasing dreams for my scenes at my hangout spot
No plan for tonight
But we all stay locked
Writin nice ...
No thunder or lightning
Just a view of the ocean
And the sexy ass light skin girl
I'm going back
I'm going back
And I'm headed to my paradise
My paradise where I can sit and write songs
Eat a little food and we can share our lives
California got me thinking I should really take it easy
Out back with my crew and some girls if you need me
So when I say welcome home
You ask what do I mean
I mean you visit and you never wanna leave
Come find me
How do I get out of here?
Back to where I belong
California, California
Baby I'm coming home

It's so sweet so sweet Californ-i-a
With the fruit soft fall from my family tree
I need my skateboard a drink and a long stretch *of pavement
Pickin up my pace and I'm back to the basics
Yeah travel well of my element
Gone for a second and every time I leave
You know I'm always second guessing it
Thinking I'll regret it
But you know I'm coming back in the end
And i've accepted it
Yeah I'm feelin feelin all feelin all feelin all feelin all golden
We're skatin on the sidewalk
And you can hear us all hear us all hear us all hear us all rollin
It's so damn hot outside and miss flights are the only thing thats stoppin me from tryin to kick it tropically
Cuz out here we don't just own the sun, us California kids gotta monopoly
Let’s go come on

How do I get out of here?
Back to where I belong
California, California
Baby I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Cause I've been gone for way too long
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Cause I've been gone for way too long
And these Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls
Are all just so damn fine
And these Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls
Running through my mi-ind
And these Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls
Are all just so damn fine
And these Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls Cali girls
Running through my mi-i-i-ind
