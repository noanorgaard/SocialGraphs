Every time I see you girl my heart is inspired
Love is everything you're my only desire
I could do anything, even walk through the fire
'Cause you're my everything
And I just need you, to fight for love x2
To fight for love, to fight for love
(Verse 1)
The first time I met you girl
I felt like we were alone in the world
Sweet little girl, big brown curls
I wanna cover your body with diamonds and pearls
I can see in your eyes that you're having a crush
And this is so fantastic
Butterflies in my belly, first time
It feels just like magic
Let me give you my love
Place me number one in your heart above
Everything you had, before this love
Put it away and let's fly like a dove
I know we too young, but my feeling is too grown
All this time and now I feel like I've been waiting too long
This is the sweetest thing, the craziest thing I've ever said
Just because I'm in it this the best romance ever told

Every time I see you girl my heart is inspired
If love is everything you're my only desire
I could do anything, even walk through the fire
'Cause you're my everything
And I just need you, to fight for love
To fight for love, to fight for love x2
(Verse 2)
Saturday night, you and I
That's the way we like to do it
Go to the movies, together in the party
Show me how you dance on some good music
I can be the perfect lover
Everyday I send you flowers
Let give my French love
With some of this French kiss
Every time that I see you my heart boom
Like the beat and I lose my breath
I remember the first time you gave me that look
You smiled, and then, you left
I don't wanna be broken-hearted
I don't wanna lose my focus
I don't want you to disappear again
Just like hocus pocus
We were meant to be together
As this love was meant forever
I can give you my everything and I know
No one will love you better
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
Let me tell you this one time
Your body, your soul, your all, is mine
(Hook)
Every time I see you girl my heart is inspired
If love is everything you're my only desire
I could do anything, even walk through the fire
'Cause you're my everything
And I just need you, to fight for love
To fight for love, to fight for love
