Whoa whoa
I'm a little bit restless
Can't get you off of my mind
Oh

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
A little bit of you right now

Got my wheels pullin off that highway
My headlights pullin down your street
I got your song cranked up on the radio
But you ain't singing sittin next to me yeah
You might also like
Whoa whoa
Girl I need you now
Walk on out

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
Yeah

Oh I could use a little bit of your heart beat on mine
Your head on my chest all night long

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of
Your love
Your smile
That thing you do that drives me wild
Your kiss
Your touch
I could use a little
I could use a little bit of you right now
I wanna put my arms around the little bit of you right
