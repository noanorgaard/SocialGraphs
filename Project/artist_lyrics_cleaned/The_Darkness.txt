Touching you, touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now, we'll be rocking till the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh-ooh, huh!


I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin, but everything is a-okay

Touching you, touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me

I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now, we'll be rocking till the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh-ooh, guitar!

I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart
