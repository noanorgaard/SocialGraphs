We can go where we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry
I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't, nobody will
And you can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance
See Men Without Hats LiveGet tickets as low as $66You might also like
Safe to dance, well, it's safe to dance
Yes, it's safe to dance

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right
I say, we can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance

Oh well, it's safe to dance
Ah, yes, it's safe to dance
Oh well, it's safe to dance
Oh well, it's safe to dance
Oh, yes, it's safe to dance
Oh, it's safe to dance, yeah
Well, it's safe to dance
It's a safety dance
Oh, it's a safety dance
Oh, it's a safety dance
Oh, it's a safety dance
Oh, it's a safety
