Who’s lying next to me or how the hell that I got there
It’s hard to believe that’s how I used to roll
But one Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
I met her at the bar, it was right around last call
She stole my heart and I started down a new road
And when I’m holdin’ her
It’s like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing yeah that I feel
When she’s in my arms
No matter where we are
You know I’m right at home when I’m holdin’ her
On a park bench on 4th street I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand
Then a few short years later into the world
Came a six pound eight ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day I tell ya, I’ve been a brand new man
Oh when I’m holdin’ her
It’s like peace on earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing yeah that I feel
When she’s in my arms
No matter where we are
You know I’m at home when I’m holdin’ her
Yeah I’m right at home
Lord knows I’m right at home
Yeah I’m right at home when I’m holdin’ herSee Chris Janson LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also

I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

One Tuesday night, in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time, right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walkin' down a new road

And, oh, when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
And love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well, I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her

Now, on a park bench down on 4th Street, that's where I popped the question
And to my amazement, she actually said yes
Tears filled my eyes as I slipped a ring on her hand

Oh, then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day, let me tell you now, I became a brand new man
