You and me make clouds go 
And a poor  turning 
(Fucking microwave!)

Fucking microwave

You're painting yourself blue
There's nothing to do
Only watch ourselves grow
And avoid the undertow
Without them, I'm nothing
But a sad little boy
All of my friends, all of my cousins
They fill me with joy

"You are who you choose to be"
"Superman"You might also 

And I'm not home
And I'm not alone, but I'm over

The goosebumps spelled out in Braille on your back
All the times you said you quit
And all the times you fell back into
The same nasty habits affixed in your jaw
Call it chemistry, call it whatever you want
And all the people I loved yesterday and will love tomorrow
I love them the same today, so don't expect an apology

And you won't see it until it happens
And it won't see you until you're over it

So until then, happy Valentine's dayYou might also 

But that doesn't matter now
You're still plastered on my walls
And I just can't bring myself to cover you
With the bands that I don't even like at all

'Cause I'm a ghost in training, because my heart's been waning
Because of all the shit I've been eating
I know one day my heart'll stop beating
I'm sorry for everything I've done and said
I'm sorry for every tear that's dropped
I'm sorry for all the times you didn't get to drive me home

La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da

Well if you come inside, I promise to keep you warm
Sorry for scaring you for being the selfish fuck I know I amYou might also 

I wanna scoop out my cheeks
So you can't pinch them anymore
I want to add to my legs
Be as tall as the morgue
I want the fat in my arms to melt off my bones
And my stomach to fall out right onto the floorboard

Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you love but I hate
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you will never see again
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you love but I hate
Arms, legs, gut, face
Everything you will never see again
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you love but I hate
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you will never see again
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things that you love but I hate
Arms, leg, gut, face
All of the things you will never see again
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you will never see again
Arms, legs, gut, face
All of the things you will never see againYou might also
