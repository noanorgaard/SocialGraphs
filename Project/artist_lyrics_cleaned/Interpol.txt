She's bad
She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

She's bad
She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
Oh, she's bad

It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff

She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
