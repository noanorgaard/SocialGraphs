The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger? Yeah

No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone
The ride before the fall, yeah
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I've just got to have it all

I've seen your face a hundred times
Every day we've been apart

Yeah, you had me hypnotised, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming
