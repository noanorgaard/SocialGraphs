A real long time
Real long time
Out from my window please hear me Ohio
Your daughter wants to come home
She longs to be with you
To hug you to kiss you
To never leave her alone
She stands on the sidewalk just waving at taxi's
Like horses in parades in passing
I ask where she's headed she tells me "Ohio, I have seen my mother in ages"
It's been a long time
A real long time
Real long time
It's been a long time
A real long time
It's been a long time
A real long time
A real long time
Out from my window please hear me Ohio
Your daughter wants to come home
She longs to be with you
To hug you to kiss you
To never leave her alone
I've gotten to know her to live with to love her
It's hard to see her leave
She belong to her mother & the state of Ohio
I wish she belonged to me
