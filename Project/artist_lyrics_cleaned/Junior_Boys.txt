Sures and maybes
Better than a quick alright
Cause you're passing crazies
And you're feeling like you're living in a street fight
And we're bound to fall apart
Before it even starts
After everything I've read

And I'm digging up the earth
Now that I'm feeling sure
I lost that to the dirt
It won't be felt it won't be felt it won't be felt

The night is gone but you're afraid to go home

So come on back down town my love
It's better when you're around my love, no
Come on now

The night is gone but you're afraid to go home
The night is gone but you're afraid to go home
The night is gone but you're afraid to go home
(Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
The night is gone but you're afraid to go home
(But don't hurt me)
But you're afraid to go home
But you're afraid to go home
(I'm over it)
But you're afraid to go
