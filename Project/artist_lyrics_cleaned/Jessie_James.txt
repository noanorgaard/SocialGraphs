Hey, boy
I woulda thought that
When you left me, I'd be broken with my confidence gone
So gone
Hey, boy, I woulda thought that
When you said that you don't want me, I'd feel ugly
And sense something was wrong

Standing in front of the mirror
My skin's never been clearer
My smile's never been whiter

I look so good without you
Got me a new hairdo
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we're through
Done with your lies
Baby, now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye
I look so good
I look so good without you
I look so good
I look so good without you
You might also like
Hey, I never would of thought that
When you left me, I'd feel sexy and so good in my skin, again
And I never would of known that
I'd be dreamin' so much better without you in my head

Standing in front of the mirror
My clothes never fit better
My life's never been louder

I look so good without you
Got me a new hairdo
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we're through
Done with your lies
Baby, now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye
I look so good
I look so good without you
I look so good
I look so good without you

Now baby, my body's lookin' better than before (Better than before)
Ain't biting my nails since you walked out of the door
(You walked out of the door)
I realize now, I deserve so much more
Than what you give (Than what you give)
Than what you give
Than what you've given, oh
I look so good without you
Got me a new hairdo
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we're through
I look so good without you
Got me a new hairdo
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we're through
(Since you said that we're through)
Done with your lies
Baby, now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye
Without you (Goodbye)
Got me a new hairdo (Ooh-ooh, yeah)
Lookin' fresh and brand new
Since you said that we're through
Done with your lies
Baby, now my tears dry
You can see my brown eyes (Brown eyes)
Ever since you said goodbye

I look so good
I look so good without you
I look so good
I look so good without
