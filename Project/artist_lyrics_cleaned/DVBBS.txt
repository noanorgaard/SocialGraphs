Oh I've been dancin'
Own my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
Oh I've been dancin'
Own my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
You might also like
We're still up so late out
Deep down in the night
Even with the lights down
Tell me if you're looking out
I go all laserlights if you come around
Everything I do now
Tell me if you're out tonight

You know I'm up in the air, lonely firefly
I know oh, you're going somewhere
Don't, don't leave me there

Oh I've been dancin'
Own my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
Oh I've been dancin'
Own my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
I'm not going home
Oh I've been dancin'
Own my own, on my own
As long as you're looking
I don't feel alone
(i'm not going home)
This music just been
Goin' on, goin' on
But as long as you're looking
I'm not going
