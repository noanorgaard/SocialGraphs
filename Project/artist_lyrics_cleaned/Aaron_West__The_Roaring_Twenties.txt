You kept me waiting like the G Train
I held the door open for hours. I had to walk away
I rode the A line out to Rockaway
I’m always drawn to the water

Walked the streets to the shore
Passed by the murals fading off of the walls
Still licking the fresh wounds from a hurricane in the fall
And I watch them rebuild
I hummed a Ramone’s song out of key
Staring off at the skyline over shorebreak
And remembering that this same ocean almost killed me
South Carolina, seafoam green

On a calendar long enough, all my grief starts to decay
On a calendar long enough it grows more useless by the day
And I read that on a calendar long enough
New York will be returned to the sea
When the water gets high enough, it’ll take back everything
So the subway and the G Train
Our apartment, all our memories
Come to rest there under water
All the things that I thought meant the most to me
I try to picture it-- just the top of the skyline at low tide
Piercing the surface as the ships try to navigate their lanes
And there alone and triumphant on the crest of a wave
Is the couch you gave 

Well, I found a bar that's just outside the township line
And I go there most every night
I drank my last pay-check dry
And outside, a homeless man asks me for change and I…
I look him straight in his eyes, he starts to apologize

Tells me God's got a plan for me and that it'll be alright
Didn't know that I looked that pathetic
Didn't know that I looked that pathetic
Didn't know that I looked that pathetic

The owner's been giving me a break on my rent this week
He says that I'm good for it, well, I joke how I'm probably
But I came up short again and nobody's laughing
So I sneak out at 2 a.m., I can't do it honestly

Well, I know I'm a coward and I feel a bad night coming
Didn't know that I looked that pathetic

Didn't know that I looked that pathetic
Didn't know…

So pour me another drink for a daughter I'll never meet
A wife who don't love me and a cold cup of coffee
So pour me another drink and I'll count my blessings
Got a half tank of gas left and this bottle ain't
