Ooooooooooo
I wanna take my baby's shoes off
I wanna sing him a rock and roll
I wanna prove i've got it big
I wanna jump in the water
Take off all our clothes
I wanna walk down to the boulevard
I wanna buy a candy bar
I'm going to drink two martini
Jump in the fire
I'm gonna get burned
My baby ties me up in double knots
My baby ties me up in double knots
My baby ties me up in double knots
Hey, hey
He's gonna loosen me up
I'm gonna turn my baby's lights down
I'm gonna sing him a sizzlin' soul
I'm gonna prove i'm ready to fight now
Wanna jump in the water
Take off all our clothes

Hey, hey
