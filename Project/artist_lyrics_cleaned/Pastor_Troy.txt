Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if Heaven was Hell and vica versa? (yeah)
If I told you go to Hell, would you tell I cursed ya? (yeah)
I reimbursed ya with the truth so you know my fate (yeah)
And pray I die, I'm that nigga that they love to hate (yeah)
I wanna make you use your mind, God has sent the sign (yeah)
And when you listen to these rhymes, nigga, take your time (yeah)
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vica versa (yeah)
Would you start doing evil in order to nurture (yeah) the spirit man?
Do you understand that there's a war? (yeah)
It's ragin' on and the devil got some ammo too (yeah)
Don't get me wrong, but I put my trust off in the Lord (yeah)
It's too corrupt, know that God gon' help me blow 'em up (yeah)
I give a fuck, Heaven was Hell and vica versa (yeah), I have no fear
I done witnessed too much Hell right here (yeah), lend me your ear
Recall the beer we had to pour (yeah)
For all our niggas, hit the Devil with the .44 (yeah)
Payback, nigga!
My liquor keep me from tryin' to enter (yeah) battle alone
And to deal with all this wickedness, I smoke a zone
Know I'm grown, but I'm still a baby (yeah)
It's vica versa, so I guess I'll beg Satan to save me (yeah)
God I'm confused, the feuds of all these motherfuckers (yeah), makin' me sick
(*Virgin Mary never fucked nobody (yeah), but she suck dick*)
With a clique of nasty concubines (yeah)

I don't know where I'mma go this Christmas (yeah), it's Satan's birth
I'mma try to smoke a pound of weed (yeah), and ease the hurt
While Jesus equipped with angels, the Devil's equipped with Glocks
For God so loved the world that he blessed the thug with rocks
Won't stop until they feel me
"Protect me Devil, think the Lord is tryin' to kill me"
It's vice versa
Heaven is below, while this doja keep me high
To see the Lord Almighty nigga, I'm ready to die
My reply for any questions asked, "The Devil made me do it"
Who's the Devil may I ask? It's so polluted
Uprooted from all this stupid shit
See me cremated, my adaption to the climate
So glad I made it
Elated that they gon' go to Heaven
But do they know Heaven may not be the place to go?
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vica versa
The devil's in me and I'll be damned if I'm gon let God hurt ya
Follow me...

Heaven or Hell, where do we go
When we die: eternal fire or the streets of gold?
Only God knows, vica

Got me watchin for coppers, all I want is to prosper
Niggas climbing with me, don't know they claimin they "G"
So bump this beat cuz it's real, just change your air change the station
Watch the story bout hatin', then another bout bassin'
I'm takin' riches to get it, but now I'm sick of this shit
So with these last couple of dollars, we gone flip it legit
I bought this beat machine, bout big as a calculator
Who would have ever dreamed we hit the studio later
Its like I owe them bassers, for making me take this serious
Wasn't for the struggle cuz, you would not be hearin' this
In the mist I'm frisked bout three times a day
What I'm doing down here, nigga this where I stay
I just pray, that I relay, the message to some
And let them know, goddamn, ain't no more play where I'm from
