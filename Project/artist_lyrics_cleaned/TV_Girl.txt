I don't really know if she cares or not
All I know is she left a lot of stuff
In my apartment she's never getting back
As her smell off a pillow fades
Her cigarettes might stay
Like a Roman Coliseum
A dry and worthless monument to our love

Ooh, I still have your lighter
Ooh, I still have your book
Ooh, I still have everything you brought
But you never took
You know where to find me
And I know where to look
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm not a— not a crook-crook

And I don't really know if she knows or not
But I left some things in her jewelry box
And she's wearin' out my rings
Taking the compliments meant for me
And although I think I'll miss them
At least there's proof of my existence
A captive little soldier on her fingers
Deep behind enemy lines

Ooh, I still have your lighter

Ooh, I still have everything you brought

My copy of "Gravity's Rainbow"
That she probably didn't read
And how about my Laura Nyro record
She probably threw away when she moved?
And how about the half a box of lentils
From when I cooked her food that she probably didn't use?

I wanna dedicate this jam
To all those things I left behind in girls' apartments
And various domiciles over the years
Sometimes you gotta leave in a hurry, man, what can I say?
Except I didn't forget about any of it
Takin' it all back, one day
Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
That thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
That thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
That thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours,
