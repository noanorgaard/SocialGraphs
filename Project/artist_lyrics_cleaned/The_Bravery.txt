Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake, an honest mistake

Sometimes, I forget I'm still awake
I fuck up and say these things out loud

I must believe
There's more above us and below
I must believe
Stranded with this bitch called hope
It keeps me here
When all I wanna do is go
It keeps me here
When all I wanna do is disappear

If this is it, all we have and ever will
If this is it, time is running out and standing still
I'll leave today
'Cause there's nothing left to keep me here
I'll fade away
I'll turn my back and disappear

The city moves
Lunges up right from the ground
The seething Earth
It opens up and spits us out
This vicious child
Nature never wanted us

If this is it, time is running out and standing still
I'll leave today
'Cause there's nothing left to keep me here
I'll fade away
I'll turn my back and disappear

Sometimes I feel like I wanna leave this place for good
Under the ground
I'll live down there without a sound
And never hear
These hissing voices all the same
I'll disappear
'Cause living makes me feel ashamed
If this is it, all we have and ever will
If this is it, time is running out and standing still
I'll leave today
'Cause there's nothing left to keep me here
I'll fade away

Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If I could do it all again
I'd go back and change everything but
Time won't let me go

I never had a "Summer of '69"
Never had a Cherry Valence of my own
All these precious moments
You promised me would come in time
So where was I when I missed mine?

Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If you gave me back those years
I'd do it all better I swear
Time won't let me go

Not even Earth could hold us
Not even life controls us

I can keep secrets that I know how you want me
You could dig your nails into my skin and you won't stop me
You could twist and scream into the air but no one can hear you here

And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness
There will be no tenderness, no tenderness
I will show no mercy for you
You had no mercy for me
The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly

While your shouting friends that despise you to your face
What would they say now if they saw you in this place?
Naked and breathless, could you live with this disgrace?
Could you live? Could you live? Could you live with this?

And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness
There will be no tenderness, no tenderness
I will show no mercy for you
You had no mercy for me
The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly

There's a smell of stale fear that's reeking from our skins
And the drinking never stops because the drinks absolve our sins
We sit and grow our roots into the floor
But what are we waitin' for?
What are we waitin' for?

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

Something's always coming, you can hear it in the ground
It swells into the air with the rising, rising sound
And never comes, but shakes the boards and rattles all the doors
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
