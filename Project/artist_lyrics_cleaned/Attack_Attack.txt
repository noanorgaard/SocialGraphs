Apathy has its hold on me

Lonely, I feel so lonely
Girl hold me, won't you just hold me
Lonely, I feel so lonely
Girl hold me, won't you just hold me

It has taken me seven days
To realize that my time has come
And I never knew that I was gonna be the one to blame
Why is this taking me so long?
Girl, you know I don't want to be alone
(you know I'll never find another like you)
So girl, you know I don't want to be alone
(you know I'll never love another like you)

"Oh my 

I'll fight this war alone
If that's what it takes to get home to you
I'll fight this war alone

I've lost control again and the night is closing in
How do I keep my feet on the floor, when I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
Cause I have you to come home to

Take a step back and finally think for yourself
You're living a life full of lying
I'm over this process of letting my life be run by your desire

I'll fight this war alone
'Cause that's what it takes to come home to you
I'll fight this war alone

('Cause I have you to come home to.)
('Cause I have you to come home to.)

I'm never gonna give up hope
I'm never gonna give up hope
I'm never gonna give up hope
I'll never give up until I'm dead
And if you want me too, you'll have to take my life

I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war alone
I'll fight this war
