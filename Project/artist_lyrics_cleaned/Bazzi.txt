Hit it from the back and drive you wild (Yeah-yeah)
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes (Haha)
I just had to let you know you're mine (Mine)

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time (Time)
Feels like forever, even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me, you're mine
I can't look away, I just gotta say

Girl, anything I can do just to make you feel alright? Uh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy, all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man, this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride
You're mine (Mine, oh-uh-oh)
