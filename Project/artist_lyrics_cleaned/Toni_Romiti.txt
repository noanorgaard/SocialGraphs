You did it so easily
You broke my heart, you left me scarred like I never meant a thing

At first you wasn't my type
But then I learned you was just what I liked
There wasn't a day when you weren't on my mind
But now it seems like you just changed overnight
Changed up like I change clothes
You changed up for them lame hoes
You asking me to stick around like what the fuck would I stay for
I won't be no lame for you
Never catch me chasing you
If you wanna fuck with them stupid hoes
Well guess what, I'm not saving you
They gon' take your bread, your peace of mind, and your sanity
When I spread my legs for someone else don't be mad at me
'Cause you had your chance, too bad, too sad
Got a new bitch, well guess what, she's not as bad as me
And I know for a fact that she can't throw it back like me
And I know for a fact that she can't throw a rack like me
I can't believe you would do me like that
How he switched up man I will never understand

Ayy chill out, wasn't no switch up
It was called a mix up
Sometimes when you think it's a switch up
It's a thirsty individual ready to mix up
I mixed up, damn
It all started, we was at the party
I was off the Henn, I was going retarded
She was dancing on me and she got me started like ooh-wee
And I took her home, she started fucking on me
Started sucking on me, started rubbing on me
And I swear to god, ooh we made a movie
She was 'bout her money, she was bout her cash like blue cheese when the rain come and the storm fall that's looseleaf
How the fuck did I switch up?
You was on the side like pick-up
Now I'm at your throat like hiccup
You tryna play it cool but you gon' miss us
Let me tell the truth, let me fix us
She was thick as fuck and I failed
I was wrong as fuck and you can tell
I can't get you out my mind
All that I'm asking can you give me one more time
I gotta get what's mine, I gotta get what's mine
