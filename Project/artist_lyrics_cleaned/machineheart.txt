Oh, when I'm runnin' low
Oh, when the river's dry
Oh, can you help me go on?

One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle
You might also like
Oh, I know this is heavy
Like a weight on your back
But I think that we can carry
Carry on 'til the last
And we're laughing and crying oceans
At the smallest of things
But it feels so much better
When we find the release

Oh, like a broken light
Oh, in the blackest night
Oh, can you flip the switch on?

One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
And it's never in the knowing
It's in the not giving in
And when the earth is slippin', trippin'
Right underneath our feet
Remember we're not finished
We're not finished
I don't know where I'm going (Oh, when I'm runnin' low)
But I know where I've been (Oh, when the river's dry)
And it's never in the knowing (Oh, when I'm runnin' low)
It's in the not giving in (Oh, when the river's dry)
And when the earth is slippin', trippin' (Oh, when I'm runnin' low)
Right underneath our feet (Oh, when the river's dry)
Remember we're not finished (Oh, when I'm runnin' low)
We're not finished (Oh)

One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle
Pull me in a circle, circle, circle

One more time
We're gonna get up for this
We're never gonna run and hide
If I get tired and say that I wanna
Change my mind
Pull me in a circle so I can change it
One more time
Pull me in a circle,
