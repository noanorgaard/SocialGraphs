I got the windows down
No one else around, singing

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along
To my backroad song

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I hit the brakes for an old New Holland
Hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut

I got the windows down
Way out of town, singing

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along

The only way today could get better
Girl, what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck

I wake up, put a dip in, crack a cold one
Put my boots and my overalls on
This is the country boy song
I like to gig frogs
Like to gut hogs
Like to swim in the creek with my bird dog, uh huh
This is the country boy song

Chew it up, spit it out
Crack a cold one and tilt it back
I'm tired of these city boys runnin' their mouths
If their truck gets stuck I ain't pullin' them out
If you got a dip in your lip help me sing along
This is the country boy song

I catch bass and cats
With a rod and reel
Kill bucks from atop of a windmill all day long
This is the country boy song
I fix the tree, widdle sticks
My barbwire tattoo gets me chicks, uh huh
Of course it goes all the way around

I keep a twelve guage by my water bed
Cause the next trailer over lives a meth head, uh huh
And that ain't biscuits he's cookin'
Yeah, I'm a redneck, I'm white trash
Quarter Cherokee blood from my mom's half, uh huh
This is the country boy song

Chew it up, spit it out
Crack a cold one and tilt it back
I'm tired of these city boys runnin' their mouths
If their truck gets stuck I ain't pullin' them out
If you got a dip in your lip help me sing along
This is the country boy song

The night is young imma gonna get messed up

The night is young imma gonna get messed up
Gettin' country drunk in the back of my truck
