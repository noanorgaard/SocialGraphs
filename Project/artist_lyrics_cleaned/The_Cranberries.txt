I know I've felt like this before
But now I'm feelin' it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person fallin' here is me
A different way to be

Ah
La-ah-ya-ah
La-ya-ya
La-ah-ya-ah
Ya-ah, ah, ah

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
And they'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

And now I tell you openly
You have my heart, so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
Totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh, my life
Is changin' every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me

Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah 

Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
'Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me?
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know?
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
'Cause we were raised
To see life as fodder and take it if we can

My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

And I miss you, I miss
'Cause I liked it
'Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know?
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
'Cause we were raised
To see life as fodder and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?

Du-dudu-du-du-dudu-du

If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart, it's ruinin' everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand?
Were you lyin' all the time? Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused, and I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?


And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it 

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ya-ya
