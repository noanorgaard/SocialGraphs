If this is the only life we've been given
Then maybe you and I should just live it, live it

We could be goin' nowhere
It could be heaven right here, right on my knees
We could see what comes next, but there's no need
Darling just stop and drop, 'cause it feels alright to me

If we keep movin' on, boulevards will never stop
We'll be further along but not any closer
When we're two steps ahead we'll never see what's coming next
Now we're missing cards... 'cause we lost the hearts

If this is the only life we've been given
Then maybe you and I should just live it, live it

Up at night, I'm awake 'cause it haunts me
That I never got to say what I wanted
Oh my God, oh my God
I’m not the same as I was with you
I would jump out my skin just to get you
Oh my God, oh my God

How could you have ever known
If I never let it show?
Now I just wanna know, are you?
Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine

Your silhouette is burned in my memory
Rubble left from the moment that you left me
Oh my God, oh my God
And three words have never come easy
'Cause you're more than they ever could be
Oh my God, oh my God

It's hard to see beyond what's in sight
But when you tilt the light I realize

For 1000 nights
I've been a restless soul
Just wasting time
Digging up fool's gold
It took a 1000 lives
Being on my own
For me to find
It was all fool's gold

I've felt the fever on
But couldn't taste the fruit
There's a bulletproof-bond
Between meaning and you

It's hard to see beyond what's in sight
But when you tilt the light I realize

I've been a restless soul
Just wasting time
Digging up fool's gold

I see 'em coming 'round the bend
For me again
Riding for my soul across the creek
Oh yeah
I hear the hounds call

Going back between my eyes
True grit lies inside my mind
Leaving awake in the moonlight and
Dust trees, I'm outta sight

I'm going, going, going back home
Only face I know is the face I see
Only place I know is inside of me
Home, home, home in me

And I hope the swamps they push me towards
Lies the road of the almost won
I put my heels down and I steady my course
I push on 'cause there's so much noise
Gotta outrun what's chasing me

Trouble's coming down again
We said, trouble's coming around the bend

Only place I know is inside of me
Home, home, home in me
