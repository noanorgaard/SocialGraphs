And I'll dream you up in this vast, dark bed
Believe I loved you for each hair upon
The back of your neck and I
Want to kiss you but I can't
Down on the river by the sugar plant
Down on the river by the sugar plant

Earrings
Weighing down the lobe and
Nose a lovely slope and the mouth turned down
Shoulders
Pale and beautiful and
Angle of the throat and
Your sweet sad stare

All of the waves that crash upon the shore
Fruitlessly shushing the world
I pledge allegiance to my displacement
My flag of doubt is unfurled
You might also like
And I'll dream you up on a vast, dark coast
Believe I see you walking toward me, arms outstretched like a ghost, and I
Want to kiss you but I can't
Down on the river by the sugar plant
Down on the river by the sugar plant

Down on the river by the sugar plant
Down on the river by the sugar plant
Down on the river by the sugar plant
Down on the river by the sugar
