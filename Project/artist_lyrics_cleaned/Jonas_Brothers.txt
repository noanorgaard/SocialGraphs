Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter

And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under

'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too
