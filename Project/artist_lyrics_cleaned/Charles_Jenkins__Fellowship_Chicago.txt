Might as well put your hands together
Put 'em together, come on
Put 'em together

I got joy in my soul
God is in control
I got Satan on my trail
But I'm singin' all is well
He's attackin' everyday
But I'm watchin' while I pray

No matter the attack
I won't turn back

'Cause this means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This means war
Put 'em together

I got joy in my soul
God is in control
I got Satan on my trail
But I'm singin' all is well
He's attackin' everyday
But I'm watchin' while I pray
You might also like
No matter the attack
I won't turn back

'Cause this means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This mеans war
I plead the blood

I plead, I plеad the blood (There's power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Healin' in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood

I've been in the storm and the rain
But the blood still stays the same
Whatever's goin' wrong
My war clothes are on
I might be in a daze
But you can't have my praise

No matter the attack
I won't turn back
'Cause this means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This means war
(This means) This means war
I plead the blood

I plead, I plead the blood (There's power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Healin' in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood

You can't have my family
You can't have my increase
You can't have my breakthrough
You can't have my, you can't have my
You can't, you can't, you can't, I plead

I plead, I plead the blood (There's power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (It's a prayer protection)
I plead, I plead the blood (It's a prayer prevention)
I plead, I plead the blood (This means)
This means war
(There's power in your praise) This means war
(That changes thing) This means war
(You can't take this lyin' down) This means war
(Said this means) This means war
This means war
Five, six, seven, eight


Come on, put your hands together

Say you can't have my family
Say you can't have my increase
Breakthrough, you can't have my breakthrough
You say, you can't have my, you can't have my
You can't, you can't, you can't, I plead

I plead, I plead the blood (There's power in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Healin' in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Deliverance in the blood)
I plead, I plead the blood (Here's what you gotta say, this means)

This means war
(Whenever the enemy's attackin' in your life, you gotta say)
This means war
(You can't be breakin' down and fallin' out)
This means war
(You gon' break out your prayer, break out your words)
This means war
(You gon' break out some praise)
This means war
(Last time) This means war

Will somebody clap your hands? It's alright
That's all you got? That's all you got?
That's all you
