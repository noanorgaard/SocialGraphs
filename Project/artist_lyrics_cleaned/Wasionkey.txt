Do you trust me, oh
Do you trust me?
Do you love me, oh
Yeah, you love me
Yeah, you know me, yeah
You know what I need
What I do, I broke your trust in me
Truth is, truth is...

I've done my dirt, I've done my fair share of running
I know my words, right now they don't mean nothing
I put you on the back burner
To get you back, girl I'll earn ya
This life right after the turn up
That other thing didn't work

If it ain't you, then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, make sure they know that it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, make sure they know that it ain't no...

What do I gotta say
Fuck an apology, girl you're a part of me
The biggest part of me I would say
You were the start of me
You'll be the end of me
Truth is, this shits from an honest place
Wish that I did that more often
Wish I wasn't lost, wish I wasn't so cowardly
Wish I was saying this to your face

For what it's worth
Just know ain't one bitch on this earth
Can't take me from you
You come first
Come take this from me
You come first
Truth is, truth is...

I've done my dirt, I've done my fair share of running
I know my words, right now they don't mean nothing
I put you on the back burner
To get you back, girl I'll earn ya
This life right after the turn up
That other thing didn't work
If it ain't you, then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, make sure they know that it ain't nobody
If it ain't you then it ain't nobody
If it ain't you, make sure they know that it ain't
