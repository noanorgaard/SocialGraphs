Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor

El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo

And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby, yeah)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Come on)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy, yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you,
