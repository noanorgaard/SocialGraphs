Was it the whiskey or the rain
The night when we lost our brains
Or when I tried to form words
And turn them into phrases

When we were kids we were wolves
Just howling at the same moon
Our feet hung from the ground
Over green leaves and dirt
The cars turned to lights
As we rationed our youth

I was the king of my heart heavy days
I woke up my wolves and I gathered my faith
I've got my pride and that's all I can blame
If you try to taste my brother's blood
You'll get the worst of me

We walked trhough the blur
And screamed at the veins of earth
We caught ourselves fading
In dark wooden rooms
I told you life was beautiful
I told you what it meant to me
You might also like
I was the king of my heart heavy days
I woke up my wolves and I gathered my faith
I've got my pride and that's all I can blame
If you try to taste my brother's blood
You'll get the worst of me


Wait boy it's only cause you're dreaming
Sedate boy oh let it out
Remember what they're waiting for
You've got a sensible pride
Now use it right

I was the king of my heart heavy days
I woke up my wolves and I gathered my faith
I've got my pride and that's all I can blame
If you try to taste my brother's blood
You'll get the worst of me
You'll get the worst of
