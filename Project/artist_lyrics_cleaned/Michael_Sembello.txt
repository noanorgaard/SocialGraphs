It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
You might also like
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Ooh, oh
Oh


It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac at your door (At your door)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door (Maniac)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac at your door (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And she's dancing like she's never danced
