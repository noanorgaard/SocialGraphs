Van Jams:
Are you half empty?
Why don't you fill up?
There's no sense in holding
Onto something broken
Did you lose something?
Or someone you love?
You've still got that story
Tell it every morning

Driving down a road, down a road that's stolen
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Driving down a road, down a road that's hidden
All the faithful memories of faithful living
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
So come on!

Nothing is perfect
For that there's no cure
So don't you start to bury
The good with the bad and the ugly

Driving down a road, down a road that's stolen
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Driving down a road, down a road that's hidden
All the faithful memories of faithful living
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
So come on!

And I can feel your heartbeat slipping away
It's hard to catch the light
When you're running from the day
So wait for it, wait for it, wait

Driving down a road, down a road that's stolen
All the lovely memories your heart's been holding
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Driving down a road, down a road that's hidden
All the faithful memories of faithful living
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
Nothing silhouettes 'til the lights come on
So come 

Lately, what's the problem?
What's the headline, this time?
Somehow, we're okay with
All these differences leaving us blind, blind, blind

I'm not scared of fighting
I'm just a little bit over this conversation
I'm not tryna hide it
I'm just thinking slowly
Maybe you and I could live
Together if we ever learn to ease the tension
Maybe the world isn't crazy
Maybe it's you and I, I, I

I found the truth in the distance
I heard the words in the wind
And on it goes like wildfire, it's spreading
From past lives to the living
Who's changing the people or time, time, times?

Lost with a cause
Someone wrote down on a paper
That defines all the lines that we draw
But we don't understand what's unstable
Maybe we're all lonely and afraid
Maybe we're all trying to find the words to say
Maybe we just need love (Give me some)
Love (Give me some)
Love (Give me some)
Love

Maybe you and I could live
Together if we ever learn to ease the tension
Maybe the world isn't crazy, no
(Maybe it's you and I)
Maybe the world isn't crazy, oh no
(Maybe it's you and I)
I said, maybe the world isn't crazy
Maybe it's you and I, I,
