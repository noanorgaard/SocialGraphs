You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right, until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong
You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right, until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong

I tell her, let's get away
We can find the place where
Nobody judge us and baby, I can take you there
Up in the sky, free falling from the clouds
I ain't never been this high
But I ain't coming down, Look
Cold world
Everyone's a critic
And that new girl
She ain't like them other women
She love them country side
She ain't used to the city
She just wants to talk, She just wants to kick it
And she reaching for the stars
Even though she knows its distant
Like shes reaching for my heart
Even though she knows it's missing
She ain't looking for commitment
She's just looking for herself
In the kitchen, she alive
And she made it through hell
Burning blunts after blunts
Burning ounces
Looking for the love
But she still ain't found it
I know we in the game
But we both out of bounds
I take a shot for you
And it's round after round
You might also like
You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right, until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong
You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong

Pack your bag ride along lets let's get away
Don't need this beat
Just listen to what I gotta say
I'm not perfect
I know i made a lot of mistakes
Just take my hand
I'm taking you to a better place
A better place
A better way
For you and I
Hop on this plane
We in the sky
What's on your mind
Give me your faith
Give me your hand
Look in my eyes
Until I'm gone
My love for you will never die
You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right, until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong
You'll never love a
Good girl until she's
Gone
You'll never know
What's right until you
Treat her wrong
Until you can't touch what you're reaching for
And every breakup got a singalong

Blunt after blunt after blunt
A bottle to the face and i still ain't drunk
These one night stands they ain't been all that fun
Cause even when I'm sober
I know you the one
Blunt after blunt after blunt
A bottle to the face and i still ain't drunk
These one night stands they ain't been all that fun
Cause even when I'm sober
I know you the
