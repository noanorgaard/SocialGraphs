One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says, "Son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style"
And from behind my coffee cup, I just smile

What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in

This morning, put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm losing my mind, I swear
It might be the death of me, but I don't care

I'd start walkin' your way, you'd start walkin' mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground, 'cause we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
Standin' in the backyard, remindin' me and you
That if we don't see eye to eye, there's somethin' we can do

I'd start walkin' your way, you'd start walkin' mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground, 'cause we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

Babe, I love the way we work it out
That's what love is all about
