Near the countryside but I just forgot
All the things that matter I forget a lot
I get so caught up in the city cloud
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run, take me to the bus
But don't let me go, no, don't let me on
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
But yeah, you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

There's something in the way you do, there's something in the way you
Push me closer, further, break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true, there's nothing left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart

I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favorite ride, ooh
Hey, oh

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart
You might also like
Oh, and then you see, ooh

I've figured out that joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars, watch me fall apart

Ooh, hey
Ooh, oh
Yeah, oh
Hey, 

And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight

In the canyon, underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen

And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this now, everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Wanna hear your beating heart 

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand

Sayin' that I hurt you, but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could've really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
It's a shame (Shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth

'Cause we both have the fear, fear of bein' alone

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows I'm not dying, but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see as you steal my soul from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do

Anything could happen, anything could happen

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside, the cars speed by
I'd never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it has always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
