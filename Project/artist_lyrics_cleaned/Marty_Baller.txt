Uh, wonder why these niggas all mad at me
(Wonder why these niggas all mad at me)
I put in the work and I came from the streets
(I put in the work and I came from the streets)
I was so hungry I had to go eat
(I was so hungry I had to go eat)
Now when I smile I got racks on my teeth
(Yeah)

Shootin in back of the jeep
Case niggas actin on me
I got the jacket on me
Dab me a ratchet on me
So don't step in my face
Unless you want to get these writs
I on my way down to the bank
To put my money in the safe
Last year being broke, first year being rich
In the city like I'm big
You can find out where I live
New house new crib
Late up eatin' ribs
Hennessy in the Fridge

I was so hungry I had to go eat
Now when I smile I got racks on my teeth

I want a plug that flows
I want to ride in a Porsche
