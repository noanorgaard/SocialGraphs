Another one for a cigarette
Take a look at this place
Sunglasses, panties and radio set
It´s going easy with
A good radio set
It´s going easy with
Paceville doesn´t sleep
The sun appeared two hours ago
With her street full of kids
Who cares they just get, get out of below
It´s never easy when
You get out of below
It´s never easy when
We´re gonna wake up as friends
Wake up as friends
We´re gonna wake up as friends
Wake up as friends

Even if i have to go, wohoho
Even if i have to go, wohoho
Even if i have to go, wohoho
Even if i have to go, wohoho
Woh oh oh oh oh oh

Another one for saying goodbye
Golden bay´s my new bed
Sunburnt women, easy on the eye
It´s going easy when
You´re easy on the eye

Wake up as friends
We´re gonna wake up as friends
Wake up as friends
