And then I see your face
In every place that I go
That I go
You're makin' noise, you're makin' noise
And I wish-sh-sh-sh-shudderin' shaking in my shoes
Oh no, and I know
And now we're juh-juh-just standin' there with nothing else to lose

And I'm askin' and I'm pleadin' and I'm holdin' your hand
You're telling me these things that I can't understand
And I'm askin' and I'm pleadin' and I'm holdin' your hand
You're telling me these things that I can't understand

I had to watch you fall
A reason to stall
A phone I'd call, babe, you know I would
You know I would

And I'm askin' and I'm pleadin' and I'm holdin' your hand
You're telling me these things that I can't understand
And I'm askin' and I'm pleadin' and I'm holdin' your hand
You're telling me these things that I can't understand
No, I can't
No, I 

Beautiful girl
Hasn't grown up yet
And she's wasting all her feelings on
A boy she's never met
Says that she is happy but
Is she lying?

Running and she's running again
She's trying to understand but she can't
Running and she's running again
She's crying by herself 'cause she can

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you?
You might also like
Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
It's the middle of the night
And nobody makes a sound
Says that she can do it but
Is she lying?

Running and she's running again
She's trying to understand but she can't
Running and she's running again
She's crying by herself 'cause she can

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her?
The way that she loved you

And would you be there?
To help her push on through
And would you know her?
If she didn't know you
Are we eno-ough?
Do we measure up?
Are we enough?
Do we measure up?

Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
Oh she's such a pretty face

Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you?
And would you be there?
To help her push on through
And would you know her?
If she didn't know you

Wo-o-oah
Wo-o-o-o-oah
Wo-o-oah
