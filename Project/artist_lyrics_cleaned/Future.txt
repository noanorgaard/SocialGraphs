They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy

I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery
Fully loaded whip tote fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

1 ContributorWrong LyricsThe penultimate song on the mixtape “For Those Who Don’t Know”.
This cut showcases a sense of defiance and confidence in my abilities, while at the same time detailing my inner thoughts on said abilities… Read More Instrumental: F*ck Up Some Commas by Future
 x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

I’m feeling so offbeat
Every step expecting to drop
Knees down to the floor
And the ground couldn’t stop these thoughts
If I fell face flat/ can’t fail/ hate that
I’m back up on my feet that’s not me
Run back to my comfort zone but I refuse to quit
‘Cause I’m cool with this
Take all my flaws/ make music with
I don’t know how these standard emcees
Are reaching a point where they’re setting these standards
Oh well/ hands off their coattails
Eyes on your prize/ don’t gloat when your foes fail
‘Cause it’s not about them
It’s all about you
Don’t jump all smug at the front
And emerge as a prick
Keep going/ ignore what they say
Then do it like Jay and just fuck up the world like…

Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard

Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

Feel like I’m overly critical
Show it through poems and flow like I’m lyrical
Fact is I map this anger out to a banger
And attack anyone who’s coming my way
Like I’m doing right now
Everything I write down
Know it’s so typical
Stone cold cynical
Hope so miniscule
Feel so lost but I feel so invincible
Feel I can do it my way
Thinking every minute
“KD, why wait?”
Know I’ve got a talent but I’m still unsure
But that’s life in a cold world
Just love yours; I tell myself
But still fail to accept any help
I feel like I’m doing it wrong
The newer the song
The better I feel
But never reveal
How I feel when I see they’re all moving along
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

Fuck this
Frustrated, everything is too much
And I erupt in a rage/ can’t function
Doused in a ‘bout of confusion and numbness
Why do I care what the fuck you want?
I’m doing my thing so fuck you mugs
Can’t dumb down when the gloves come off
I don’t care, either way, you’re getting punched up bruv
Emcees throw a dismal punch
Can’t spit/ no pistol when fists go up
So they talk slick/ tweet with their lips all shut
Hidden when the villains let their pitbulls run
Sniffing out their minimal ability
And kill ‘em within minutes of revealing where they stay
Finish them/ it’s vicious/ unh
Spit all I envision in my inner chamber
Door’s locked/ no entry
I enter only when I vent I know me
I need that fuel and I ignore the danger
I go to God when I feel deranged
And I feel that anger and I can’t contain it
I slowly feel I might go insane
‘Cause I’m running in circles inside my brain
It’s just madness/ climaxing
A hyperactive overload of life and passion so
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine

I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and the fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up ten thousand ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

Kissin' on the water with my chains out
My life is more effective than a cocaine drought

I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy

The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
