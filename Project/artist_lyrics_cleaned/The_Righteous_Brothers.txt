But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize
Little things I do

It makes me just feel like crying (Baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea, yeah
Lonely rivers sigh
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Woah, my love, my darling
I've hungered, hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
