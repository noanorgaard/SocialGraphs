Now it's raining over here
It's pouring down
(pouring down baby)
Oh girl, oh girl your body's soaking wet
We bout to drown
(lets go)

Cause all I want is you, you, you, you
Ain't no telling what we gon, gon, gon, do
Cause oh my you too sexy
Your body's a blessing
I just wanna lay you down
(lay you down)

There's no need to slow down
Ain't no need to rush
(There's no need to slow down
Ain't no need to rush)
Girl all I need is you, you, you
(Yeah)
(Is it the sound of my voice)
(Play you on the floor got me working 'cause I know you want more)
(That you miss so much)

Oh baby I want more
All I see is you
All I see is you

Nobody else but you girl, nobody else but you girl
All I see is you

Nobody else but you girl, nobody else but you girl
(Nobody)

Play you on the floor got me working cause I know you want more
Until you can't take it babe
Cause I want your lovin babe

I just wanna get next to you
I just wanna get a taste of you
Taking you down
Fking around and I don't mean trying to have sex with you
Doing things that your lovers do
I can tell by that by the way you move
These girls they keep calling my phone won't stop ringing
I don't really care cause I'm into you
We can be lovers and friends
Imma lay you down
Imma lay you down
Imma lay you down
We can be lovers and friends, yeah

Imma lay you down
Imma lay you down

There's no need to slow down
Ain't no need to rush
(There's no need to slow down
Ain't no need to rush)
Girl all I need is you, you, you
(Yeah)
(I know you can hear me babe)
I know you can hear me babe
I know you can hear me babe
(Miss me right?)
Oh baby I want more

Nobody else but you girl, nobody else but you girl
