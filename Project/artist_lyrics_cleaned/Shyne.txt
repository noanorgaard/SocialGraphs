A hundred carats in the watch (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Gettin skull off in the parkin lot (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Bailin out when you locked (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Takin over spots and blocks (THAT'S GANGSTA)

I got a question; as serious as cancer:
"Where da fuckin safe at?" Somebody better answer
Before I start peeling and feeling these double-aught slugs
In your mug; leave you spittin up blood
Got dead gangstas rollin over like, "Yo this nigga cold"
The way he cut his coke is murder game to his flow
Rich is, my only reason for bein'; shit
I never had hope, until I sold dope
Drug game is infectious, got me livin' reckless
Feds get uptight when they see my watch and necklace
Glow, fuck 'em, they can't catch me
Murder and money, 'til they throw my ashes in the sea

Mac-10's, crush rocks and drops
The best respect, the feds only fuck cops
Coke price raisin, task force raidin
Bustin at secret agents runnin up out the Days Inn
Roller, diamonds and mack-milla's
Fillers and loud pipes for all my killers
Money hungry honies around, the killer streets and the law
The opium and the raw, that's what I live for
For cuttin yay, never for today
Extended magazines shootouts and ricochets
Play a role and catch a bullethole, pop your blood vessels
Ain't gonna wait before the smoke settles

{*scratching "Serious shit"*}

Money in brown paper bags (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Servin fiends on the ave (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Menage red labels (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Honies with diamonds up in they navel (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Showin love to your hood (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Leavin cowards layin where they stood (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Floodin your homey's commisary up (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Never missin when we bust (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Money in brown paper bags (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Servin fiends on the ave (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Menage red labels (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Honies with diamonds up in they navel (THAT'S GANGSTA)
Showin love to your hood (THAT'S GANGSTA)

On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce, is not for ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus

We gettin clo-ser, my player days is o-ver
Well maybe not completely
But still and all, come here, rest ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
Like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks
Pour Cristal over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh

On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce

 & (Barrington Levy)
We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Chow's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Chandon
Just a bottle of Avian; c'mon, uh

On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce

Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus
So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa
Cause you I love, and not another
Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'mma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii
Always be there - for me
Always be there
Be there for me
Ohhhhhhhhh, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah
Ohhhhhhhhh
For me, for
