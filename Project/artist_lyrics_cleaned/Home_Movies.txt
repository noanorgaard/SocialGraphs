Shiloh here
Since we've transitioned to Grade Ten FM, it's just been different
I've been sensing a fucking attitude from you guys
And I don't appreciate that shit
I know I'm not supposed to swear on the radio, but fuck!
How old are you guys now, hmm? Fifteen, sixteen?
Grow the fuck up! There, I said it
It's been driving my ass nuts trying to stay sane in here
It's fucking batshit, bro!
I'll leave if y'all want me to, I'm serious
This is pissing me the fuck off
Grow the fuck up, calm the fuck down, and I'll do the same
Goodbye, and good riddance to the hoes that are leaving
Fucking hell


Home movies are all I have left of ya
It's like archive footage when I watch it, yeah
And I tear up every damn time
I promise I'm fine, but it's a lie

I don't wanna tell you, "Goodbye" as long as I live
I'll cease to exist before I figure out my shit
