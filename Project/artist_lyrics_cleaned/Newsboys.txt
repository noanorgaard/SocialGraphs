A love so bold to see a revolution somehow

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold to bring a revolution somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
And this world I'll overcome

I'll testify to all the good you do
'Cause your grace and your mercy have overtaken me

If I'm judged cause I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be

Guilty by association
Guilty of being a voice proclaiming Your ways
Your truth
Your life
I'll pay the price to be Your light

There is only one salvation

We believe in the Crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the Resurrection
And He's comin' back again

So, let our faith be more than anthems
Greater than the songs we sing
And in our weakness and temptations

Let the lost be found and the dead be raised
In the here and now, let love invade
Let the church live loud, "Our God" we'll say
We believe, we believe
And the gates of Hell will not prevail
For the power of God has torn the veil
Now we know Your love will never fail
