You better come on in this house (Come on in this house)
'Cause it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion (Rain down)
It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
You better come on in this house (Come on in this house)
'Cause it's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion (Rain down, ah)
It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)

You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
Slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy (You better, you better, you better)
Come on in this house (Come on)
'Cause it's gonna rain (Rain)
Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain (It's gonna rain)
You better come on in this house (Come on)
'Cause it's gonna rain (Rain)
Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain
