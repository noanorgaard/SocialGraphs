Welcome home!
Mari! (Ring!) Mari! (Ring!)
All together~
I'll turn everyone's hearts into a marionette~
Maria will control it! (YEAH)

I don't like feeling lonely, I want to be with you!
(Me too)
If it's here then it's fine, this hospitality with all my heart!
(Hai hai!)
I'll wear a fairy tale like but gothic dress
(Me too!)
Fluffly fluffly let's play~ Isn't it just like a fairytale world?
Happy Party

I'll always dream about the idol life
I want to sing forever and ever
With your voice added on
Let it reverberate to thе end of the universе

Let's go!
Laugh it out! (Hai!)
Laugh it out! (Hai!)
What ever you can think of (Fuwafuwafuwafuwa)
Let's make this dream come true together
A place for everyone, Puppet Cafe! (Yeah!)
Scissors paper rock! (Hai!)
Scissors paper rock! (Hai!)
Happy whether we win or lose (Fuwafuwafuwafuwa)
Isn't it a strange magic that makes you smile?
I'll give it all to you!
You might also like
There's still plenty more to go!!
Part two!

Drawing with ketchup
Covering the whole plate (Heart!)
A love that is understood
If you do such a thing as to look at someone else...
That won't be forgiven won't be forgiven won't be forgiven
(For sure for sure)
I won't let you go won't let you go won't let you go
(For sure)
I don't know what would happen~
Joking ♪
It's ok! I understand what you mean

More!
Dance away! (Hai!)
Dance away! (Hai!)
A never ending ball  (Fuwafuwafuwafuwa)
Being controlled by "happiness" to a place where dolls gather
Puppet Cafe! (Yeah!)
Isn't it amazing? (Hai!)
Isn't it amazing? (Hai!)
I'm sure this is fate (Fuwafuwafuwafuwa)
This is the chance for everyone to become one!
(Shout it loud!
