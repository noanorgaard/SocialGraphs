I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, I've gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around

Now I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh
And don't it feel good?
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good?
Hey, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life just awaiting for you
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, ah-no-no
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay, oh, yeah, now

I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, woah-oh-oh
And don't it feel good?
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good?
Yeah, oh, yeah, now
And don't it feel good?
