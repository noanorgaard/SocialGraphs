I'm lookin' at you like you's a star
'Cause you're shining in the dark
Go on and tell me every (Day with her)
I'll go there and (Put in work)
Giving you what you deserve

I'll do everything that I said I would (I'll make)
Make your body feel (Like it never did before) like it never could
If you follow me, girl, I swear I won't lead you on
When we get home

I'm gonna lay you down, turn you around (All around, baby)
Wanna make love all over this house
Baby, from the bed to the bath and beyond
However you like it
I'ma hit the spot until you can't take no more ('Til your body gives out on me)
Going in like I never, ever did before (Never did before, no)
From the bed (Oh) to the bath (Oh-oh) and beyond
However you like it, girl
You might also like
I bet you ain't never had a man like me
That's gon' make your body feel this way
I'll pull you closer, even when you say no
So, baby, let me take control now

I'll do everything (That I) that I said I would (Yeah)
Make your body feel (Make you feel) like it never could
If you follow me, girl, I swear I won't lead you on (Lead you on)

I'm gonna lay you down (Yeah), turn you around
Wanna make love all over this house (All over the couch)
Baby, from the bed (Bed) to the bath (Bath) and beyond (And beyond)
However you like it
I'ma hit the spot until you can't take no more ('Til you can't take it, baby)
Going in like I never, ever did before
From the bed (Bed) to the bath (Bath, yeah) and beyond
However you like it, girl (Oh)

I know you tired of layin' on the bed
We can stay here on the floor
You don't need no lingerie
Just put your naked body on
You know I like it when your hair gets wet
Girl, I'm gon' turn this shower on
So let's reinvent love makin'
I'll drive you crazy (Oh-oh)
I'm gonna lay you down (Yeah, yeah), turn you around (Yes, I will, baby, yeah)
Wanna make love all over this house (All over the house, oh)
Baby, from the bed to the bath (Oh-oh) and beyond (Beyond imagination, baby)
However you like it
I'ma hit the spot until you can't take no more (Hit the spots you like for me to touch, oh-oh)
Going in like I never, ever did before (Goin' in like it's a battle that I won)
From the bed (Oh-woah) to the bath (Oh-woah) and beyond
However you like it, girl

Let it bring your body on down, down, down (Bring your body on down, yeah)
Turn it up right now, now, now (Turn it up right now)
