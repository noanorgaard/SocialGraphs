Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby"
Better say my name

Any other day I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh-huh, yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holdin' you back from me

Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
