I will stand here
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again
Pretty Peggy
I used to know
Where have you gone, where did you go?

Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?

We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy
We could have it all

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I will take them all
And give them to you
I will stand here
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again

Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one more dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?

We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy
We could have it all
We will live there
Without no care
Pretty Peggy
Can I take you there?

Pretty Peggy
Was her name
Where have you gone?
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

Do you feel the same?
(We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy)
Do you feel the same?
(We will live there
Without no care

Oh, girl, I don't know all the reasons why
I found the answer lookin' in your eye
I go out walkin' all day long
Take away this lonely man, soon he will be gone

'Cause I'll tell you everything about livin' free
Yes, I can see you, girl, can you see me?

You don't need to know what I do all day
It's as much as I know, watch it waste away

'Cause I'll tell you everything about livin' free
Yes, I can see you, girl, can you a-see me?

And go and see the sorcerer, look into the ball
You may find the answer written on the wall
The left one was a dancer, can you see the answer, oh

Put her in a mansion on top of the hill
Please don't make her do the things against her will
I found something special, I don't know why
Looking into her pretty little eye

'Cause I'll tell you everything about bein' free


I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him siftin' through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away

What you see, well, you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is a-moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night

All the people that you see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home

A-can you see the joker flying over

Watching out everyday? I wonder what would happen if he took her away


I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land

So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief

I said, tell the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the
