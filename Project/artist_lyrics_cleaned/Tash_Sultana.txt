I see the way you move
It's so fluid
With you by my side
Got nothing to hide
Now that you're hurting I see
The tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love was like gold to me

But you hold me closer to the light
Wouldn't find the bullet inside
Unless you magnified
But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I, I put my faith inside my hands
'Cause I will be just fine

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Well, no nah
Well, no nah, ooh

Sitting tight with my black jeans on and I'm paralyzed
Make your way toward the sun
Got the palest soul you ever seen
Oh, darling, you mightn't be the one
Sitting tight with my curly hair
When you're making your way with that sheepish stare
Said, "Are you real? Do you feel? Are you there?"

Ashes to ashes
In the embers I blaze
Oh, I gotta rise amongst it all
And I think about your face every day
But you hold me closer to the light
You wouldn't find the bullet inside
Only if you magnified

Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Well, no nah
Well, no nah, 

I got this notion
In the deepest ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

Tell your mother she don't understand
Tell your mother she's not listening
Why don't you tie my heart with chains made of string
I rolled the dice
You sealed the deal
That don't matter
The pain is real
I won't follow you
Into the dark
