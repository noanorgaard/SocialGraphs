This is caricature
Concealer in your dresser drawer
You'll never ever get the bigger picture
There's E in the same
Kab main tere andargat, is the question of the minute ma'am
Bas listen to me
Blow me a kiss from across the room and say I look nice when I'm not, oops
And have it be true
I'll throw me under the bus for you without a fraction of a thought
Bagair soche samjhe
Banawati baatein on a shot
The shot like opposite Ls
What's felt is felt
What's not is dealt, held on a position as sama is rangeen
It's glittery not jittery like it seems baby
What's been is been, baby
What's been is been, baby

Aisi baatein, yuhi kehte nahi woh chubhti hai
Chubhti hai
Priti baatein, jo kehti humesha chubhti hai
Chubhti hai

The ghaav stays, the khoon ke daag fades
Banke sawariya, chalte saj dhajke
Pichattar, 75, the aftermath of the bloodshed
Cutthroat tales, all hail King Farookh
Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke and smog you own
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Shauhar cries take a better aim, you bloke

Acting up like a sorceress
Why's your love so torturous
Tu aati jaati out of touch
And I kept running out of fucks
I contemplated blocking you
Uss hafte your ex knocked you up
I know you needed me around
On you I just could not give up
Khana bhi na kha paane se goliyan gatkaane tak
I was with you just enough, tere stable ho jaane tak
Hafte mein 10 show karne se gaane na likh paane tak
Tune dekha sab kuch mera, tu jaane mere saare sach
Jab so jaate hain baaki sab, ghabraahat hoti kaafi
Phir aa jata tera call, aur theek hone lagta wapas sab
Aise lamhon mein main thehru, baithun, samjhun, sochu tab
Hai kya ye sab, aur kya hain hum
Kyu tolu tujhko zyada kam
The truth is I just don't know how to end this fucking verse
It's the same with you and me
And some people call it love
Like you give a fuck
And like I give a fuck
Get dressed, we're going out
I'm on my way to pick you up
Aisi baatein, yuhi kehte nahi woh chubhti hai
Chubhti hai
Priti baatein, jo kehti humesha chubhti hai
Chubhti
