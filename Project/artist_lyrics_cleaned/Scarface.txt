Mister Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, Mr. Sergeant
Just because I'm young and I'm black, I'm a target?
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake
'Cause young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes
And besides we ain't dealin' no mo'
Look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so
Everybody's yellin' peace
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police
'Cause they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip
'Cause they figure they're the master
And they can take you to jail or take your lifes
Them sorry bastards
That makes me wonder why
The five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies
And to me that shit is bull
Only God can take life, but I still gotta watch the law
It's bad enough I watch the next G
But even worse I gots to watch the motherfuckers who protect me
They fuckin packin gats yo
They serve and protect, they don't respect cause I'm black, ho
"Every black man that is a carjacker will start jackin'
Police cars and watch jaw brains shed on the dashboard
Why when you pull us over?
You show us your pistols before you ask us for our driver's license
Somethin' is not right!"

Rollin through my hood in my motherfuckin' dropper
Gettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper
But I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads
'Cause y'all was straight hoes back in school, nerdy shitheads
I finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs
'Cause niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats
You got a fuckin' pistol, now you think you're a VIP man
But you can get cut because you'd be just like the next man
Holdin' me for nothin'
Runnin' my fuckin' license plates
My plates come clean
You call the DEA
The DEA
Says I'm a known drug dealer
Straight born killer
A motherfuckin' wig splitter
He don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black
As far as he's concerned all niggas push crack
And plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check
A drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect
I gotta be doin' wrong, I'm hidin' somethin' from the demons
He gotta be slangin' yayo, let's play someone that's pregnant
'Cause niggas can't have shit but I'm a motherfuckin' troop
You come to us like Luke
Undercover David Duke
Mr. David Duke
Mr. Officer
Mister Mr. Officer
I'm pickin' out your coffin sir
Die motherfuckers, I'll send your folks my worst
A breast of pig in a motherfuckin' hearse
So fuck you motherfuckers, punk bitches take that
'Cause I'm real with the shit that I speak cause 

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back, in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions, while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve – just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now
You might also like
Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you Black, smile for me now
Smile for me
Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about
Won't you smile? No doubt, smile for me now
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life, came to dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy, hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality, we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football, chose to cook raw, wouldn't take, but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile
Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the Feds, in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is "Fuck friends" – we military-minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me – lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed, hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine upon your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say these prayers for the homie 'Pac

Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo, smile for me
Come on, smile for 

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And fuck the baddest hoes that your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
Four of the finest hoes that your ass can find

Sittin' at the stoplight, lookin' at hoes
Peepin' out this bitch in her black Girbauds
Windows rolled up tight, top was closed
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke out my nose
Opened up my door and asked the bitch, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like, "Bitch, what's up?"
She asked about my woman, I said "My woman at home"
I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone
I got my pencil and got the digits and things
And after three or four days, I gave that bitch a ring
We started talkin' and I dropped some shit
Gave her some game and now I got that bitch
Now she wants to give your homie some ass
But it's just one question I got to ask
Can you...

Gotta few hoes that wanna moan and groan
They on they way I just hung up the phone
And we gon' be like Marvin Gaye, nigga, gettin' it on
But you gots to keep your head right
And make these bitches feel at home
'Cause these bitches got they head tight
And furthermore, they bringin' weed
Just kick back, nigga, follow my lead

And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find
Hung up the horn and the hoes arrived
Three tight young tenders, them hoes was live
Rolled herself a woola, told her "Fade me, troop"
Cock bustin' at the seams of her Daisy Dukes
Ass fatter than a motherfuckin' quarter horse
Ready to take one of these bitches to the slaughterhouse
Got my shirt over my dick 'cause it's hardened to fuck
Hoes eyes gettin' red, now they wantin' to fuck
It's about time to put the game in attack
Tapped her, told her bring "ol' what's her name" in the back
Got 'em in my room, about to hop in the tub
My homie walked in, "Show your potna some love"
Told my homie, "Put it down, we finna act a fool"
The ho said, "Cool, hop yo' ass in the pool
I wanna polish up your tool"
But it's just one thing before you do
Can you...

Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news

I'm postin' at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home'
You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and that's a real life no-no
It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo
I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stone cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way
'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27, that's the rest of your fucking life

(It's in my DNA, my blood type G, my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets)

Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through
The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal
This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gon' take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, cuz in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps
You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
