Got no time, for you in my life
For you in my life, 'cause all you do is lie
Don't beg, don't cry, when I'm leavin' you behind
Leavin' you behind... (Sorry not sorry)

I can't deal with these fake, fake friends (Ooh)
Only want me for the things I give to them  (Ahh, ahh, to them)
I can't deal with these fake, fake friends
I'm cuttin' 'em off, 'till there ain't one left (Ooh)
I'm only here for the real ones

Ooh la la la
Why they always ridin' these coattails for blocks
Funny how they just won't stop
Get your own life, find your own way up to the top
You... gotta quit copyin' the things I
Do... gotta start comin' clean, facin' the
Truth... waitin' for the day that you admit you
Mooch... I ain't no fool

Behind my back
You keep talkin' all this trash
Like a fire leaves the ash
Imma leave you in my past
I'm real sorry in advance
If I'm puttin' you on blast
If I ruined all your plans
Just to get the last laugh

I can't deal with these fake, fake friends (Ooh, fake friends)
Only want me for the things I give to them  (Ahh, ahh, ooh, to them)
I can't deal with these fake, fake friends (No)
