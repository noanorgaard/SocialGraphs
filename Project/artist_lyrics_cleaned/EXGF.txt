Just play the music
Motherfucker don't stop
Spinnin' those idle hands
Ain't nothing to it
Keep hitting that spot
Indifferent while we dance
Indifferent while we dance

You (you, you, you)
You don't have the answers and think (and think, think, think, think)
And think that we all do it so you (you, you, you)
You just keep answer
And sip (sip), drink (drink), puff (puff), sniff (sniff)
Nothing but your hands can move
And we, and we, and we don't have them either
We make them up and break the ones
That don't agree with how we see it
I hide by, you're not the leader
Just play it, take a seat, watch from your spot
It's far more scenic
It's far more scenic
It's far more scenic

Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
So high that my fucking eyes roll back

Just play the music
Motherfucker don't stop
Spinnin' those idle hands
Ain't nothing to it
Keep hitting that spot
Indifferent while we dance
Indifferent while we dance

You're in the crowd but so alone
Your residence is here but still you walk so far from home
So ya faked it, made it, modeled, dated
So sophisticated, but you know you hate it
Too scared to move your feet
Watch from your spot
It's far more scenic
It's far more scenic
It's far more scenic
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
So high that my fucking eyes roll back

Just play the music
Motherfucker don't stop
Spinnin' those idle hands
Ain't nothing to it
Keep hitting that spot
Indifferent while we dance
Indifferent while we dance

Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
Fuck a pop hit, homie play a throwback
