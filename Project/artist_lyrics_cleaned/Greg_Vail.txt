Scotty said it's nowhere to nowhere
If you know a somewhere, somewhere in the middle
Then just let us know, we'll be there on the double
'Cause we only got nowhere to be
From Long Island it is a long reach
Along the country roads out to Long Beach
One day we'll make it
If we get over the mountains
But the sun's been blazing
Since we left the Atlantic
Would you take a break and just lay behind some clouds?
Because we got a lotta nowhere to see
Take it one hill at a time, Greg
How else we gonna get to Vesuvius?
If you pedal faster it makes climbing all the harder
And all those people that we pass with food and beds to offer...
Oh and even if they don't, we got a tent and though it's hotter
At least we always have somewhere to sleep!
Flying south on the Blue Ridge
I am sorry for riding on the left
But the morning shade does beckon me
As my red skin cries and my back does leak
When the canteen's dry and my knees are weak
Sometimes a little shade's the best you can get
You might also likeFrom Ashland out to who knows where
Seems like Christ's the big star there
But everyone goes "no, don't trust your neighbor
'Cause they've got it wrong and they're going to deceive ya"
And Becca said I can't pick and choose beliefs
But I got no better tools for sorting through the sawdust
As Scotty, who can't take politics at all, just prays
Out back under his Persimmon tree
From Lexington on up to Blacksburg
A wave here is as common a gesture
As opening a door, saying, "come stay in our house
You can take a shower, we'll pour another round
And if you haven't eaten we'll figure something out
Because you seem like good people to meet"
The next day down the Shenandoah Valley
From a mattresses the storm’s menacing ahead
But looking through that lens does nothing for ya
Rather makes you scared and wanna stay inside instead
Take it one day at a time Greg
How else you gonna get to your "somewhere"?
If you get tired just sit a little longer
And if you got it in ya, then bike a little farther
And if nowhere sounds better then go to California
Sounds like a fine destination to
