We don't have to go, go home
We can stay here
Layed out on the floor
Have one more 'til the room clears
Pour all the champagne
Make it rain
We can stay here
Stay here

And don't say the party's over
'Cause we've got time to let it go
And don't say we're leaving sober
Just stay the night, don't take me home
And don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
And don't say it's over, over, over, no
Don't say it's over
You might also like
Give me one more dance
One more kiss
We don't need a song
Take another hit, 'nother sip
All before it's gone

You don't have to go, go home
You can stay here
Tell me you won't go
Take it slow 'til the rooms clears
Give me one more dance, one more kiss
We can stay here, stay here

And don't say the party's over
'Cause we've got time to let it go
And don't say we're leaving sober
Just stay the night, don't take me home
Stay the night
And don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
And don't say it's over, over, over, no
Don't say it's over
Don't say it, don't say
Don't say it, don't say
Don't say it

Only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
Only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
Only got one night, one time, don't say goodbye
Only got one night, one time

And don't say the party's over
'Cause we've got time to let it go
And don't say we're leaving sober
Just stay the night, don't take me home
And don't say it's over (No)
Don't say it's over
And don't say it's over, over, over, no
Don't say it's over, no

Pour all the champagne
Make it rain
We can stay here
Stay 

It's been a week since you hit my bed
And since then, you've started living in my head, eh
Seven days, and I'm nearly dead
Never thought that I'd reboot
But you're a different kind of new

It's like I feel everything more (I forget to)
All my body knows it when you reach my floor, eh
My heart is beating down the door
And now I'm stocking up on oxygen

'Cause when I see you
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
(I forget to)

If I could just inhale some chill
It's like I'm living out in space
How am I still here?
Did you slip me a magic pill?
Got me lifted like an astronaut
No helmet on and my lungs just stop

So please, when you look at me like that
There's no way to fight back, no
Please, can't you see I'm stocking up on oxygen?

'Cause when I see you
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
When I see you, I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to, when I'm with you

I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
Give me it, give me it

I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
When I see you, I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to, when I'm with you

Every time, yeah, why do you try to deny it?
When you show up every night and
Tell me that you want me
But it's complicated, so complicated

When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

Every time that I swear it's over
It makes you want me even more
You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn

Wide awake through the daylight
Would you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?

When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)

Maybe I should think before I talk
I get emotional and words come out all wrong
Sometimes I'm more honest than I want
So maybe I should think before
Maybe next time, I'll think before I talk

I try my best to make it better (Better)
I'm all out of apologies (Apologies)
You know I'm not good under pressure (Pressure)
'Cause hurting you is hurting me (Hurting me)
I took all that we built and I broke it (Broke it)
And I pray it won't tear us apart
So let me piece it back together
I know I cut you pretty deep (Know I cut you pretty deep)

And I might get too far under your skin
