And all those things I didn't say
Were wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey, ha)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (Hey)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (Ha)
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
You might also like
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home (I miss my home)
But there's a fire burning in my bones (In my bones)
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey, ha)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (Hey)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes (Ha)
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song (Hey)
Take back my life song (Hey)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey)
My power's turned on (Hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song (Hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

No, I've still got a lot of fight left in 

Hands, put your empty hands in mine
And scars, show me all the scars you hide
And hey, if your wings are broken
Please take mine 'til yours can open too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I
And love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too

'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
You might also like
Yeah, you're all I never knew I needed
And the heart, sometimes it's unclear why it's beating
And love, if your wings are broken
We can brave through those emotions too
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you

And oh, truth, I guess truth is what you believe in
And faith, I think faith is having a reason
No, no, no, love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too

'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
I'll be your eyes 'til yours can shine
I'll be your arms, I'll be your steady satellite
And when you can't rise
Well, I'll crawl with you on hands and knees
'Cause I...

I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we're breaking down
We can find a way to break through (Come on)
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven
I'll walk through hell with you
Love, you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Love, you're not alone
No, I'm gonna stand by you

(Even if we can't find heaven, heaven, heaven...)
I'm gonna stand by
