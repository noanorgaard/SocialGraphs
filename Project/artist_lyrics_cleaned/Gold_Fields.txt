Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause it's dark again
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
It's dark again
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

We've been living with the lights out
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash
We're losing sight
We've been living with the lights out
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash
We're losing sight of everything

The hounds bring hate, man they're so loud (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
They bark and break their way through town (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
That violence makes me feel so proud (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause my silence takes you to the clouds (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause it's dark again
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
Now in the dark again
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

We've been living with the lights out
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash
We're losing sight
We've been living with the lights out
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash
We're losing sight of everything

Deep thinker, ship sinker
Channel me on your way down
Slow drinker, hard liquor
This sea won't let you drown
Deep sleeper, slow blinker
Wake up to what we've found
Slow faker, heart breaker
Broke free, we're heaven bound
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause it's dark again
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

We've been living with the lights out
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash
We're losing sight (Of everything)
We've been living with the lights out (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Been moving in the night
Keep swimming through the white wash (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're losing sight of everything

Deep thinker, ship sinker
Channel me on your way down
Slow drinker, hard liquor
This sea won't let you drown
Deep sleeper, slow blinker
Wake up to what we've found
Slow faker, heart breaker
Broke free, we're heaven
