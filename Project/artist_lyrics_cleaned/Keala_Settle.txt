I don't wanna know. 

C'mon honey, you've waited long enough

Get to it and do it

Okay girls, enough!

You know what we mean

I hope you drank enough this mornin'

C'mon sweetie, it's better to know
We'll be right here with you so

It's no or it's yes
But either way you gotta take the test
You might also like
A squat and a squeeze
A prayer and a please
It's nothin'

A stick and a line

Just one of 'em - if I'm lucky

A pot and a piss
Here we go sis
An' we'll keep our focus on

The negative!

Read the instructions

Do not insert the test stick into your vagina. 

Wooow. Thank you, Dawn. 

How'd I ever get myself in this mess?
One drunk night an' that stupid red dress

Aw, I love that red dress! The way it sparkles, it looks like a ice-skating outfit!

Ugh, stay with us, Dawn!

Maybe his machinery is broken somehow?
What if his boys don't swim, I mean, wow!
(spoken)
Miraculous luck!

Damn, miraculous!
(sung)
To get away with an unprotected fu-!
Funny how one night
Can ruin your whole life

Don't go there yet
We don't know what the test says

I'm already panicked!

Just calm down, god damn it!

Maybe it'll all be fine

Maybe there'll be just one line

Come on, negative!

I thought you don't sleep with your husband much anymore?

Well, I - (sigh)  he got me drunk. I do stupid things when I drink, like — sleep with my husband. 

Honey, we've all made that mistake!

Focus on the negative!

This will all be alright

It was only one night

Someone
Send me a sign

One line

One line

That means the test is ready
This is it...

...shit
