"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore


"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around, it's all I do
When I'm with you
