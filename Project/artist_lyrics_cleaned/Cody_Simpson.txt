And yet, I'm feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side
I had a little taste, and I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you

All these places packed with people, but your face is all I see
And the music's way too loud, but your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around, they're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has got me spun, and I don't know what to say next

'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind

La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you

I pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the bros, la-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind, la-de-da, yeah, I—
And yet, I'm feeling like (Whoa)
There is no better place than right by your side (By your side)
I had a little taste, and I'll only spoil the party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind (Ooh, yeah)

La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you (La-da-da, you, you)
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
There's only me, there's only you (There's only you)
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
La-da-da, me, la-da-da, you
La-da-dee, la-da-da-doo
When you were gone, I think of
