You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around

No one knows you better than yourself
Tryna tell me all these faking sells
I see what it really is
Honest words, will never fizz
Give it to me I can hold my own
I know what it's like to be alone
No need to keep me in the dark
Already been, I got that spark


You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around
You don't know how it is
For someone else to own you
Someone else to throw your heart around

No one knows you better than yourself
Tryna tell me all these faking sells
I see what it really is
Honest words, will never fizz
Give it to me I can hold my own
I know what it's like to be alone
No need to keep me in the dark
Already been, I got that spark
