Cowboys and angels

We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation, her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous

I'm not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh! Maybe God just kinda likes

It ain’t in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain’t where it is

It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that

River rushing and a warm breeze blowing

Gravel grinding while we're finding
