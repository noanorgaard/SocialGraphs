And I've been keepin' to myself (Self)
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watchin' anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?

You know I used to be in 1D (Now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (That's not me)
I'm not changin' the way that I (Used to be)
I just wanna have fun and (Get rowdy)
One Coke and Bacardi (Sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (Girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (Six gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (Grinds on me, baby)
Oh, yeah, oh

You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (Swing)
You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know that since the day I met you
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
You know that I don't need no money
When your love is beside me
Yeah, you opened up my heart
And then you threw away the key
Girl, now it's just you and me
And you don't care 'bout where I've been

You know I used to be in 1D (Now I'm out, free, free)
