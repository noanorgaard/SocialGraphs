So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"

I'm looking down, now that it's over, reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere, somewhere in His grace
I cried out "Heaven save me", but I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say, let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
"Maybe six feet ain't so far down"
I'm so far down

When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe

It feels so good to reunite
