I keep one eye open to the shadows on the floor

All nights are the same, voices call my name
And I can't ignore 'em, can't ignore 'em
All night and day, suffering the strain
Of paranoia, paranoia

With what I've become
There's someone creeping close, someone's creeping close
Over my shoulder, shoulder
When I turn around, then I turn around
And they're nowhere, nowhere

I keep waking up and thinking someone's at the door
I keep one eye open to the shadows on the floor

All nights are the same, voices call my name
And I can't ignore 'em, can't ignore 'em
All night and day, suffering the strain
Of paranoia,
