Swagged-out crew with the kids on deck
Social Club, Rhema
Yep, add it up, those misfits
Misfits, all on the grill
But they taste this, don't take a spill
We ain't cockroach, we ain't

But I came to murk
It's a Monday, I'm paid to work

Drinks on me, course I see
To be fair, yeah, I keep it clean
Ba-Ballin' with my peeps
And now I'm shining, watch me 
'Cause when I say I'm ballin', ballin'
'Cause I'm ballin' differently
Yeah, gotta let the lady flow
Chicks in the game, yeah, we need some more

You know it's killing them season
To be so relieving and soothing
We got the people believing
My circle's built for the movement
These squares are thirsting and fiending
Treating the game like we own it
Like what LeBron did in Cleveland
We out in LA, yeah, LA
We don't sell yay, but we pedal dope
And we let 'em know, 'cause you never know
Miami to Marina Del Rey, uh (Woo)
My crew is illy, like, for really, really
Achilles' heel-ies
We are the lames
With that poison like salmonell-ies
On some Kevin Hart they silly, silly
We poppin' a wheelie
Got all our hands on the game
And they still try to cop a feely
Got a billy club in the trunk
To beat the game out of a milli'
The Maybach is in the shop
So we ballin' out after Jilly

You know the streets, I'm about it
So grab a seat, crowd around me
It's time to preach and I'm all about it
I'm all in, all in, all in
And I can go on in, on in
The wifey, I'm so charming, yeah, I know
I wish everybody could feel just like I do
I do, I do 
But I feel like I just won the lotto
Man, I'm lovin' my life
Friends and fam make me feel like the  type
At the top of my game like Jordan
Killin' it in '89, right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's me
I live like I ain't got nowhere to be
Even if I ain't got nowhere to sleep
I got a young rich mentality
Yeah, 'cause even with half a billi'
For me, that ain't nothing really
As long as God is standing with me
I'm ballin' hard
