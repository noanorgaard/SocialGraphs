You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and rawhide (Rawhide)
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high (High)
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns (Buns)
You was there when the money was gone (Gone)
You'll be there when the money comes (Comes)

Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed (Blowed)
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo (Chulo)
And every time we kick it (Uh)
It's off to the groovy (Groove)
Treat you like my sticky icky
Or my sweet ooh-wee, gooey (Yeah, for real, though)

Now, I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
And uh-uh, and there ain't nothin' you can say to a player
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full-grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Bravada
Rockin' Dolce Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana

Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

Now look at that dumper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she shaking that rumpa
And, oh, you ain't know? She get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin'

You gon' hear it clack-clack when them heels get to burnin'

And got us all doin' the tornado

(Verse 1)
Saturday mornin'
Just wakin' up
Still kind of high, still kind of drunk (Kind of drunk)
I turned on the shower
A text on my phone
We're meeting at the park
Once again, it's on
Now I was drivin' in a (???) freshly fitted
Oooh, Era hat
Matchin' goats to go with it
And I hop in my old school (Old school)
I'm so cool (So cool)
When I'm sittin' all day in the day
I'm on my way

Get up, it's really on
In a
Major way
Everybody's callin' my phone
I said, "I'm
On my way"
I'm on my way
In a old school with the radio on (They're playing my song)
It's a
Beautiful day (Beautiful day)
Got a barbecue, goin' on
I said, "I'm
On my way"
I'm on my way

I'm on my way, way, high as a ray, gaye
Saturday's lovely girl, cause Friday was pay day
With no further delay, lay
I'm scoopin' up day, day
In a drop Chevrolet (Hey)
Smokin' on grade A
Grade A
Someone beamin' on my cap in the turnin' lane
Candy paint, lookin' wetter than a hurricane
Another cleaner than this beamer on the B's and Q's
Called up
Louie, Louie, got the trees and brew
I got a game to top-notch in
Timer like diamond watches
Just waitin' for a player's call
Get out, your iPhone and listen to Cyclone
Baby girl, we gon' do it all
Repeat Chorus
(Verse 2)
Pulled up to the car, it's on and crackin'
Dominoes at the table, you know what's happenin'
See shawty over there, she's the main attraction
Lookin' over my way, like she's 'bout the action
You know what I want, and I'm out to come get it
So write down your number and your name to go get it
I'm so cool (So cool)
You know who (You know who)
When I'm sittin' all day in the day
I'm on my way
Hook: Major James
All my peoples kickin' back on a Saturday
Around the way, everything is all good
Barbecue grill on a sunny day
And if you ain't knowin' nobody, you should
Summertime
Everything's right
And it's about to go down
The honies all around
Tonight, the Saturday in my hood
Repeat Chorus
