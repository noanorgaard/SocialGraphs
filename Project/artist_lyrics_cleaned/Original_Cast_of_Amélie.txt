Sweet lemon ices!

What was that?

An envelope opens
A cat in a hallway
A filament flashes, flickers, and dies
And there goes a hat

Thrown in the air!

Thrown in the air!

I can feel every stranger in Paris just waiting to collide
How a heart can crow like a moon as we circle each other
Then crashing together!
We end up open wide!

Here where the bus has stopped you can find a kiosk under staples and glue!
Now the barber shop, now the laundromat, now we're at the metro, Adieu!

Wait! Tell me your name!

Goodbye!

Goodbye! Thank you!

I can see everything clearly now
From 

I hear you coming

What can I do to

Drown out this drumming

No turning back now that you took the breadcrumbs
And I lost the away
And arrows fall out of thin air
Don't expect me to play fair
If I could just find the right words to say
Would you stay right there
I like you right there!

Stay
Stay
Stay

Stay where you are!
Safe in a frame
Try to move closer, you'll only get halfway!
Pin down your heart, put out the flame
Don't come any closer

But don't move away!
Stay where you are!
Safe in a frame
Try to move closer
You'll only get halfway!
Pin down your heart, put out the flame
Don't come any closer
But don't move away!
Stay
Stay
Stay!
Stay where you are!
 
 
 
Pin down your heart!
 
Don't move away!
Stay
Stay

Likes giving salutes

In his army doctor uniform

Always liked the idea of a daughter

But not so sure now that I've got one

He likes to swim
But dislikes wet swimming suits

Likes to clean
And organize his tools

He likes his daughter in theory

But doesn't really like it when he

Has to touch
