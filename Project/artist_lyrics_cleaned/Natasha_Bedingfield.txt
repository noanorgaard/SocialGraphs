Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat

The sun is on my side, and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alright
The sun is on my side, and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be 

Every day I fight for all my future somethings
A thousand little wars I have to choose between
I could spend a lifetime earning things I don't need
But that's like chasing rainbows and comin' home empty

And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'll be alright

Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million

But you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
No, you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that

I don't need a microphone (Yeah)
To say what I've been thinking
My heart is like a loudspeaker
That's always on eleven

And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'm still the same

Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million

But you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
No, you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that

'Cause when it all boils down at the end of the day
It's what you do and say that makes you who you are
Makes you think about, think about it, doesn't it?
Sometimes all it takes is one voice
Take what you want, steal my pride (Oh)
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million

But you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
No, you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
You ain't taking that

Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
