This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

If you want to be free
Below the ground's the only place to be
'Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity

This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

Bring wings to the weak and bring grace to the strong
May all evil stumble as it flies in the world
All the tribes come and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night and have faith in love

I'm tryna find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me (There's nothing wrong with me)
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?

Do you know what you're fighting for?

Party at the beach down in Copacabana
Sipping Killepitsch, got my black yoga pants on
Me and Brittany, we’ve been down in Atlanta
Sweating in the club, call me Dirty Diana
Flexing like a yogi, drop it down with your hands up
Do a handstand, bend it back, put your legs up
I ain’t got no worries, I’m my own private dancer
My own private dancer

I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let your booty do that yoga

Crown on my head, but the world on my shoulder
I'm too much a rebel, never do what I’m supposed ta
Bend it never break it, baby watch and I’ma show ya
Stretching on my cash, got my money doing yoga
Sometimes I'm PG, and sometimes I'm vulgar
Even when I’m sleeping, I got one eye open
You cannot police me, so get off my areola
Get off my areola

I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

Looking for my loafers, man I woke up in a toga
She left my collar on like she my owner
So when she downward dog, I jump up on her
I lo-lo-love the way you bend
Oh Lord, I’d love to break you in
Oh Lord, I’d stretch you out and in
Oh Lord, now you should tell a friend
Oh Lord, I pray, pray, I pray they come, come, come on over
And let they bum-bum do that yoga

You're going crazy, the hitmen always find you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls' room
Kissin' friends, it's over like a comic book
Exploding in a bathroom stall, ah
She's so freaked out, worried 'bout the bomb threat
You bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit cards, they bought a new wife for shiny little lonely men

But I really, really want to thank you for dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
(Dance apocalyptic) Tell me, will you break out?
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang

Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Ooh baby
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang

You gotta laugh at the zombie in the front yard
Take a bath, but nothing gets the funk off
You're on TV, rockin' and a-rollin'
'Cause the dead just love to rock and roll

Sick and tired of food tasting plastic
You wanna cry, but they grew up without a real kitchen
Asking why the pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

Cold in the cell, lost and shivering
Gunshots in hallways unknown
