Is Seger singin' "Hollywood Nights"
"Even the Losers" get lucky sometimes
A "Paradise by the Dashboard Light"
And I'm just fine, I'm doin' alright
We ain't as young as we use to be
But "Young at Heart" is so easy
When you let some loud guitars
And words that rhyme
Handle the hands of time

My go-to game day jersey’s always Carolina blue
When I need to find forgiveness
I find a little small town church pew, yeah
After work I like to put my elbows up on a bar
And, girl, I turn to the speakers
When I need to speak to this ol' heart

And it's "Back in Black", "Shook Me All Night Long"
"Could You Be Loved "Redemption Song"
"Luckenbach", "Home Sweet Home"
I'm where I belong
Ain't nothing wrong, yeah
We ain’t as young as we use to be
But "Young at Heart" is so easy
When you let some loud guitars
And words that rhyme
Handle the hands of time

And it's "Amazing Grace," how sweet the sound
"Sunday Morning Coming Down"
"Tuesday's Gone", "Green Grass of Home" (Tuesday's gone)
"I Come to the Garden Alone", yeah (Oh, oh)
We ain’t as young as we used to be
But until under that willow, you bury me
I'm gonna turn up some loud guitars

Turn up some loud guitars
Turn up some loud guitars
Crank some loud guitars
Crank up some loud guitars
Wanna hear some loud guitars
Gonna let some loud guitars
And words that rhyme
Handle the hands of
