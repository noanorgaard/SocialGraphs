And no labels to put on
To this thing we keep
And dip into when we need
And I don't have the right
To ask you where you go at night
When the waves hit my head
To think there's someone in your bed
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
Torches glow as they hit the ground 'cause everybody's showing
Mercy for the big Genghis Khan to the Mongol plains he's going
He's gonna take over, gonna succeed
For the reference now you're the one that I need
So march along together we stand here
If you're gonna go judge then keep it real
Think about life he's gone to steal
Everybody knows why he rose
Negative feelings, standard shows
Take it away get rid of the name
Everybody knows so you can't complain
So march along together we stand here
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but
