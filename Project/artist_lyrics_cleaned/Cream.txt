I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning, and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darlin', now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning, and just we two

I’ll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long

I’ve been waiting so long

In the sunshine of your 

In a white room, with black curtains
Near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements
Tired starlings
Silver horses, ran down moonbeams
In your dark eyes
Dawn light smiles, on you leaving
My contentment

I'll wait in this place
Where the sun never shines
Wait in this place
Where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you
At the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels
Goodbye window
I walked into such a sad time
At the station
As I walked out, felt my own need
Just beginning

I'll wait in the queue
When the trains come back
Lie with you
Where the shadows run from themselves


At the party, she was kindness
In the hard crowd
Consolation, for the old wound
Now forgotten
Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles
In her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows
Tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place
With the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark
Where the shadows run from themselves

1 ContributorCrossroads - live at winterland, san francisco / 1968 LyricsI went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
"Take me, if you please"
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
Well, I'm going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside

Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run
Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Believe I'm sinking
