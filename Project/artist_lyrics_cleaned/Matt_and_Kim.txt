I was up in my head for everything I said
Quote a million words, they're all made of lead
I bought a megaphone to use inside your home
Forgot the batteries, but that's the old me

Shouting out of my windows
Rolled down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said, "I don't care"
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

I'm standing on the top of a parking lot
I gave it all I had, show me what you got
There's some things I've found that makes so much sound
All these words, I don't need 'em now

Shouting out of my windows
Rolled down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said, "I don't care"
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Say what you wanna say
Make it mean, everything
Oh say what you wanna say

Let's run, run, run, run away
Don't bring, bring anything
Somewhere, where, where, where we'll stand
Without locks, keys, and kings

Called on the last pay phone
Just to hear it ring

Let's run, run, run, run away
Don't bring, bring anything
Somewhere, where, where, where we'll stand
Without locks, keys, and kings

Saw it on a postcard
Stamped and on its way
(I see you, Kevin Bacon)

Without locks, keys, and kings
All day, day, day, dayall day
All day, day, day, I wait
I bust, bust, bust, bust my way
Or maybe I'm too late

Got to call on the last pay phone
But they've disappeared

They, me, them
I'll find you
They, me, 

Can you blame me for just being alive?
Can you blame me for just being alive?

Climbing the Manhattan bridge
Gave the finger to our city with a kiss
We get kicked out of the bar
I know, I know sometimes I take things way too far

Can you blame me for just being alive?

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday, I’ll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don’t pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
You might also likeI have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I’ll just unplug it for today
I’ll just unplug it for today
Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down grand street in daylight

And float down grand street in daylight
And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don’t pick up my phone
