Let your hair down, hair down, get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off, get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
You ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up
Girl, what do you say? (What do you say?)
We'll cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

Country 

In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

How I keep catching her eye
Man, I keep wondering why
Ain't nothing special 'bout
An "awe shucks" country boy
Lord, she's sure lookin' good
Like something from Hollywood
She got me thinkin' that I just might
Leave here with her tonight

No need to change a thing, hey y'all

Cause I am who I am and that's
The man I'm gonna be, yeah
And when the Lord comes callin'
Well, he ain't gonna have
To holler, y'all
There'll be no trouble finding me

He's gonna take me home
Lord, with my boots 

It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss

I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell them we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to

Woah
Girl, every now and then, you get a night like this
Woah
This one that we don't wanna miss, no

Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Out of the blue pullin' into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear?

Oh, Heaven, let your light shine down

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancing
Didn’t take long, just a couple of songs
You know it’s last call when the law comes walking in

So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end

Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right
