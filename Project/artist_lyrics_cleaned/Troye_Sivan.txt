Oh, our lives don’t collide, I’m aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things you like stick, and I like aerosol

And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls

Where you can be reborn

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach out and touch

My mind's gone a-racing
On a horse that's escaping
