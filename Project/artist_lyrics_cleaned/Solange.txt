I know you're waiting for the words that you can't get from me
Just treat me good and baby I'll give you the rest of me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy

Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no use
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?

There's nothing more, I know you're taking it away from me
I gave you everything and now there's nothing left for me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy

Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?

I'm a cool old Jane with the skip on my feet
I play tough as nails with my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sand castle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away

Who would've known, the storm of my past time
Would oh baby, make me, losing the song of the eye
And I can't believe you or read you
Cause there's pleasure in your preview
It's all in your eyes
But oh Mr. DJ, baby, can you meet me outside?

Away, 

When I was just a girl I felt just so alone
Locked myself in closets thinking, "If I was the only one"
Dim light shining on my room
Locked up in this old cocoon

Look at me, I'm just a girl still feeling so alone
Looking at myself thinking, "Best to come and easy go"
Street light shining on my room
Locked up in this old cocoon (Street light shining on my room)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

And all I wanted was the dream of being in love with you (Oh, oh, ooh)
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you (Oh, oh, ooh)
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you

When I was just a girl I wore a thousand lives
Heading on a search for the thing that makes me feel alright
Ten black moments in my room
Diamonds shimmers from the moon
And now I'm just a girl living in the satellite
Took what I needed from this town and getting down at night
Street light shining in my room
Getting out the suns up soon

And all I wanted was the dream of being in love with you (Oh, baby)
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you (Oh, oh, ooh)
All I wanted was the dream of being in love with you

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, 

It's everything that I seem to ignore
The classroom that I treated as a bore
The pocketbook I say I never saw
The hearts I stole and I'll never call

The bed I woke up in that's not my own
The make-up I applied two days ago
The night I lost my phone on the way home
The taxi came, I don't know where I'm going, no

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, I can't help it, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah

And still I tried to pull you into my own hurricane
It's like you spot me trying from a thousand miles away
I look down on your soul, deep down I know that we're the same
It's stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game

Let's stay out of trouble, you make it look good

Wanna go to Sak when nobody comes look

Take me to the bridge but be sure to come look

Baby, we've got time for time to wait
I put you on the line, no choice to make
Running only slows you down the way
When every minute moving's yours to take

We turn time into shapes
The way you're loving me
We turn hours into space, oh, oh, oh
We put seconds into stars
The way you're loving me
Turn circles into hearts, oh, baby

So baby, is it all you've got?
Tell me if you got some more
I'm thinking of some time off, off
I'm dreaming of a time that you knew me
Some things never seem to fucking work

Remember when you kissed me (Kissed me)
At Jimmy John's when I was 17
Convinced myself you were the shit (Were the shit)
Convinced myself you loved me (Lo-o-oved me)

So baby, is that all you've got?
Tell me if you got some more
I'm thinking of some time off (Time off, off)

Remember when you missed me (Missed me)
We'd accidentally meet purposely
Convinced that we were meant to be (Meant to be)
Convinced myself you loved me (Lo-o-oved me)

So baby, is it all you've got? (All you've got)
Tell me if you got some more

Well, maybe if it's all you wanted

Some things never seem to fucking work

So tell me, is it real love or some kind of mistake
That we made together that we couldn't anticipate?
And my attraction to you made all that much worse
Desire for something, maybe
Along with a hatred of myself
Not wanting to end up alone
So the night I saw you
I could pretend I thought you were beautiful
And that's all I ever really saw
But the truth is, as much as I hate it, you were a bore
So I try and deny it, although I try to fight it
As I brought your ride home on the 95 bus
Never thought down the line
That us would eventually become an us
So to the others, looking from the outside in
So now I'm calling out
For a way to give myself in
Remember when you kissed me, when I was seventeen
I thought to myself that you were the shit
That you loved me

So maybe then we're better off
Well, maybe if it's all you wanted
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
So maybe then we're better off (Better off)
Well, maybe if it's all you wanted
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Some things never seem to fucking 

Back and forth, behind and down
When you were in and I was out
We chasing lovers in the front line of the parking lot
And baby I loved you
But I was not done having my fun

Played around with your heart
Now I'm laying around in the dark
Played around with your heart
Now I'm paying when we're apart (Yeah)
Played around with your heart
Guess I played myself from the start
Played around with your heart

Where oh where's the man
That landed in my hands when I say fall
I pushed you head over my heels
Until I pushed you far
And baby I need you
But you just don't want nothing at all
