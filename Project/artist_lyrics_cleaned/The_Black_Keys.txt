I'll take no mess and I'll take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive

Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good
Say my name three times and you knock on wood
Candy man hooks, I terrorize your hood
Flashing Mac's on a cop the way a gangsta should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath then I walk through fire
Bear-hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty
Take the Sergeant's hat from his head and use it for a frisbee
Spit in the crocodile face
Have a ménage à trois with two female apes
Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives
I drank honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked!
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked!
With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
When the Grim Reaper come, I'll look him right in his eye
I'll bust off in the face of the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth (Hahaha)
I'm the man who stole the golden fleece
And I date-raped beauty right in front of the beast

Oh, no

You were acting like everything was alright
'Til later on, with no one around

I thought you'd change, but I should'a known
You'd play nice for a time, and then you'd do me wrong
