Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time
And try to not waste any more of mine
Get outta here fast

I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh-oh, oh-ohh
You might also like
You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, oh
But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

All my life I've tried (Tried)
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt (Hurt) and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh-oh, who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Lemme hold your crown, babe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah, 

I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for a someone, the wrong one
And I tell myself to let the story end, oh
That my heart will rest in someone else's hand
But my 'why not me?' philosophy began
And I say

Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday

Maybe it's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me where I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands
But no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
That's not me anymore
And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
But I dare you, darlin', just you wait and see
But this time, not for you, but just for me
I said

Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday

Say it's coming soon
Someday without you
All I can do is get me past the ghost of you
Wave goodbye to me
I won't say I'm sorry
I'll be alright
Once I find the other side of someday

Ohh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Ohh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh (Whoa, oh-oh)
Whoa, oh-oh (Whoa, oh-oh)
Whoa, oh-oh
Oh-oh, ohh
Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But 

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too

To write you a love song today

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you (Write you) a love song today
Today (Yeah), 

Say what you wanna say

Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing, bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
