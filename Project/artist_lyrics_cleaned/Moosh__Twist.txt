Man you know we ain't blood'
So why you be calling me cousin (man i'm not your cousin)
Even Steven can see me, it's easy
No wonder we buzzing (x2)
When they talking the realest you never come up in discussion
I'm like, "Where the cash at?"
You know, shorty ass fat, I need, 25 bands
In a Louis backpack
Smokin' on that Kobe Bryant, cause I never pass that
And you always tryin' chill, but can never match that
Damn, Growing Pains had em all talking
Everybody in the mall bought it
Big business no small talkin'
Got a bag on me like i'm dog walking
They ain't do it but they made a case, he tried killin' but they'd made em wait
Gettin' to it like it's 01, man i'm LA Reid with a baby face
215 till I D.I.E, bad bitch need a see ID
King shit like T.I.P
20 bands for the V.I.P
But the bank closed, yeah it's hella empty
We've been down since elementary
Fuck boys want to bet against me
I don't know, man it kinda tempt me

Every time I gotta catch the vibe
Down for the squad and we set to ride
Got a small team no extra guys
I ain't gettin' high got checks to sign
I feel too close to be next in line
The clock on the wall say I'm pressed for time
Tryna make cash for the team, bout to crash on the scene
Like a homie tryna text and drive
I'm in a foreign whip, dog it's European
Talk to me like i'm a human being
I'm in a crew that they would kill to be in
Your man's bitch, would never wana be him
I heard my song all on ESPN
Mom's calling me she was fucking tweakin
In The Hills, I Can't Feel My Face , come get Acquainted with the fucking weekend (Weeknd)
Me and my brother just sped off the lot
I'm on a mission for bread and the guap
Bitches in love with the threats that I cop
And I'm comin off top like some head that I got
I be in the beat straight spazing, flow fantastic
I was in the back of the class with the pad that I had all of my raps in
Putting in practice, tryna fill the gap like an AD-LIB
Take a picture with a Kodak, go get that shit developed
You can see they jealous
Hating on me nothin' they can tell us
Sick, and the music is medicine
Use it as remedy, I can feel it, I'm loving the melody
I don't fuck with not one of my enemies, but you're not my friend don't pretend to be
Please don't pretend to be!
