Stay for the night, tell you why nothing's right if you're gone
Stay for the night, if it's all a lie, I wouldn't mind if you're wrong
Stay for the night, we've been alright for so long
There's no coloring around us anymore
You either know or you don't

Don't want the world to know what makes me weak
Don't want the world to know that side of me
When I never even leave

Stay for the night, tell you why nothing's right if you're gone
Stay for the night, if it's all a lie, I wouldn't mind if you're wrong
Stay for the night, we've been alright for so long
There's no coloring around us anymore
You either know or you don't
Don't try your best to stall
