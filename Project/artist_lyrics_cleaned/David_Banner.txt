Got diamonds in my mouth (Yeah), got some Gucci on my seat
Got G's on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck

Still screamin' out mayne (Mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (Throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, eighty-four's on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

Cadillac's on 22s
I ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
Pimp my voice and mack these beats
Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets

God I know that we pimp, God I know that we wrong
God I know I should talk about more in all my songs
I know these kids are listening, I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get em when 22" rims are glistening
I know these walls are talking, Lord I want to do right
I tried to fight but these demons they come to me at night
Like my Momma, my Daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Michelle but I guess I still got Dwayne and Roy
My cousin Sweets, Mama Lena and Jason
Lord I'm praying for SWAC, my heart is steady pacing
Keep him off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell, man of what he was
Yeah smoke and get a buzz, but God I hear you calling
And shit wrong with balling, but my soul is just steady falling
In to sex and the debt, into an Earthly jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell

Lord they hung Andre Jones
Lord they hung Raynard Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord please just tell me something
My folks still dumping my music bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is steady pumping, my heart is steady breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is hell and just a place for us to learn
Bout your love, your will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here feeling so dark
It's feeling so cold, Lord I'm getting so old
I don't if I can take this world right here no more
22 inch rims on the 'Lac
I guess that was your footprint in the sand carrying us on your back
