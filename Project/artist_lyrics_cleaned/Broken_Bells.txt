Ain't nobody callin', ain't nobody home
What a lovely day to be lonely
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love
You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love

Light another cigarette, burning in the cold
Waiting on the street for your man
You're trying not to look so young and miserable
You gotta get your kicks while you can

And in the Latin Quarter
Sitting on your own
What a lovely day to be lonely

Well you might belong to another time
Still you have to carry on, yeah
Nowhere else to go and you never know
What to hide and what to show, no

You're holding on for life, holding on for life
You're holding on for love

Wrong just seems so right
'Til the spark of morning light
And all those searching eyes
Do they scald your tender hide?

Remember what they said
"There's no shortcut to a dream
It's all blood and sweat
And life is what you manage in between"
Oh, what you don't know
Is you're too young and eager to love
This evening I see you're about to get into the ditch
That your old man dug

See the stars align
(Ooh)
And leave you behind

You want it so, and I

I come by light of an Autumn moon

Sister you know enough

But for now just let it go

Don't run, don't rush

Just flow

Through the give and take you've had to learn
How to cross the coals and not get burned
But you're really just a little girl
Playing in the park, 'til the sun goes down
So twenty-one arrives
One day and your time is up
No doubt you think you braided your own hair
So you're all grown up
Should you wanna 'cross the line?
Which way do you wanna fight?
Pretend that love could help you find your way
But you got me wrong
Yeah, you got me 

'Cause I'm waiting here much too long and
Don't assume that I need your love
The chill of night has got you dancing away, and I'm
Not the dreamer or the dream you're out there looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love
And there's something wrong
Well it's sending you round and round
Still we go nowhere

I see the ashes on the ground
Another world is burning down
And under the cold and empty moon
But after the disco
All of the shine just faded away, ooh
Do what you want, do what you will
But you can't hide, ooh
Do what you want, do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time

It's coming, wait for it
We're done in, no contest
Of a sudden, your god is only the cold old grey you been avoiding
This city, your culture
Your modern, day suffering
Is over, so what if
I love it, I can't help it
That's all

Subtle guns and a glimpse of our intentions
I turn a stone to find a beaming light
I form no more words as I can not dare see the joy now
Washing me over

That's 

It's not too late
To feel a little more alive
Make our escape
Before we start to vaporize
Doubtless, we've been through this
So if you want to follow me you should know
I was lost then and I'm lost now
And I doubt I'll ever know which way to goYou might also 

You gotta give it up, give it up, give it up, oooh
Give it up, give it up, oooh
Give it up, give it up, you lost control
'Cause nothing stays around too long

So now everything has changed
And your heart's been rearranged
Until nothing we've known here remains
And you say you shouldn't stay
As you're taking off your clothes
You think it's loving, I suppose
It's just you endlessly needing control

Well you gotta give it up, give it up, give it up, oooh

Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many heads
To analyze
Come on and get your overdose
Collect it at the borderline
And they want to get up in your head

'Cause they know, and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

The dawn to end all nights
That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
But to each his own
A soldier is bailing out
And curled his lips on the barrel
And I don't know if the dead can talk
To anyone

Did it all, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
She got no future, just a life to endure
This good samaritan is shaking her hand
Too late to leave here now, the songs in the can

Give it up, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

You call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony honor code
That put you on your throne
A double-standard you invoke when you want

Was it all for show?
Don't turn into one of them
Turning another page
Trust me darling
I'm carving a moat through the dust in your town
Crawling over the rubble
Just to serve you
Tend to wonder why
