I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me

Depression, please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh, please be done; how much longer can this drama afford to run?
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again

It hurts just to wake up, whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside, so tired of looking in
The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope

When I was a kid, I spent my Saturdays
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King, and I could feel the love

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things that I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to skydiver then
To survivor, dying to break down
A blood brother, surrogate mother
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
Locked in the attic, strung out, and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh-oh, but I made it alive
The sun starting to rise
Oh-oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh-oh, these are beautiful times!

This song could be about fighting depression, and the need to have others in your life to make it through rough times.
There were days when each hour
Was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares
And I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open
With a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark
And the fire brought me to life

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
Because there's no other way we can stay alive

Because we're burning bright as we all unite
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light
And though the embers are new, whatever you do
Just don't let the fire die

And you'll find, there'll be mornings
When the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion
And you'll never stop cause you know
Yeah you know it gets better
And your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow
