No nudes in my Snapchat, it's all alright
And uh, I bought the wrong hat, it wasn't a snapback, but yo, it's all alright
Cuz it's just clothes
It's funny how they gunning down niggas over Nikes
That's why I wear Vans, yeah looking tight ain't worth a nigga's life
And I know, and I know, it's not that serious
I don't need 23's on to feel superior
I'd still be happier
Yeah, I'd still be fine
Cuz without the hat or the shoes or the drop top coupe, dude I'm cool, I'm all alright

Still they find the time to always call me
Problems at the end of every hallway
I won't ever let it hurt or harm me
I'll be walking, head up, smiling always
Cloudy days don't ever bother me
Hating niggas never go to sleep
Busy trying to keep me up awake
Trying to keep a young'n from his dreams

The past is just a story we tell ourselves
Do you remember ours?
Tell me the story would you please?
Yeah, hey look the happy rapper's not so happy now
I remember when I used to laugh out loud
Nowadays I only LOL
Through text cause I don't wanna talk
Don't touch me I don't wanna feel
Rewrote this verse a couple times
First time I kept it way too real
Back before droppin "Keep It Real"
You really dropped me on my ass
I sent a hundred thousand text's
Don't think you ever sent one back
Let's backtrack back to twenty twelve
Packed our backpacks and hit the road
Felt like I died and went to heaven
My life at home was living hell
I told you, you was all I had
It's funny then you couldn't tell
When all your friends was talking shit
It's funny then you couldn't smell
It's funny then you couldn't spell
When I got no answers to those texts
These things get harder to forgive, and even harder to forget
But when I think about it, I'm kinda glad that you did
Don't try to eat with me now
You couldn't starve with me then
A couple months ago fuck
It was hard for us to be friends
Your heart is so much bigger ever since I made it big
Man that's weird
I said, you gon' remember me
