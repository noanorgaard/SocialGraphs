This summer's gonna hurt-

Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy, yeah
