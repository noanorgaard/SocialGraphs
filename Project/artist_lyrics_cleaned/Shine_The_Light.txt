Ready yourselves, ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night
Whoa, ready yourselves, ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise

Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voicеs in the wilderness, wе're crying out
And as the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Lord, let your sleeping giant rise
Catch the demons by surprise
Holy nation sanctified
Let this be our battle cry

Ready yourselves, ready yourselves
Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night
Whoa, ready yourselves, ready yourselves
May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise
You might also like
Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness, we're crying out
And as the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
We'll sing until the whole world hears
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
We'll sing until the whole world hears

I wanna be Your hands and feet
I wanna live a life that leads
To see You set the captive free
Until the whole world hears
And I pray that they will see
More of You and less of me
Lord, I want my life to be the song You sing

Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out
Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound
Like voices in the wilderness, we're crying out
And as the day draws near
We'll sing until the whole world hears
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
We'll sing until the whole world hears
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
We'll sing until the whole world hears
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
We'll sing until the whole world
