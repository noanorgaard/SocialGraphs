I see rivers fall into the sea
I see the mountains high
It's in my memory
Old house on the beach

Do you hear my song?
Flying like a snow white dove

We can still find ourselves

But roses in a garden don't impress them much
Because they're blind
Completely blind
The world around is full of broken hearts
But how to find the way to fix them all again
And where to find this perfect medicine
To cure our pain
To cure our pain

You know think there are never knew
