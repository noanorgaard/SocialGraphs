Take it back to the start
I've had a change of heart
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better

I know there's things to change, the path that I could choose is
Loose and I must find a new one
Our fates are not yet written, I will take the warning
Choose a way that's less destructive, -ive, -ive, -ive

Yeah, I know we look back, but we have only seen one path
Can't you see? We are free to choose our destiny
And be the way we want to be
A second chance, you just need to believe
You might also like
Believe, believe, believe, believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Believe, believe, believe, believe (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Believe, believe, believe, believe (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Take it back to the start
I've had a change of heart
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better

I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it better
I know we can make it better than it ever was
I know we can make it
