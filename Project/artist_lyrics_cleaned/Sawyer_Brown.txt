Now the race is on
And here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love
Never once suspectin' what the final result would be
And how I lived in fear of waking up each morning
Finding that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
