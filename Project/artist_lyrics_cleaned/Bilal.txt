It's all in her eyes, you and me
Words just disguise all the things that you be
What is deep? Steeper than steep
Soul only knows, this type of vibe gets stronger in time

Won't go on unnoticed, so concrete can't hold this
Hearts filled righteously
Whatever it is, I know that it's real
Long as you know, no complaints, you're all that I feel

Sista soul (You must be my soul sista, soul sista)
Sista soul (Hey sis, you must be my soul sista, soul sista)
Sista soul (Hey sis, you must be my soul sista)
Sista soul

You are so fine
Like spaces that fall in my soul, see, baby, that has no rhyme
Do you like how it feels when I smoke you out head down to your toes?
Making you, making you scream and shout
