You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call

Well, now momma, poppa told me, "Son, you better watch your step"
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my pop myself

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call

Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen-carat golden thing?

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, aw
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, aw
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly, dragon fly, get back to mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River
Well


Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world is smolderin'
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River"
Well

Hope you are quite prepared to die
