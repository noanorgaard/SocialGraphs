Cooler than Coolio, stay in that studio
Flyer than Peter Pan when I'm pushin' that Rufio
It's that Stone Mountain CEO, wishin' that you was me
Girls on the tour bus, keep that ratio two or three
Fly as I want, A-Town put 'em up
Eastside 'til I die, like we don't give a fuck
Keep your mouth so shut, talk is cheap
Bino been here, y'all been sleep
Bino hot and we know this
Fuck the rest, we've been chosen
Keepin' up with these Joneses
Still stunt with these hoes-es
So street like Elmo, so street like Elmo
Bino ain't the coldest? Man, you funny like my elbow
Always on some other shit, stupid like my type of rich
Damn, what kind of life is this? I'm driven like some licenses

Let their head nod when the beat go in
I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
You so sophisticated
Shout out to those who hated
Kill a rapper, try and spit at me, that's suicide
Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die
You might also like
I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
Kill a rapper; try and spit at me? That's suicide
Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die

Shotgun, blast that when I pass through
When I do things in that UK, and I fucks mane with that Flux mane
Bino flow so honest, your check ain't got no commas
But I ain't got no worries like Adele, my baby mama
Yeah, I'm blown off that Indo, blown off that Indo
Told y'all I would blow up, that shit happened like I said so
You see it, I got it, I want it, I buy it
I do it, you tryin', this yo' girl? You lyin'

Let their head nod when the beat go in
I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
You so sophisticated
Shout out to those who hated
Kill a rapper, try and spit at me, that's suicide
Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die

I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
I'mma wait 'til the beat go in
Let they head out when the beat go in
I'mma wait 'til the beat go 

Ain't this a pity, watchin' your pretty smile so warm
And I am already halfway out the door
And you’ll go and kiss me, say you were tipsy
Baby, I lose my cool
When I get emotional

I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional
I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional

You are detention after school
You are November in the swimmin' pool
A speeding car runnin' on fumes
We can drive just a little, drive just a little more
You are a trampoline with wings
We’re only jumpin' out of tendency
'Cause now we both need different things
So I’ll be cuttin' off these strings

Ain't this a pity, watchin' your pretty smile so warm
And I am already halfway out the door
And you’ll go and kiss me, say you were tipsy
Baby, I lose my cool
When I get emotional

I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional

We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get
