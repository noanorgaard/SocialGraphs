Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down)
Hey, I will stand my ground (Ooh)
And I won't back down

Well, I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down

Yeah, runnin' down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery
Goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I felt so good, like anything was possible
Hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
The last three days, the rain was unstoppable
It was always cold, no sunshine

Yeah, runnin' down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery
Goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I rolled on, the sky grew dark
I put the pedal down to make some time
There's somethin' good waitin' down this road
I'm pickin' up whatever is mine

I'm runnin' down a dream

Workin' on a mystery
Goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
Yeah, I'm runnin' down a dream

It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart

And I'm free
Free fallin'
Yeah, I'm free
Free fallin'

All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free
I'm free fallin'
Yeah, I'm free
Free fallin'

I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while
