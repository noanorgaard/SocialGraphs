Tell me where'd ya go when you said goodbye?
I never thought I'd lose you
Didn't think you would make a sacrifice
There was never any room to
Head for the road and live your life
And I'll read all the signs
Tell me where to go when the love has died

Midnight to sunrise, now I'm sitting at a red light
Anywhere but here, now I'm speeding
Memories I know will remain unknown

Hitchhiker, night-rider
Don't lose sight, top fighter
On this open road
Halfway to Mexico, halfway to Tokyo
On this open road
You've arrived
And I'm singing you the song on the west side
Halfway to Mexico, halfway to Tokyo
On the west side

Underneath the trees
Sitting here waiting for the mail on the weekend
Leaning with the breeze
I'm sitting here alone and I'm thinking
I'm not sorry
I won't apologize for my freedom

Midnight to sunrise, now I'm sitting at a red light
Anywhere but here, now I'm speeding
Memories I know will remain unknown

Hitchhiker, night-rider
Don't lose sight, top fighter
On this open road
Halfway to Mexico, halfway to Tokyo
On this open road
You've arrived
And I'm singing you the song on the west side
Halfway to Mexico, halfway to Tokyo
On the west
