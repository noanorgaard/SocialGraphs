What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
To keep going on home

Love, I gotta warn you
Starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth, I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)

G train on the weekend, hum and reload
A lullaby for the guy who fell down nearby cause he did a bit too much blow
G train on the weekend, just me and my head
Wondering why you deny my love when I keep on running back to your side
What am I doing this for?
I followed you to your door
I should've already known
To get going on home
You told me don't take it too fast
Cause you got an ugly past
I think I could help but you don't
Guess get going on home

Love, I gotta warn you
Starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)

I won’t, I won't wait here
I won't wait here for you
I won’t, I won't wait here
I won't wait here for you to get on board
 (x2)
Love, I gotta warn you
Starting to catch onto
What you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)
I've been losing patience
Your mind is always changing
Back and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)
I've been on a G train, in and out of Brooklyn
Come and let me love you, I could take you places
I've been on a G train, in and out of Brooklyn
Come and let me love you, I could take you 

What I heard 'round here confirmed my fear
You see yourself in my arms
But you won't get far, with my cold cold heart
Can't give you something I can't find

I've been searching for a feeling
Haven't found it yet
Hope I don't regret it
I've been searching for a feeling
I've got every reason to feel
Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
You might also like
You shouldn't be there
When I fall down
I can't say I'll do the same
You shouldn't tell me
I make you proud
I don't deserve any praise

I hang you dry, can't tell you why
I don't see myself in your arms
But you won't get far, with my cold, cold heart
Can't give you something I can't find

I've been searching for a feeling
Haven't found it yet
Hope I don't regret it
I've been searching for a feeling
I've got every reason to feel
Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
I've been searching (I've been searching)
I've been searching everywhere
I've been searching (I've been searching)
I've been searching
Oh I beg and plead that soon you'll leave
You'll be just as fucked up as me

I've been searching for a feeling
Haven't found it yet
Hope I don't regret it
I've been searching for a feeling
I've got every reason to feel
I've been searching for a feeling
Haven't found it yet
Hope I don't regret it (No)
I've been searching for a feeling
I've got every reason to feel
Oh, Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me, need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
Tell me you want me
Tell me you need me to love you
I've been searching everywhere
I've been searching for a feeling
Haven't found it yet
Hope I don't regret it
I've been searching for a feeling
I got every reason to 

I'm starting to feel
I've found something real
The thought of you fills me with
A warmth I've never known

Hold my heart 'til it grows old
Hold my heart 'til it grows old

Our love stays the same
Through time's endless change
I promise from now til' death
You'll never be alone

Hold my heart 'til it grows old
Hold my heart 'til it grows old
You might also like
Say you'll love me
Say you'll hold me
Through the stormy weather
We'll be together always
Say you'll love me
Say you'll hold me
Through the stormy weather
We'll be together always
Always, always

Hold my heart 'til it grows old (Hold my heart)
Hold my heart 'til it grows old
Hold my heart 'til it grows old
Hold my heart 'til it grows
