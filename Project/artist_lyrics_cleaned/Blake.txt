Drive on automatic
I flex out of habit
Dive in that pussy
And swim in it backwards
I tip but I’m laughin
They need target practice
I pop out the cut
And really let ‘em have it
Came through
Plottin on your bitch, real slick
Came through, creepin like this
Yuh, dumbass racks got ‘em sick
Leave me ‘lone, leave me 'lone stupid lil bitch
Aye, I bend her over, yeah over and over
My wrist is real sick
Like that bitch got pneumonia
I don’t speak too often
My cash do the talkin
And you broke as fuck, so, um
I beg your pardon?
Damn, I’m in LA blowin cookie
My nigga don’t push me
Do not overlook me
Look at this stack
No, I am no rookie
Anything less than a 20 I’m pussy
She said she needed that dick and it fat
Came through, real quick
And I was dressed in all black
Fuckin that bitch
And I hit from the back
Fuckin that bitch
And I don’t hit her back
Damn, break a bitch down with the dick
Damn, bring it back with a sneak diss
Damn, you was focused on the wrong shit
That’s the reason why you still a broke bitch
Somebody come get these niggas away from me
Please tell these niggas to leave me alone
How did this nigga end up in my phone
Stop telling my nigga
To show me your song
Went to the jeweler
And I copped that water
Put that in my ear
That shit cost me 3k
I fell in love with them diamonds
Went back to the jeweler
And spent 7 racks in a day
Them Cubic Zirconia
These here VVS
Got two iPhone 7’s
Still can’t read a message
Ridin with work
And a couple of weapons
12 get behind us
We cool, calm, collected
She want to lay up and be cute
I told that lil bitch
I ain’t got not one minute to cuddle
I spend these stacks
Make it back, watch it double
Just busted a nut
Hate to bust your bubble
See BLAKE LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like

Thousand lil haters on my nuts

They don’t want to see me power up
You a broke nigga shut the fuck
Slide on the dick like a Visa
Let me borrow that bitch
You can keep her
Rollin off that gas
I’m a geeker
Rollin off that gas
I’m a geeker
Nigga how I’m livin
Pappadeaux Mardi Gras pasta and chicken
You was on instagram chasin broke bitches
Listen, that’s why you still in your position
Really bout to drop 10 racks on a pendant
If she got that water
Best believe I’m gon' swim it
I ain’t have no time for pussy in a lil minute
You a broke nigga
We ain’t in the same sentence
Why you always got somethin to say
Move your broke ass out the way
Why these niggas want to hate on lil Blake
Same niggas be the ones in my face
I put my foot on the gas

You get that check, they get mad
Never will I come in last
