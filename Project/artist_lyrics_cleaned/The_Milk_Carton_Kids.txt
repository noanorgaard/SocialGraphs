So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts, you'll know it's the right thing

Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands where I could see 'em
You took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you

And all that's left is a blind reflection
But you know what's coming and you regret it

So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts most it's the right thing
