Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white T-shirt
Breaker, breaker 1-9, she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose

In like Flynn, I was
Looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey
Baby, where you been
All my life I've been looking for
Someone like you
Falling head over heels
Hey, what can I do
You might also like
Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white T-shirt
Breaker, breaker 1-9, she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose

Now I'm in the fast lane, going 98
By now I know she can
Smooth operate me
I know now, she's no goody-two-shoes
But hey, I got myself nothin' to lose

Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white T-shirt
Breaker, breaker 1-9, she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose
Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rolling in dirt in a white T-shirt
Breaker, breaker 1-9, she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, any way I choose
I got nothin' to lose
Noon time, down time, break time
Summertime, Miller Time, any time
She was looking pretty fine
In like Flynn I was looking for the win
Just trying anything, hey baby where you been
All my life I been looking for someone like you
Falling head over heels hey what can I do
I got nothin' to lose,
