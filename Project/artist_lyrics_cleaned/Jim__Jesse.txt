Let's set this straight
Yes I called you the GOAT cause when you move you don't hesitate
I've been here for the Dodge emblems
The Craftsmen jeans, how you got to Mook and then levitate
I don't know a lot about antonyms and synonyms but I know how to shoot when the weapon straight
And I know a lot about homonyms so I can't let you resume with this resume
You finna die indeed
Aye Smack, if this ya brother, advise him please
Pine boxes don't come from the finest trees
And since he rich, you get high quality
Red-ish brown wood; mahogany
Hand crafted in South America, you don't wanna see a guy in these (Guyanese)
Fire please!
If I burn his house down, who gon' be your face when ya man die Troy?
Pour gasoline '(Lean) Wit' It, Roc(k) Wit' It' there goes your Franchise Boy!
{Twork jumps in the crowd}
Hand my toy
I'm finna clip this nigga up
You said, "D-Nanny" for "DNA in New York"
That shit was iffy bruh, listen up
I'll show you how to split the states and cities up
Cause that ain't go over or land though (Orlando) like you went to Disney bruh
I don't wanna see you now or again (Oregon), I suggest the niggas wit' you duck (Duck)
You go to police, it goes South, the code of (South Dakota) the streets take ya lips and zip 'em up
I went to his home in Baltimore, the nigga think he big and tough
When he see his daughter on the floor it'll (Florida) switch his feelings up
On my waist is where the cans is (Kansas) and if I lift these pistols up
I shoot his baby boy crib, I won't even miss his sippy (Mississippi) cup
I'm 'bout to clip this nigga up
Put ya boy up in a ditch
Bang bang, that's the sound of ya shorty gettin' hit
Bang bang, that's the sound of the war, we in the mix
He can't buckle up, his seatbelt won't work
Bang bang, that's the sound of the .40 on my hip
And this a new car, so if you don't buckle up, you gon' keep hearin' that noise until it click
I get noisy with this bitch
100 round out the TEC I'm firin'
I'm 'bout to send you up to Heaven flyin'
You 'bout to find out how beautiful God is like Aphrodite
Hey Smack, if this ya gunner, you should've gave him better guidance
He should've never tried this
If he don't die, he gon' leave here in liver failure like hepatitis
If I have to find him, I'ma grab the toaster
I'm outside with the ratchet blowin'
Boom boom, I shoot the door until the latch is broken
Boom
"HEY ROC!"
He in the bed restin', I flip the mattress over
Now he can sleep upside down just like a bat suppose to
I'ma clap the toaster
I'm holdin' the fifth
I see Caution, I say, "Bitch you better not open ya lips"
I'm pretty cautious, gloves on so they don't notice the prints
Red Lobster, I even put the tape over the grip
Like, "Where the coke and the piff?"
If I clip you up, that wasn't Roc, I really had rocks, I'm talkin' zips and up
Methamphetamines, oxycodone, prescription drugs
Back in my heyday, I would've had Caution samplin', pass yo' bitch the blunt
Whole dip of stuff
Like, "This the stuff"
Let her test the boat out, make your missus Puff (Mrs. Puff)
I got yo' bitch on cuff
She talk crazy, but she follow the plans though
Police pull us over, Big Bad Wolf, she gon' swallow the grams whole
Can' blow, get ya pals dumped on
Oh that's a vest? Teflon? That's just gon' get me riled up more
Cause dome shots the only thing my pound bust for
Better hope that's what your foreheads (four heads) made outta Roc(k) like Mount Rushmore
Dump on 'em, you might get killed
Say somethin' I don't like for real
You gon' die for real
We goin' outside for a single file (foul) line like a fire drill
I'm Strapped In!!
I'll clap you in a coma
Madness
I could snap at any moment
Your life is over, you might not quite deserve it
But a kind soul won't do you no good, once I light ya- this might get personal
Everybody duck cause this rifle burstin'
It might split Drake head wide open, just like the Sprite commercial
When they ask who's the king, I'm the rightful person
It's time to steal the torch
I was outside with the fans, I'm the one they feel for sure
I went to the small league events, I gave 'em real support
I got PG's in the buildin', you try to seal the door
I even stopped them Crucible niggas from havin' to deal with Norbes
I took off the hood, I jumped over Suge
I'm the most creative
I went on strike when you said you wasn't earnin' paper
When Smack had yo' pockets tapped, who returned the favor?
I 'Started From The Bottom', no entourage, I was comin' six deep (6 deep)
Still the most imitated, I'm the reason K-Shine went on a 20 win streak
I'm the streets
Pray to me, I'm the synagogue
When it come to battle rap, I'm exactly what it epitomize
Nigga I'm Smack gunner, it's time to wear that shit with pride
Let's turn Real Nigga Time into the Bigga .9
Baow Baow Baow!
Nigga died, I shot him in a jiffy
Hit his noggin with a .50
French blunderbuss, take an oval off his head (Oval Office head) like Monica Lewinsky
Clipped him, you gon' move out the burbs
I'm 'bout to take this one to the grave, you got my word
Drive-by, chopper out the GMC I'll shoot out the burg
K clip, press down on a half moon
(Do not disturb!)
That was mean Twork
And now I got a body on a half moon like DreamWorks
You be talkin' often
Nigga you soft as cotton
Wait 'til ya gang get around and be talkin' often
I'ma wait 'til them niggas leave and spark it on you
Squid Games
By the time they come back Roc(k)'s in the bag, he done lost his marbles
Jersey!

Ay yo!
I ain't gon' lie, this nigga's my friend
How about I get my kids you get ya kids we hit the beach and we can get 'em to swim?
Nah, I'ma drive us all to a cliff and let the sinnin' begin
I'ma let our Child's Play but I'ma push my friend to the end
I really am him
You, were not the first to be copied, I've been cloned
I faced all the writers that been known
Y'all Champion Of The Year, yeah, y'all see how I did Jones
This nigga from the Cave knocked over more pens (pins) than Fred Flintstone
I have to be the master
Eazy, he the Captain of the trappers
As far as Chess? He actually will clap ya
Surf? I get to passin' him a ladder
And have Tsunami hit Jerusalem, that's a natural disaster
I'm uncontrollable
And I don't do what I'm told to do
Unload on you
Then trash cans; disposable
Rifle, from the Civil War, put a hole in you
Like Back II The Future, I will bring something old to Nu (new)
Cannon wit' me, blam the semi, 'til this can' is empty
With ya life, you're gamblin' Jerzey (gamble in Jersey); Atlantic City
This man get busy
Mini chopper mounted
That mean the Drac' posted on the wall like a fan of Drizzy
Stop playin' wit' me
I don't follow by the rules, I gotta lot of goons
Them niggas ain't got a lot to lose
I got a lot of tools
This a chopper not an Uz'
This'll knock Nu (New) Balance off, send him flyin' out his shoes
Ratchet dirty
Soon as he turn around, clap the .30
NBA protest, that's a piece (peace) to the back of Jerzey (jersey)
I'm a hunter, preserve the kill if the catch is worthy
Hang his head up on the wall; taxidermy
Who believe in him?
If the ambulance comin', bitch you needin' 'em
They know not to gas me up, I use premium
Chop off a limb, mail it to ya mom
I get unique wit' 'em
Foot Locker, I send her home a box with Nu (new) feet in 'em
The can' erupt, blam shit up
It's like bowlin' after we done rollin', there won't be much left standin' up
I don't care if this TEC jam or what
Stab his side, get to ribbin' (ribbon) on Jerzey (jersey) it's Breast Cancer Month
Poof
Magically, appears a Nina
They hear this steamer
It'll go from this shit bein' packed to a clear arena
Jakk better not try to be no hero either
I'ma bomb through him then drop Nu clear (nuclear); Hiroshima
Kill his leader, hollow tips what this clip contain
Turn him to a memory inside of a picture frame
Up close or long distance aim
Don't matter, arms on Jerzey (jersey), NBA Christmas game
I lift and bang
Your vocal cords will get shot
Your voice? Over, like them videos on Tik Tok
I don't believe that ya clique pop
Bitch stop
All that tough talk, I ain't buyin' that Nu (new); thrift shop
Make ya strip hot
This shit drop whoever not in the family
Shreddin' niggas; Edward Scissors, the chop is handy
We get the drop then we slide in the Camry
Huge shotty, I will get Nu (new) bodied (Body); Dr. Miami
To these fans, you the wild Blood, the big bully
But to me, you just lil' bruh, a kid to me
You heard right, I poke this knife in his left, turn right
Drive it straight up the middle of Jerzey (Jersey); turnpike
You'se a termite
I earned my position, you will get murked if I'm trippin'
I will let every round burst from my Smith &
You fuck around and be a hurt opposition
Left there, shakin', with a wet t-shirt
Who said Twork (twerk) competition?
You ain't ask the culture
I'm mad that I had to smoke ya
Everybody, Jerzey (jersey) in a bag; practice over
I tried to tell him that this ain't what he want from me
Battle rap is not a job to me this shit is fun to me
Fuck a scheme, angle, punch, it's 'bout a gun to me
The gun is the only thing that get the job done for
