And if you do me right, I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight, I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind, there will be time for that too
If you hang with me

Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me
'Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree
Oh-whoa, you can hang with me

When you see me drift astray
Out of touch and out of place
Will you tell me to my face?
Then I guess you can hang with me

I just gotta see it for myself
