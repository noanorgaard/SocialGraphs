I hate it when my friends fall down
It's like they're living in the clouds
If they fall into the pool, they'll drown
I can't get nothing done right now

'Cause all my friends are high
(All my friends are high)
Oh, all my friends are high
I'm not gonna lie
(I'm not gonna lie)
All my friends are high

I think they're getting hungry
'Cause AJ's got the munchies
He wants Jack-in-the-Box tacos
He says they're super crunchy
I think that we should hide
'Cause the police are coming
I forgot what I was saying
But I know I should say something so
