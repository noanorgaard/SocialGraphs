Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
Then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

There's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-nappin' on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
I'll steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah
Oh, new believers gettin' baptized
Mama's hands raised up high
Havin' a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday (Sunday), oh yeah

That's what I love about Sunday (Sunday), oh 

Come on in, the water's fine
Just idle on over and toss us a line

Bass-trackers, Bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Uh, anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

Bermuda's, flip-flops, and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around

We'll be makin' waves in a no-wake zone

I'm a God-fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug-a-lug-a-luggin' five miles an hour
On my International Harvester

Uh, three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Off late to work, road rage jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
Flippin' me the bird
Well, you may be on a state-paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this here ain't been no bumper crop
If you don't like the way I'ma drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise, sit tight and be nice
And quit your honkin' at me that way

I'm the son of a third-generation farmer
I've been married ten years to a farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the FFA, ayy
That's what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' at me won't save you no time, hoss
Now, this big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor
