REY
FINN Good shooting! Thanks! I--
Now that was some I don't know! -- I've
Flying! How did you flown some ships but I've
Do that?! No one never left the planet!
Trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead
That was amazing! on. You got him with one
(beat) blast!
You set me up for it! (laughs)
(cocky) It was perfect!
That was pretty good
They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced in joy and camaraderie
Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels
REY (CONT'D)
You're ok. He's with the Resistance
He's going to get you home. We both will
(TO FINN)
I don't know your name
FINN
Finn. What's yours
REY
I'm Rey
BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile
FINN
Rey...
But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,     STEAM BURSTS from under the grating
REY
Help me with this! Quick!
They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
Over, watches
FINN
Whoa! What's going on?
She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern
EXT. SPACE - DAY
The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY
Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
Star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task
LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku
Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter
KYLO REN
The droid... stole a freighter?
LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Not exactly, sir. It had help
Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape--
Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing  scars
KYLO REN
Anything else?
Mitaka hates to say the following, but:
LIEUTENANT MITAKA
The two were accompanied by a girl
Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove:
KYLO REN
What girl?
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY
Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by
STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES
REY
It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there!
As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below
Overwhelmed by the technical issues --
FINN
How bad is it?!
REY
If we wanna live, not good!
BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:
FINN
They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system!
Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench
REY
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" --
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!
FINN
(Throws a tool)
This?
She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:
FINN (CONT'D)
You gotta tell us where the base is
(BB-8 BEEPS)
I don't speak that. Alright,between us,I'm not with the Resistance,OK?
(BB-8 backs up)
-- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there
First -- deal?!
(BB-8 COCKS his head)
Droid, please
Rey pops up again:
REY
Pilex driver, hurry!
Finn moves for the tool
REY (CONT'D)
So where's your base?
FINN
(searching, to BB-8)
Go on BB-8, tell her
(QUIETLY)
Please!
She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
Situation, then BEEPS
REY
The Ileenium system?
Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again.
FINN
Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can.
A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.
REY
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.I need the bonding tape, hurry!
FINN
(searching for tape)
What about you?
REY
I gotta get back to Jakku!
FINN
(loses his mind)
BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
REY
No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas!
Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool
He throws her the tape, she disappears below:
FINN
This?
REY
Yes!
FINN
Hey. Rey. You're a pilot – you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?
The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:
REY
None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous

FINN
... That can't be good
REY
(HEADS OFF)
-- No it can't be --
FINN FOLLOWS REY TO:
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
They plop into the seats, in a panic. She checks the dead INSTRUMENTATION PANEL:
REY
Someone's locked onto us – all controls are overridden
Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out
REY (CONT'D)
Get off. Get off! See anything?
FINN
... Oh no
EXT. SPACE - DAY
The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck
SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE!
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified.
FINN
It's the First Order.
REY
What do we do-- there must be SOMETHING --
Finn's mind races -- then:
FINN
You said poisonous gas --
REY
-- Yeah, but I fixed that --
FINN
Can you unfix it?
Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY
The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED.
Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open grating area.
REY
C'mon BB-8,
They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he  weighs a TON.
FINN
I got it.
REY
Oooh...
FINN
I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...
UNDER THE GRATING
Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls.
REY
You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?
FINN
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins.
LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:
FINN (CONT'D)
Hurry!
REY
I'm hurrying!
Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS – AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only.
HAN
Chewie, we're home!
Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.They're SCARED.
HAN (CONT'D)
Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
REY
...I'm the pilot...
HAN
You?
Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --
REY
No, it's true: we're the only ones on board.
FINN
You can understand that thing?
HAN
And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there!
They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out.
HAN (CONT'D)
Where'd you get this ship?
REY
Niima Outpost.
HAN
Jakku?! That junkyard?
FINN
Thank you! Junkyard!
HAN
(TO CHEWIE)
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches!
(TO REY)
Who had it, Ducain?
REY
I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who  stole it from Ducain
HAN
Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.
Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.
REY
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
HAN
I used to be.
FINN
Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
REY
No, the smuggler!
FINN
(TO CHEWIE)
Wasn't he a war hero?!
Chewie replies: "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out:
REY
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME
Han enters the cockpit
HAN
Twelve! Fourteen...
A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS HIM:
HAN (CONT'D)
Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line!
Han moves to the corridor.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY
REY
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on THE HYPERDRIVE--
HAN
(OVERLAPPING HER)
-- Stress on the hyperdrive--
(who is she? Then:)
Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet
REY
Wait! No -- we need your help!
HAN
My help?
REY
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
FINN
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker
Yup: Han stops in his tracks.
FINN (CONT'D)
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him?
The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn
HAN
Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke
Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!
HAN (CONT'D)
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten LOOSE--
Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:
FINN
Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY
The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Hanoves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him
FINN
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
HAN
I'm hauling Rathtars.
On the CONTROL PANEL:IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP.Including the EXTERIOR,where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER.Han is fearful.
HAN (CONT'D)
Oh great. It's the Guavian Death  Gang -- they must've tracked us from  Nantoon.
Han heads off as:
REY
What's a Rathtar?
INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY
Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo containers
HAN
They're big and dangerous...
FINN
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
REY
No.
FINN
Good.
They turn a corner:
HAN
I got three of 'em going to King Prana.
FINN
THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
HAN
I used to have a bigger crew.
Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring
CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND CO. ARE THERE
HAN
Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.
REY
What about BB-8?
HAN
He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.
FINN
What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them?
A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS Into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops.
HAN
There's one.
REY
What are you gonna do?
HAN
Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it
(CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
Yes, I do. Every time
INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY
A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in A SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet away in the middle of the long hall.
BALA-TIK
Han Solo. You are a dead man.
Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back and forth at the gang, and Han.
HAN
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
BALA-TIK
The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY
They look up, trying to get a view
REY
Can you see them?
FINN
No.
They start crawling down the crawl space.
BALA-TIK
I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub.
HAN
You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other?
Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:
REY
They have blasters...
FINN
A lot of 'em
We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance
BALA-TIK
The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We our money back now
HAN
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
BALA-TIK
Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.
HAN
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
BALA-TIK
Tell that to Kanjiklub!
SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING.Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR,where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR.A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style. Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:
HAN
Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:
TASU LEECH
Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you
Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous
Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them
HAN
Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever
Not delivered for you before?
BALA-TIK
Yeah
TASU LEECH
Twice!
Han realizes he's right
HAN
What was the second time?
BALA-TIK
Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle
TASU LEECH
Nowhere left for you to hide
BALA-TIK
That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives
Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble
HAN
First I've heard of it
Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):
RAZOO QIN-FEE
Search the freighter!
One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor
AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at A JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.
REY
Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!
FINN
Close the blast doors from here?
REY
Resetting the fuses should do it
Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad.QUIETLY:
HAN
... I got a bad feeling about this...
Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below
Where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned
REY
Oh no!
FINN
Oh no, what?
REY
(PALE)
Wrong fuses...
IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:
BALA-TIK
Kill them! And take the droid!
The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY!The gang turns--others run,FIRE AT IT
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY
Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep steppin....
INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY
Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks
FINN
This was a mistake!
REY
Huge!
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY
Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship – passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, quickly.  They turn a corridor --
REY
What do they look like?
Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH
FINN
They look like that
Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a
RATHTAR IS THERE!
FINN (CONT'D)
This way!
REY
Are you sure?
They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY FAST!
REY (CONT'D)
FINN!
But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --
FINN
REY!
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY
TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose!
Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen
REY
FINN!!!!
Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --           and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then
SLAMS THE BUTTON!
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY
The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg! Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
Adrenaline-rushed, in shock:
REY
Finn!
FINN
It had me! But the door--!
REY
That was lucky!
ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY
Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE With GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL
HAN
I got the door. Cover us!
Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls
THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a LOUD GROAN!
HAN (CONT'D)
Chewie! You okay?
Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS, BADASS!
HAN (CONT'D)
(looks at bowcaster)
Wow. Come on! Come on!
INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY
Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
The Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them
REY
Han!
Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
Says to Rey:
HAN
You, close the door behind us!
(TO FINN)
You take care of Chewie!
Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie
Who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
Fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat
HAN
Hey, where are you going?
REY
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
HAN
I hate that guy!
Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:
REY
And you could use a co-pilot.
HAN
I got one, he's back there
IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN --
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Han and Rey in the seats:
HAN
Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --
REY
(SHOCKED)
From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?
HAN
I never ask that question until after I've done it
A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:
HAN (CONT'D)
This is not how I thought this day  was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there!
IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --
FINN
(HUGE PROBLEM)
No problem!
INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY
Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
HAN
Come on baby, don't let me down!
He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.
HAN (CONT'D)
What?!
But Rey reaches over, points to a switch, matter-of-factly.
REY
Compressor.
Han doesn't like it but she's right--he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES!The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES.In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:
EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY
Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving the cargo ship behind.
INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY
PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,  SEETHING. Makes a CALL:
BALA-TIK
Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's  aboard the Millennium Falcon.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET
Frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
That has been hacked and modified into something sinister. Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power:
SNOKE (V.O.)
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at  someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME   LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five  feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile  powerful, all at the same time
SNOKE
...Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.
GENERAL HUX
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th--
SNOKE
General! Our strategy must now change.
GENERAL HUX
The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be , and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.
Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:
SNOKE
Go. Oversee preparations.
GENERAL HUX
Yes, Supreme Leader!
General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.
SNOKE
There's been an awakening. Have you felt it?
KYLO REN
Yes.
SNOKE
There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium  Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo.
Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.
KYLO REN
He means nothing to me.
SNOKE
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.
KYLO REN
(STEELY RESOLVE)
By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.
SNOKE
We shall see. We shall see...
A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed
Filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
Evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
A HOLOGRAM all along.
EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY
RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY
CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. SPARKS!
HAN
Electrical overload!
REY
I can fix that!
HAN
The coolant's leaking!
REY
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--
HAN
-- Secondary tank, I got it!
INT. LOUNGE:
CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off...
FINN
Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!
INT. FALCON COCKPIT:
HAN
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
INT. LOUNGE:
As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee:
FINN
Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times!
(Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS)
Which is fine...
INT. FALCON COCKPIT:
HAN
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems!
Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.
HAN (CONT'D)
What'd you do?
REY
I by-passed the compressor.
He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits walking past BB-8.
HAN
Move, Ball.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY
Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
Checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.
HAN
Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest.
Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside  him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:
HAN (CONT'D)
Good job, kid. And thanks.
FINN
You're welcome.
Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.
HAN
So, fugitives, huh?
REY
The First Order wants the map.
(re: Finn and BB-8)
Finn is with the Resistance...
(SHRUGS)
... I'm just a scavenger.
Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
To TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.
HAN
Let's see whatcha got.
REY
(TO BB-8)
Go ahead.
BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC
MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS. They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through stars, becomes reflective.
HAN
This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
REY
Why'd he leave?
HAN
He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke  felt responsible... He walked away from everything.
FINN
Do you know what happened to him?
HAN
There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi Temple.
REY
The Jedi were real?
HAN
I used to wonder that myself. Thought  it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.
(BEAT)
'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.
An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises and moans to Han,but Han motions for Chewie to lay back DOWN:
HAN (CONT'D)
No, you rest
(To Rey and Finn)
You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.
Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.
EXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY
BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot
Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears.
REY
(QUIETLY)
...I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy...
Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.
EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY
The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN smallish freighters
EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side
She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side
LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY
From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages
Retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned
FINN
Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --
HAN
D'you just call me "Solo"?
FINN
Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?
HAN
Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out  the truth.
Hands him a BLASTER.
HAN (CONT'D)
Always.
Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she looks at the castle.
HAN
You might need this.
REY
I think I can handle myself
HAN
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it
Rey picks it up. Grips it
HAN (CONT'D)
You know how to use one of these?
REY
Yeah, you pull the trigger.
HAN
There's a little bit more to it than  that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
REY
Rey.
HAN
Rey. I've been thinkin' about  bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out.  Someone who can keep up with Chewie    and me, appreciates the Falcon.
REY
Are you offering me a job?
HAN
I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
REY
You're offering me a job.
HAN
I'm thinking about it.
Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.
HAN (CONT'D)
Well?
REY
If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.
Han looks at her, questioningly.
HAN
Jakku?
Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.
REY
(BEAT)
I've already been away too long.
HAN
(TO CHEWIE)
Chewie, check out the ship as best you can.
HAN (CONT'D)
It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.
Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
Han walks them to the castle.
FINN
Solo, why are we here again?
HAN
To get your droid on a clean ship.
REY
Clean?
HAN
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.
FINN
We can trust her, right?
HAN
Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...
REY AND FINN
At what?
HAN
Any of it
The door opens. Music. Madness. And...
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY
We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who  suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA.
MAZ
Han Solo!
Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here
HAN
(Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)Hey, Maz!
NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away
MAZ
Where's my boyfriend?
HAN
Chewie's working on the Falcon.
MAZ
I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something.Desperately. Let's get to it.
Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a Small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.
GA-97
Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here!
And we CUT TO:
IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
Communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:
BAZINE
Inform the First Order... I've found the droid
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.
INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY
A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.
KYLO REN
Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader
Senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me,    Grandfather, and I will finish what you started .
As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off--we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to:THE BURNT ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER
CUT TO:
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY
Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:
MAZ
A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess
HAN
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia
MAZ
Hmm. No. You've been running away this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
HAN
Leia doesn't want to see me
FINN
Please, we came here for your help
REY
What fight?
MAZ
The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us...
FINN
There is no fight against the First  Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right--
Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE
FINN (CONT'D)
What's this? What are you doing?
Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
Tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn
FINN (CONT'D)
Solo, what is she doing?
HAN
I don't know, but it ain't good.
MAZ
If you live long enough you see the  same eyes in different people. I'm at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
FINN
(eyes on Maz)
You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like  I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.
Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her  chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.
MAZ
You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear.
Finn sees them. Considers.
REY
Finn!
FINN
Come with me.
REY
What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
FINN
I can't...
Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.
HAN
Keep it, kid.
Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.
MAZ
Who's the girl?
FINN has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.
FINN
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim.
Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.
REY
What are you doing?
Finn gets up to talk to her.
FINN
(to Big Head)
Don't leave without me.
Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.
REY
You can't just go. I won't let you.
FINN
I'm not who you think I am.
REY
Finn, what are you talking about?
FINN
I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.
(STOPS HER)
Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing...
(EMOTIONAL)
But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran...
FINN (CONT'D)
Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.
REY
Don't go.
FINN
Take care of yourself. Please.
Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation,Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off.He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time.
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters.
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room.Old trea-sures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside. The box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment heavy with tension. Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original   lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.
YOUNG GIRL
NO!
She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to:
R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND
We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what sh esees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see...
A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical
Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her
YOUNG GIRL
No, come back!
UNKAR PLUTT
Quiet, girl!
The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
Eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is...
In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
Seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. She HEARS something and turns to look. Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened.
REY
What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
MAZ
That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you!
REY
I have to get back to Jakku.
MAZ
Han told me.
(reaches out, hold REY'S HAND)
Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could.
REY
Luke
MAZ
The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi. But I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it
Rey suddenly stands
REY
I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this.
And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. Heads toward the woods.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to come.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS, OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous  SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:
GENERAL HUX
Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while  secretly supporting the treachery of  the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon            which we stand, will bring an end to  the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this...as the last day of the Republic!
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of  nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
GENERAL HUX
FIRE!
And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a  ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily
SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC  BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO  THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!   The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the   FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES! For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!   Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.  Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS eyes, CUT TO:
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY
TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing
EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY
Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood runs cold, his heart sinks.
EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT
At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL  SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST   FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!
EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT
The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive    structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING -- FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN  APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING  NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY
A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up
FINN (O.S.)
It was the Republic.
Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread:
FINN (CONT'D)
The First Order, they've done it.  Where's Rey?
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.
REY
What are you doing?
(HE BEEPS)
You have to go back.
(he BEEPS again)
BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you.
Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:
MAZ
I've had this for ages...
MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:
MAZ
Kept it locked away
HAN
Where'd you get that?
MAZ
A good question for another time
(TO FINN)
Take it! Find your friend!
Finn grabs it as the room's SHAKEN by an above ground attack
MAZ (CONT'D)
Those beasts! They're here!
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle – BEING DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING  OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack. Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!
STORMTROOPER
FN-417, hold position!
Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes:
REY
Safety!
SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers!
EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY
Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS.Stormtrooper approaches:
STORMTROOPER #4
Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl.
Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:
REY
You have to keep going, stay out of sight,I'll try to fight 'em off.
(BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear)
I hope so, too.
BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --
EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY
Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris.
HAN
Come on, Chewie!
Maz turns to Finn:
MAZ
Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go.
FINN
I need a weapon.
Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.
MAZ
You have one!
He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
Lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out!
HAN
Hey, can I try that?
Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
And sends them flying
HAN (CONT'D)
(TO CHEWBACCA)
I like this thing
FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
Stormtrooper has a MACE --
STORMTROOPER
Traitor!
FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!Han helps him up.
HAN
You okay, Big deal?
FINN
Thanks!
But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE,BLASTERS AIMED.
STORMTROOPER
Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!
No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE FIRST ORDER SHIPS!
PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS
STORMTROOPER (CONT'D)
We have incoming at two-eight-point-Six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position!
HAN
It's the Resistance!
One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!
INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY
It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing
POE
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!
JESS (V.O.)
Copy that!
SNAP (V.O.)
We're with you, Poe!
The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT UP
HAN
Quick!
Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster.Shoots a Trooper
FINN
Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!
INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY
POE
WOOHOO!
EXT. FOREST - DAY
In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
Aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer and then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and Again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO DEFLECT EVERY BLAST. She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE
KYLO REN
The girl I've heard so much about
He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
The droid
He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS
HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
Where is it?
WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE
STORMTROOPER
Request air support!
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
A beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand
She is relieved but still afraid
KYLO REN
The map. You've seen it
Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
Stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods
STORMTROOPER #5
Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops
Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face
KYLO REN
Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need
A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS FROM FRAME!
EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY
The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING Another TIE Fighter! On the ground:
STORMTROOPER
Pull back the tree line!
Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle
Han is ROCKED
FINN
NO!! REY!!!
Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:
FINN (CONT'D)
No, no, no, no... REY!!
In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive...
EXT. FOREST - DAY
BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
Ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads BACK FOR THE CASTLE
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY
Post battle. Finn runs to Han:
FINN
He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
HAN
(WALKS PAST)
Yeah, yeah, I know...
And he and Chewie head off.
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY
Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris; BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport
ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen
Finally, the transport door opens and standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and embers, no one says a word.
Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:
C-3PO
Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-Threepio!
(sees Han, stops)
You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm
(sees Leia, INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly
(BB-8 BEEPS)
Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled.
He hurries off. Finally, alone again.
HAN
You changed your hair.
LEIA
Same jacket.
HAN
No, new jacket.
Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
A few words, looks at Han then boards the ship; It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:
HAN (CONT'D)
... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here.
Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke.
EXT. SPACE - DAY
The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS. This is D'QAR.
EXT. D'QAR - DAY
The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken structures.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,  a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off...
IT IS POE!
Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the Droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
Believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.
FINN
Poe. Poe Dameron!
They move to each other -- and embrace.
FINN (CONT'D)
You're alive!
POE
So are you!
FINN
What happened to you?
POE
What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing--
BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.
POE (CONT'D)
BB-8 says that you saved him.
FINN
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
POE
You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?
FINN
(starting to remove it)Oh here.
POE
No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
FINN
Poe -- I need your help.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
Command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
Arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:
POE
General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to YOU --
LEIA
(takes Finn's hand)
And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --
FINN
(surprised she knows)
Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--
LEIA
Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry
Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:
POE
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
LEIA
We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
FINN
That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.
LEIA
And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. DR. KALONIA uses a
Device to help heal his shoulder. Chewie TALKS.
DR. KALONIA
(CHEWIE TALKS)
That sounds very scary.
(CHEWIE TALKS)
You must be so brave.
Chewie agrees.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a
BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.
C-3PO
General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse: It matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
LEIA
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
HAN
Leia...
LEIA
Don't do that.
HAN
Do what?
She heads off.
LEIA
Anything!
Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.
C-3PO
Princesses.
Han follows Leia across the base floor:
HAN
I'm trying to be helpful!
LEIA
When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star!
HAN
(SIGHS)
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
Dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. Then:
C-3PO (O.S.)
BB-8. You're wasting your time.
BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.
(BB-8 BEEPS)
I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns
HAN
Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.
LEIA
You think I want to forget him? I want him back!
Han looks at her with sympathy.
HAN
There was nothing we could've done.
(hard for him to say)
There was too much Vader in him.
LEIA
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
HAN
We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only  thing I was ever good at
LEIA
We both did.
HAN
We lost our son, forever.
LEIA
No.
(LONG BEAT)
It was Snoke.
Han takes this in.
LEIA (CONT'D)
He seduced our son to the dark side.But we can still save him. Me. You.
HAN
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?
LEIA
Luke is a Jedi-you're his father.There's still light in him.I know it
GENERAL STATURA
General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there.
REY
Where am I?
KYLO REN
(LONG BEAT)
You're my guest.
REY
Where are the others?
KYLO REN
You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends?
(Rey stares at him)
You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.
Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You still want to kill me.
REY
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.
Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance
KYLO REN
Tell me about the droid.
REY
(a nervous beat)
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
KYLO REN
He's carrying a section of a  navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece.  And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger--
Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You know I can take whatever I want.
Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave...
(then, slight smile)
At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island...
Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
And Han Solo. You feel like he's  the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.
His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:
REY
-- Get out of my head --
But this just makes Kylo lean closer
KYLO REN
I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.
Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:
REY
I'm not giving you anything!
KYLO REN
We'll see.
He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --
DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass...
AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!
REY
... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader!
KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:
SNOKE (V.O.)
This scavenger, resisted you?
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke
KYLO REN
She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows
And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:
SNOKE
And the droid?
Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:
GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us
Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren
GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already
Snoke is visibly furious
SNOKE
Then the Resistance must be destroyed  before they get to Skywalker
GENERAL HUX
We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system
SNOKE
Good. Then we will crush them once
And for all. Prepare the weapon
Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant  at all --
KYLO REN
Supreme Leader. I can get the map
From the girl. I just need your guidance
SNOKE
If what you say about this girl is
True, bring her to me
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an   intense beat. Then says:
REY
You will remove these restraints  and leave this cell, with the door open.
The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.
TROOPER GUARD #2
What did you say?
Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:
REY
You will remove these restraints  and leave this cell, with the door open.
The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
Laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:
TROOPER GUARD #2
I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum!
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY
LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And tries again.
REY
You will remove these restraints and leave this cell, with the door open.
TROOPER GUARD #2
I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:
REY
And you will drop your weapon!
TROOPER GUARD #2
And I'll drop my weapon.
The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN!REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY
Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in
The empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
KYLO REN
NO!
Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and --
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY
WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast;
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside.  Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY --
GENERAL HUX
Begin charging the weapon!
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Yes, sir. Weapon charging
EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY
A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN to the Starkiller Base planet.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO, Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,  and others. An urgent, messy strategy session --
POE
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.
SNAP
They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
BRANCE
A laser cannon?
SNAP
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
MAJOR EMATT
(HORRIBLE MEMORIES)
It's another Death Star
POE
I wish that were the case, Major.
Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.
POE (CONT'D)
This was the Death Star
Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER.
BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in comparison.
POE (CONT'D)
This is Starkiller Base.
This is news to many here, and they're stunned.
HAN
So, it's big.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
How is it possible to power a weapon of this size?
FINN
It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears.
An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.
LEIA
(eyes on datacard)
The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now.
(then, heart sinking)
Our system is the next target.
C-3PO
Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.
They all react to this horrible news.
HAN
Okay, how do we blow it up?
(all eyes on him)
There's always a way to do that.
But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence. Frustrated. Finally, rallying them:
LEIA
Han's right.
Han is surprised.
ADMIRAL STATURA
(at first hesitant)
In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator...
FINN
There is one.
All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE
FINN (CONT'D)
Precinct 47. Here.
ADMIRAL STATURA
(HYPOTHESIZING)
If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.
MAJOR EMATT
... Maybe the planet.
Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.
POE
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
HAN
We disable the shields.
(TO FINN)
Kid, you worked there, what do you got?
FINN
(beat, then:)
I can do it.
HAN
I like this guy
FINN
I can disable the shields. But I  have to be there, on the planet-
HAN
We'll get you there.
LEIA
Han, how?
HAN
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
POE
So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go!
And everyone splits.
EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS
MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make adjustments as crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships,Including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing. Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket. Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this:
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon  for one more daring run, maybe its last:
HAN
Chewie, check that donal capitator Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be Careful with those - they're explosives.
FINN
Now you tell me?
LEIA
No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave.
Han looks over, there's Leia
HAN
That's what I did it. So you'd miss me.
She laughs, moves up close to him.
LEIA
I did miss you.
He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:
HAN
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good.
LEIA
... Pretty good.
HAN
Some things never change.
LEIA
(SMILES)
True. You still drive me crazy.
Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty
years ago; They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back. They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. Quietly, LONGINGLY:
LEIA (CONT'D)
If you see our son again, bring him  home.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
STORMTROOPER
Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.

Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie.
FINN
How are we getting in?
HAN
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything
traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.
Finn is suddenly filled with dread.
FINN
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?!
Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!
HAN
Alright, Chewie, get ready.
Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.
HAN (CONT'D)
And Now!
Chewie and Han hit switches --

And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY
A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the
MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW! It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow!

OFFICER
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert.

MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES.
FINN
The flooding tunnels are over that  ridge. We'll get in that way.
HAN
What was your job when you were based here?
FINN
Sanitation.
HAN
Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
FINN
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY
TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the whitepill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-  and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.  WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which she opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY
A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base
Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS.

WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
Into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED
SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY
CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION -- Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly works controls on the workstation.
FINN
You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
CAPTAIN PHASMA
You're making a big mistake.
FINN
Do it.
Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the
controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on THE WORKSTATION:

Solo,if this works,we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.
HAN
Don't worry kid, we won't leave here  without her.
The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".
CAPTAIN PHASMA
(to Finn, cruel)
You can't be so stupid as to think  will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.

Yeah, there is...

Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey --

Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan.
Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE

Are you all right?
REY
Yeah.
HAN
Good.
FINN
What happened -- did he hurt you?
REY
Finn. What are you doing here?!
FINN
We came back for you.
She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.
FINN (CONT'D)
What'd he say?
REY
(shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears)
... That it was your idea.
Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.
REY (CONT'D)
Thank you.
FINN
How did you get away?
REY
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
HAN
Escape now. Hug later.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close-Passing TIE Fighter!
SNAP
I got one behind me. See it?
JESS
Yeah, I'm on it!
A heavy cannon emplacement launches a missile that shreds an X-wing fighter.
JESS
Furillo's been hit!
SNAP
Watch out for ground fire!
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY
The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the TIE Fighters and missiles PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the lop-sided battle.
THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES A long moment of communication.
HAN
They're in trouble. We can't leave.
(to Finn, re: Chewie)
My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:
KAYDEL KO CONNIX
General, are you seeing this?
VOBER DAND
Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
C-3PO
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS
Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch.Instantly Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.
ALARMS START BLARING!
INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS
Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of Rey and she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NEAR DARKNESS
The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout. Step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.
HAN
That girl knows her stuff.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NEAR DARKNESS
Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones
HAN
We'll set the charges at every other column.
He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.
HAN (CONT'D)
You're right. That's a better idea.
(checks his detonator)
You take the top.
(CHEWIE DOES)
I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here.
They head off in opposite directions.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS
Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear, and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS
A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches. CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation, Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS
A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure
SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.
KYLO REN
Find them!
They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NEAR DARKNESS
The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking carefully where blind corners intersect from the peri-meter. They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the shadows of the grillwork.
Once they're gone, he plants another charge.
EXT.STARKILLER BASE-OSCILLATOR-NEAR DARKNESS
The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY GONE.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide
Vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
Demeanor changes --
HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN from his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space, unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo rhrough his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:
HAN
Ben!
The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns.
KYLO REN
Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
That allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing  and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.
HAN
Take off that mask. You don't need it.
KYLO REN
What do you think you'll see if I do?
Han moves toward Kylo Ren.
HAN
The face of my son.
Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man.
KYLO REN
Your son is gone. He was weak and  foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.
HAN
That's what Snoke wants you to believe. But it's not true. My son is alive.
SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE-LOWER LEVEL-NEAR DARKNESS
Kylo flares.
KYLO REN
No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:
HAN
Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true.
Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.
KYLO REN
It's too late.
HAN
No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes...
KYLO REN
I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS
Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.
KYLO REN
I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.
HAN
Yes. Anything...
Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
It. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch
VANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- But with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!
REY
Nooooooooo!
KYLO REN
Thank you.
ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --
FINN
(PANTING)
Solo.
REY
(ALSO PANTING)
No.
Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE STRUCTURE!
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, DEVASTATED.
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT
Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.
Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT!
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
ADMIRAL ACKBAR
The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional.
COMMODORE META reacts.
OFFICER TABALA ZO
Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.
FINN
The Falcon's this way.
Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
they can't run.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT
Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
out the saber, ignites it. A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.
STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY. Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.
KYLO REN
We're not done yet.
REY
You're a monster!
KYLO REN
It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.
After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --  she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.
FINN
Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no...
Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.
KYLO REN
TRAITOR!
In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.
KYLO REN (CONT'D)
That lightsaber. It belongs to me!
FINN
Come get it.
Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more!
Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
men fighting, through the trees.
Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK - wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance.
That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --  LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!  Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN--AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!
KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER. It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked by her raw,innate skill.
INT. X-WING - NIGHT
NIV LEK
We just lost R-1!
JESS
We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working!
Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:
YOLO ZIFF
Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in!
POE
Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!
LT. BASTIAN
I'm on it!
ELLO ASTY
Roger!
POE
Everybody else, hit the target hard!Give it everything you got!
And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT
Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
trench leading to the oscillator structure!
POE
I need some help here! I need some help!
LT. BASTIAN
I'm coming in!
JESS
Watch out!
ELLO ASTY
I'm hit!
The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.
POE
All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me!
NIV LEK
Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe!
The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
into the fiery breach.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS
Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH
THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Weapon at full capacity in thirty  seconds.
GENERAL HUX
Prepare to fire.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT
Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
volley of torpedoes.
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT
The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --           and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground
EXPLOSIONS!
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK -- MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!
KYLO REN
You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!
REY
The Force.
Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS  BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
watches this out the control room window in horror. He
hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:
COLONEL DATOO
Lieutenant, get back to your station!
YOUNG TECHNICIAN
(stops, fleetingly)
Just look. We won't survive – even Hux has gone!
As he hurries off, WE HEAR:
GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
Supreme Leader.
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together but is horrified, heartsick:
GENERAL HUX
The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun.
Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.
SNOKE
Leave the base at once and come to with Kylo Ren.
(GRIM)
It is time to complete his training.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.
REY
Finn! Finn...
Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:
LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE! CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!
EXT. FALCON - NIGHT
Chewie exits the ship.
MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries with them back into the ship --
INT. FALCON - NIGHT
Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.
INT. X-WING - NIGHT
POE
All teams! I got eyes on them!
SNAP
Yes!
The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home.
POE
Our job's done here. Let's go home!
EXT. D'QAR - DAY
ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,  meet them, usher them inside.
MEDIC
Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat.
Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands.Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning their losses. As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. The droids beep at each other.
C-3PO
R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that!
(he swats R2-D2, who  CONTINUES BEEPING)
Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We  must go tell the others at once!
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.
C-3PO (O.S.)
General? Excuse me, General?
Leia turns to see droids.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news.
LEIA
Tell me.
Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK! BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --
POE
Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY -- TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
Everyone REACTS -- amazed --
C-3PO
Oh! The map! It is complete!
LEIA
(hand on her heart)
-- Luke --
Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:
C-3PO
(to R2-D2)
Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY
A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
despite her fear:
REY
We'll see each other again. I believe that.Thank you, my friend.
EXT. D'QAR - DAY
Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:
LEIA

Rey turns around.
LEIA (CONT'D)
May the Force be with you.
This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully.Rey crosses to the Falcon

EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted  with countless GREEN TREES.The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS.
EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
Rey,her staff strapped to her back,begins her hike up the con- siderable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,who watch her from the bottom of the ramp.A deep breath and Rey continues her journey.
EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.
EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees\senses no one.
And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.Standing 40 ft away from her,his back to us,is a MAN In a CLOAK AND ROBE
Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY to her. Pulls back his hood.
IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER. Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His look says it all.
In response, Rey pulls something from the pack:LUKE'S LIGHTSABER. And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope.
HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning...
THE 
1 ContributorThe Ghost Of Fadon LyricsON Gask's deserted ancient hall
Was twilight closing fast,
And, in its dismal shadows, all
Seem'd lofty, void, and vast.
All sounds of life, now reft and bare,
From its walls had pass'd away,
But the stir of small birds shelter'd there,
Dull owl, or clatt'ring jay.
Loop-hole and window, dimly seen,
With faint light passing through,
Grew dimmer still, and the dreary scene
Was fading from the view:
When the trampling sound of banded men
Came from the court without;
Words of debate and call, and then
A loud and angry shout.
But mingled echoes from within
A mimick mock'ry made,
And the bursting door, with furious din,
On jarring hinges bray'd
An eager band, press'd rear on van,
Rush'd in with clam'rous sound,
And their chief, the goodliest, bravest man,
That e'er trode Scottish ground.
Then spoke forthwith that leader bold,
'We war with wayward fate:
'These walls are bare, the hearth is cold,
'And all is desolate.
'With fast unbroke and thirst unslaked,
'Must we on the hard ground sleep?
'Or, like ghosts from vaulted charnel waked
'Our cheerless vigil keep?'
'Hard hap this day in bloody field,
'Ye bravely have sustain'd,
'And for your pains this dismal bield,
'And empty board have gain'd.
'Hie, Malcom, to that varlet's steed,
'And search if yet remain
'Some homely store, but good at need,
'Spent nature to sustain.
'Cheer up, my friends! still, heart in hand,
'Tho' few and spent we be,
'We are the pith of our native land,
'And she shall still be free.
'Cheer up! tho' scant and coarse our meal,
'In this our sad retreat,
'We'll fill our horn to Scotland's weal,
'And that will make it sweet.'
Then all, full cheerly, as they could,
Their willing service lent,
Some broke the boughs, some heap'd the wood,
Some struck the sparkling flint.
And a fire they kindled speedily,
Where the hall's last fire had been,
And pavement, walls, and rafters high,
In the rising blaze were seen.
Red gleam on each tall buttress pour'd,
The lengthen'd hall along,
And tall and black behind them lower'd
Their shadows deep and strong.
The ceiling, ribb'd with massy oak,
From bick'ring flames below,
As light and shadow o'er it broke,
Seem'd wav'ring to and fro.
Their scanty meal was on the ground,
Spread by the friendly light,
And they made the brown-horn circle round,
As cheerly as they might.
Some talk of horses, weapons, mail,
Some of their late defeat,
By treach'ry caused, and many a tale
Of Southron spy's retreat.
'Aye, well,' says one, 'my sinking heart
'Did some disaster bode,
'When faithless Fadon's wily art
'Beguiled us from the road.'
'But well repaid by Providence
'Are such false deeds we see;
'He's had his rightful recompence,
'And cursed let him be.'
'Oh! curse him not! I needs must rue
'That stroke so rashly given:
'If he to us were false or true,
'Is known to righteous Heaven.'
So spoke their chief, then silent all
Remain'd in sombre mood,
Till they heard a bugle's larum call
Sound distant thro' the wood.
'Rouse ye, my friends!' the chieftain said,
'That blast, from friend or foe,
'Comes from the west; thro' forest shade
'With wary caution go.
'And bring me tidings. Speed ye well!'
Forth three bold warriors past.
Then from the east with fuller swell
Was heard the bugle blast.
Out past three warriors more; then shrill,
The horn blew from the north,
And other eager warriors still,
As banded scouts, went forth.
Till from their chief each war-mate good
Had to the forest gone,
And he, who fear'd not flesh and blood,
Stood by the fire alone.
He stood, wrapp'd in a musing dream,
Nor rais'd his drooping head,
Till a sudden, alter'd, paly gleam
On all around was spread.
Such dull, diminish'd, sombre sheen
From moon eclips'd, by swain
Belated, or lone herd is seen
O'er-mantling hill and plain.
Then to the fitful fire he turn'd,
Which higher and brighter grew,
Till the flame like a baleful meteor burn'd
Of clear sulphureous blue.
Then wist the chief, some soul unblest,
Or spirit of power was near;
And his eyes adown the hall he cast,
Yet naught did there appear.
But he felt a strange unearthly breath
Upon the chill air borne,
And he heard at the gate, like a blast of wrath,
The sound of Fadon's horn.
Owls, bats, and swallows, flutt'ring, out
From hole and crevice flew,
Circling the lofty roof about,
As loud and long it blew.
His noble hound sprang from his lair,
The midnight rouse to greet,
Then, like a timid trembling hare,
Couch'd at his master's feet.
Between his legs his drooping tail,
Like dog of vulgar race,
He hid, and with strange piteous wail,
Look'd in his master's face.
The porch seem'd void, but vapour dim
Soon fill'd the lowering room,
Then was he aware of a figure grim,
Approaching thro' the gloom.
And striding as it onward came,
The vapour wore away;
Till it stood distinctly by the flame,
Like a form in the noon of day.
Well Wallace knew that form, that head,
That throat unbraced and bare,
Mark'd deep with streaming circlet red,
And he utter'd a rapid prayer.
But when the spectre rais'd its arm,
And brandish'd its glitt'ring blade,
That moment broke fear's chilly charm
On noble Wallace laid.
The threaten'd combat was to him
Relief; with weapon bare,
He rush'd upon the warrior grim,
But his sword shore empty air.
Then the spectre smiled with a ghastly grin,
And its warrior-semblance fled,
And its' features grew stony, fix'd, and thin,
Like the face of the stiffen'd dead.
The head a further moment crown'd
The body's stately wreck,
Shook hideously, and to the ground
Dropt from the bolter'd neck.
Back shrunk the noble chief aghast,
And longer tarried not,
But quickly to the portal past,
To shun the horrid spot.
But in the portal, stiff and tall,
The apparition stood,
And Wallace turn'd and cross'd the hall,
Where entrance to the wood.
By other door he hoped to snatch,
Whose pent arch darkly lower'd,
But there, like sentry on his watch,
The dreadful phantom tower'd.
Then up the ruin'd stairs so steep,
He ran with panting breath,
And from a window--desp'rate leap!
Sprang to the court beneath.
O'er wall and ditch he quickly got,
Thro' brake and bushy stream,
When suddenly thro' darkness shot
A red and lurid gleam.
He look'd behind, and that lurid light
Forth from the castle came;
Within its circuit thro' the night
Appear'd an elrich flame.
Red glow'd each window, slit, and door,
Like mouths of furnace hot,
And tint of deepest blackness wore
The walls and steepy moat.
But soon it rose with bright'ning power,
Till bush and ivy green,
And wall-flower, fringing breach and tower,
Distinctly might be seen.
Then a spreading blaze with eddying sweep,
Its spiral surges rear'd,
And then aloft on the stately keep,
Fadon's Ghost appear'd.
A burning rafter, blazing bright,
It wielded in its hand;
And its warrior-form, of human height,
Dilated grew, and grand.
Coped by a curling tawny cloud,
With tints sulphureous blent,
It rose with burst of thunder loud,
And up the welkin went.
High, high it rose with wid'ning glare,
Sent far o'er land and main,
And shot into the lofty air,
And all was dark again.
A spell of horror lapt him round,
Chill'd, motionless, amazed,
His very pulse of life was bound
As on black night he gazed.
Till harness'd warriors' heavy tread,
From echoing dell arose;
'Thank God!' with utter'd voice, he said,
'For here come living foes.'
With kindling soul that brand he drew
Which boldest Southron fears,
But soon the friendly call he knew,
Of his gallant brave compeers.
With haste each wond'rous tale was told,
How still, in vain pursuit,
They follow'd the horn thro' wood and wold,
And Wallace alone was mute.
Day rose; but silent, sad, and pale,
Stood the bravest of Scottish race;
And each warrior's heart began to quail,
When he look'd in his leader's 

Part II:
The Case of Haiti
July-August, 1994
As discussed in Part I, the Reagan-Bush Administrations reluctantly adopted "prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change," and "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" (Thomas Carothers of the Reagan State Department). The leading idea is revealed in the documents of USAID's democracy project, which stress that the U.S. supports "processes of democratic institutional reform that will further economic liberalization objectives" -- that is, entrenchment of the service role.1
The reference to "the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" has to undergo the usual translation. The phrase "United States" refers to the "traditional structures of power" at home. This is among the elementary truths that are to remain unspoken, along with the fact that the policies for the service areas merely adapt a conception of democracy that is to apply to the home societies as well. Here the general public "must be put in its place," as Walter Lippmann explained in his progressive essays on democracy long ago. The "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" are to be only "interested spectators of action," not "participants." Their sole "function" in a democracy is to choose periodically among the leadership class (elections). Also unspoken is the fact that the "responsible men" who manage the democratic society gain that status by virtue of their service to "the traditional structures of power." There is a very broad consensus in the intellectual community, and of course the business world, that the "ignorant and incapable mass of humanity" must not be allowed to disrupt policy formation (Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing), that planners must be "insulated" from politics, in World Bank lingo.
The "prodemocracy policies" in the service areas long antedate the Reaganites, and have little to do with the Cold War, apart from ideological cover. Accordingly, they should be expected to persist, as they do. Among the cases reviewed in Part I, the most striking is Colombia, which has become the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and the recipient of more than half of total U.S. military aid and training, sent on its way with the usual acclaim for Colombia's democratic achievements as state terror mounts -- all rising to new heights under Clinton.
"Human Rights enhancement" marches on in parallel. In Part I, I reviewed Clinton's steps to evade congressional efforts to impose human rights conditions on military aid and trade privileges for Indonesia and China, and the concept of "human rights" itself, crafted to evade atrocities that contribute to profit. In the weeks since, the China story took its predictable course. "President Clinton's decision to renew China's trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between America's global economic interests and its self-image as the world's leading advocate of human rights," Thomas Friedman's lead article opened in the New York Times, reporting the surprising outcome. Clinton did not merely endorse the Bush Administration policies that he had caustically denounced during the presidential campaign, but went well beyond them, deciding "to delink human rights" completely from trade privileges.2
The Indonesia case sheds further light on the "titanic clash." As discussed in Part I, Clinton joined his predecessors and colleagues abroad in ensuring the welfare of the Indonesian tyrants and murderers and the foreign corporations that benefit from their rule, blocking and evading congressional restrictions on military assistance. The issue was quite narrow: whether to refrain from direct participation in Indonesian atrocities at home and abroad. There was no thought of proceeding beyond, to some action to deter some of the worst crimes of the modern era.
The review in Part I was perhaps unfair in not mentioning that world leaders do recognize some limits, and have indeed considered sanctions against Indonesia. In November 1993, on behalf of the nonaligned movement and the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia submitted to the UN a resolution requesting an opinion from the World Court on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. In the face of this atrocity, the guardians of international morality leaped into action. The U.S., U.K., and France threatened Indonesia with trade sanctions and termination of aid unless it withdrew the resolution, as it did. Traditional clients understand very well when a message from the powerful is to be heeded.
Citizens of the free world were again fortunate to have the information readily available to them; in this case, in the Catholic Church press in Canada.3
Freedom of information can go only so far, however. On June 10, the World Court was scheduled to take up the WHO request for an opinion, despite a furious campaign by the U.S., U.K., and their allies to prevent this outrage. The matter is of some importance. Even consideration of the issue by the Court would be a contribution to the cause of nonproliferation; even more so a decision that use of nuclear weapons is a crime under international law -- hence by implication, possession as well. As of mid-June, I have found no word on the matter, though the nonproliferation treaty is a topic of lead headlines, particularly the threat posed to its renewal in 1995 by North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.
I barely mentioned one of the clearest tests of the Clinton vision on "democracy enhancement": Haiti. The case serves well to illustrate the "prodemocracy policies" of the Reagan-Bush years, as Carothers accurately describes them. We may ask, then, how things changed as the New Democrats took command.4
1. The Legacy of History
Even the briefest glimpse of Haiti's torment leaves impressions that do not easily fade, beginning with the scene of desolation on approaching the international airport. It is hard to remember that through the 18th century the island was the richest and most profitable of the Western colonies, and like today's Bangladesh, had struck the European conquerors as a virtual paradise. The Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince, dominating a large square, is flanked by the headquarters of the military command and, at a slight remove, the equally-dreaded police. The symbols of authority and violence stand in impudent mockery of the misery that lies below them -- "confirming the permanence of power, a reminder to the people of their smallness in regard to the state, a reminder to the executioners of the omnipotence of their chief," in the worlds of Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, expressing the logic of the Duvalierists, Papa Doc and Baby Doc, who ruled with brutal violence for 30 years.5
In the markets and slums below, it is barely possible to make one's way down alleys of mud and filth through teeming masses of people clad in rags. Women struggle past with huge burdens on their heads, children try to sell any miserable object, an occasional cart is dragged through mud that is inches deep and puddles left by recent rains. Flies swarm over a handful of vegetables and what might pass for fish. Peasants who have trudged down from the mountains on ancient trails sit by their paltry offerings, sleeping in the relics of shacks that line the alleys. In the depths of Third World poverty, one rarely finds a scene so noxious and depressing.
When I visited briefly a year ago, before the renewed terror, some people in the marketplace were willing to speak in the presence of a translator who was known and trusted, but only in circumlocution. The eyes of the security forces are everywhere, they intimated by their gestures more than their words. These were uniform: hunger, no work, no hope -- unless, somehow, President Aristide returns, though few dare to articulate the phrase beyond hints and nods. Some do, with remarkable courage, even after police torture and the threat of worse. It is not easy to believe that such courage can long survive, even if the people do.
U.S. relations with Haiti are not a thing of yesterday, and show no sign of fundamental change. They go back 200 years, to the days when the Republic that had just won its independence from Britain joined the imperial powers in their campaign to quell Haiti's slave rebellion by violence. When the rebellion nevertheless succeeded, the U.S. exceeded all others in the harshness of its reaction, refusing to recognize Haiti until 1862, in the context of the American civil war. At that moment, Haiti was important for its strategic location and as a possible dumping ground for freed slaves; Liberia was recognized in the same year, for the same reasons. Haiti then became a plaything for U.S.-European power politics, with numerous U.S. interventions culminating in Woodrow Wilson's invasion of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where his warriors -- as viciously racist as the Administration in Washington -- murdered and destroyed, reinstituted virtual slavery, dismantled the constitutional system because the backward Haitians could not see the merits of turning their country into a U.S. plantation, and established the National Guards that held both countries in their grip after the Marines finally left.
Wilson's thuggery has entered history in two different versions: here and there. In the U.S., the events figure in the amusing reconstructions entitled "history" as an illustration of U.S. "humanitarian intervention" and its difficulties (for us). Haitians have somewhat different memories. "Most observers agree that the achievements of the occupation were minor; they disagree only as to the amount of damage it inflicted," Trouillot writes under the heading "unhealed sores." The damage included the acceleration of Haiti's economic, military, and political centralization, its economic dependence and sharp class divisions, the vicious exploitation of the peasantry, the internal racial conflicts much intensified by the extreme racism of the occupying forces, and perhaps worst of all, the establishment of "an army to fight the people." "The 1915-1934 U.S. occupation of Haiti," he writes, "left the country with two poisoned gifts: a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus.6
A year ago, after enduring almost two years of renewed state violence, grassroots organizations, priests in hiding, tortured labor leaders, and others suffering bitterly from the violence of the security forces expressed marked opposition to the plan to dispatch 500 UN police to the terrorized country, seeing them as a cover for a U.S. intervention that evokes bitter memories of the Marine occupation. If ever noted, such reactions may be attributed to the fact that "even a benevolent occupation creates resistance...among the beneficiaries" (Harvard historian David Landes, writing about the Marine occupation). Or to the deficiencies of people who need only a new culture and more kind tutelage of the kind he provided as director of the USAID mission in 1977-79, Lawrence Harrison writes in a "think piece" on Haiti's problems in which the U.S. military occupation merits only the words: "And some of the Marines abused their power."7
Poor and suffering people do not have the luxury of indulging in fairy tales. Not uncommonly, their own experience gives them a grasp of realities that are well concealed by the intellectual culture. The usual victims can not so easily dismiss the record of U.S. power, which leaves little doubt that U.S. military intervention in Haiti would be the death knell for any form of democracy that "risks upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied." Haitians who have lost all hope for restoration of democracy might support a military intervention that could, perhaps, reduce terror and torture. But that is the most that can be realistically expected.
The military occupation left the island under U.S. control and largely U.S.-owned. The killer and torturer Trujillo took over the Dominican Republic, remaining a great friend until he began to get out of hand in the 1950s. In Haiti, Washington reacted with some ambivalence to the murderous and brutal dictatorship of "Papa Doc" Francois Duvalier, finding him a bit too independent for its taste. Nevertheless, Kennedy provided him with military assistance, in line with his general program of establishing firm U.S. control over the hemisphere's military and police as they undertook the task of "internal security" that he assigned them in a historic 1962 decision. Kennedy also provided aid for the Francois Duvalier International Airport in exchange for the Haitian vote to expel Cuba from the OAS. When "Baby Doc" Jean-Claude took over in 1971, relations rapidly improved, and Haiti became another "darling" of the business community, along with Brazil under the neo-Nazi generals and other right-thinking folk. USAID undertook to turn Haiti into the "Taiwan of the Caribbean," forecasting "a historic change toward deeper market interdependence with the United States," Trouillot observes. U.S. taxpayers funded projects to establish assembly plants that would exploit such advantages as enormous unemployment (thanks in part to USAID policies emphasizing agroexport) and a workforce -- mainly women, as elsewhere considered more docile -- with wages of 14 cents an hour, no unions, ample terror, and the other usual amenities. The consequences were profits for U.S. corporations and their Haitian associates, and a decline of 56% in wages in the 1980s. In short, if not Taiwan exactly, Haiti was an "economic miracle" of the usual sort.
Haiti offered the Reaganites yet another opportunity to reveal their understanding of democracy enhancement in June 1985, when its legislature unanimously adopted a new law requiring that every political party must recognize President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier as the supreme arbiter of the nation, outlawing the Christian Democrats, and granting the government the right to suspend the rights of any party without reasons. The law was ratified by a majority of 99.98%. Washington was deeply impressed, as much so as it was when Mussolini won 99% of the vote in the March 1934 election, leading Roosevelt's State Department to conclude that the results "demonstrate incontestably the popularity of the Fascist regime" and of "that admirable Italian gentleman" who ran it, as Roosevelt described the dictator. These are among the many interesting facts that might be recalled as neo-Fascists now take their place openly in the political system that was reconstructed with their interests in mind as Italy was liberated by American forces 50 years ago. Curiously, all this escaped attention during the D-Day anniversary extravaganza, along with much else that is too enlightening.
The 1985 steps to enhance democracy in Haiti were "an encouraging step forward," the U.S. Ambassador informed his guests at a July 4 celebration. The Reagan Administration certified to Congress that "democratic development" was progressing, so that military and economic aid could continue to flow -- mainly into the pockets of Baby Doc and his entourage. It also informed Congress that the human rights situation was improving, as it was at the time in El Salvador and Guatemala, and today in Colombia, and quite generally when some client regime requires military aid for "internal security." The House Foreign Affairs Committee, controlled by Democrats, had given its approval in advance, calling on Reagan "to maintain friendly relations with Duvalier's non-Communist government."
To justify their perception of an "encouraging step forward" in "democratic development," the Reaganites could have recalled the vote held under Woodrow Wilson's rule after he had disbanded the Haitian parliament in punishment for its refusal to turn Haiti over to American corporations under a new U.S.-designed Constitution. Wilson's Marines organized a plebiscite in which the Constitution was ratified by a 99.9% vote, with 5% of the population participating, using "rather high handed methods to get the Constitution adopted by the people of Haiti," the State Department conceded a decade later. Baby Doc, in contrast, allowed a much broader franchise, though it is true that he demanded a slightly higher degree of acquiescence than Wilsonian idealists, Mussolini, and New Dealers. A case could be made, then, that the lessons in democracy that Washington had been laboring to impart were finally sinking in.
These gratifying developments were short-lived, however. By December 1985, popular protests were straining the resources of state terror. What happened next was described by the Wall Street Journal with engaging frankness: after "huge demonstrations," the White House concluded "that the regime was unraveling" and that "Haiti's ruling inner circle had lost faith in" its favored democrat, Baby Doc. "As a result, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, began openly calling for a `democratic process' in Haiti." Small wonder that Shultz is so praised for his commitment to democracy and other noble traits.
The meaning of this call for democracy was underscored by the scenario then unfolding in the Philippines, where the army and elite made it clear they would no longer support another gangster for whom Reagan and Bush had expressed their admiration, even "love," not long before, so that the White House "began openly calling for a `democratic process'" there as well. Both events accordingly enter the canon as a demonstration of how we "served as inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" in those wondrous years (New Republic).
Washington lent its support to the post-Duvalier National Council of Government (CNG), providing $2.8 million in military aid in its first year, while the CNG, "generously helped by the U.S. taxpayer's money, had openly gunned down more civilians than Jean-Claude Duvalier's government had done in fifteen years" (Trouillot). After a series of coups and massacres, Reagan's Ambassador explained to Human Rights investigators that "I don't see any evidence of a policy against human rights"; there may be violence, it is true, but it is just "part of the culture." We can only watch in dismay and incomprehension.
Haitian violence thus falls into the same category as the atrocities in El Salvador at the same time, for example, the massacre at El Mozote, one of the many conducted by U.S.-trained elite battalions -- and one of the few to be admitted to History, after exposure by the UN Truth Commission. Given their origins in U.S. planning, these routine atrocities must also be "part of the culture." Or perhaps "There is no one to blame except the gods of war," as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the New York Times observed, reviewing the "fair-minded" account by Mark Danner which "aptly denotes" the "horrifying incident" as "a central parable of the cold war" for which blame is shared equally by Salvadorans on all sides, murderers and victims alike. In contrast, atrocities organized and directed by the Soviet Union always seemed to have more determinable origins, for some reason.8
2. The Democratic Interlude
Haiti's happy ascent towards Taiwan was deflected unexpectedly in December 1990, when a real problem arose, unlike the terror and virtual enslavement of workers that are just "part of the culture." Washington made a serious error, allowing a free election in expectation of an easy victory for its candidate, Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official. To the surprise of outside observers, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected with two-thirds of the vote (Bazin was second with 14%), backed by a popular movement, Lavalas, which had escaped the notice of the rich folk. Outside of properly educated circles, one question came to the fore at once: What would the U.S. and its clients do to remove this cancer?
President Aristide held office from February to September, when his government was overthrown by a military coup, plunging the country into even deeper barbarism than before. There are two versions of what happened in the interim. One is given by various extremists who see Aristide as the representative of a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations (Lavalas) that gave the large majority of the population a "considerable voice in local affairs" and even in national politics (Americas Watch); and who were impressed by Aristide's domestic policies as he "acted quickly to restore order to the government's finances" after taking power when "the economy was in an unprecedented state of disintegration" (Inter-American Development Bank). Other international lending agencies agreed, offering aid and endorsing Aristide's investment program. They were particularly impressed by the steps he took to reduce foreign debt and inflation, to raise foreign exchange reserves from near zero to $12 million, to increase government revenues with successful tax collection measures (reaching into the kleptocracy), to streamline the bloated government bureaucracy and eliminate fictitious positions in an anti-corruption campaign, to cut back contraband trade and improve customs, and to establish a responsible fiscal system.
These actions were "welcomed by the international financial community," the IADB noted, leading to "a substantial increase in assistance." Atrocities and flight of refugees also virtually ended; indeed the refugee flow reversed, as Haitians began to return to their country in its moment of hope. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti secretly acknowledged the facts. In a February 1991 State Department cable, declassified in 1994, the number two person in the Embassy, Vicky Huddleston, reported to Washington on "the surprisingly successful efforts of the Aristide government,...quickly reversed after the coup" (reported by Dennis Bernstein for Pacific News Service).9
Sophisticates in Washington and New York could understand that all of this is illusion. As Secretary of State Lansing had explained: "The experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature. Of course, there are many exceptions to this racial weakness, but it is true of the mass, as we know from experience in this country. It is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable."
A more acceptable version of Aristide's months in offices is offered by New York Times Haiti correspondent Howard French. He reported after the coup that Aristide had governed "with the aid of fear," leaning "heavily on Lavalas, an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and long-exiled leftists" whose model was China's Cultural Revolution. Aristide's power hunger led to "troubles with civil society." Furthermore, "Haitian political leaders and diplomats say, the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by Father Aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged" the coup. "Although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67% of the popular vote in the country's December 1990 elections, Father Aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the Constitution, and growing fears of political and class-based violence, which many believe the President endorsed.10
Relation to fact aside, the analysis provides some lessons in Political Correctness. Two-thirds of the population and their organizations fall outside of "civil society." Those involved in the popular organizations and in local and national politics are not among the "politically active people." It is scandalous to tell the plain truth about the responsibility of the kleptocracy for "the poverty of the masses." "Fears of political and class-based violence" are limited to the months when such violence sharply declined, its traditional perpetrators being unable, temporarily, to pursue their vocation.
These lessons should be remembered as Washington moves to construct a "civil society" and "democratic political order" for this "failed state" with its degenerate culture and people, quite incapable of governing themselves.
In reality, the two versions of what happened during the democratic interlude are closer than it may seem on the surface. The "remarkably advanced" array of popular organizations that brought the large majority of the population into the political arena is precisely what frightened Washington and the mainstream generally. They have a different understanding of "democracy" and "civil society," one that offers no place to popular organizations that allow the overwhelming majority a voice in managing their own affairs. By definition, the "political leaders" of such popular organizations have only "meager" democratic credentials, and can therefore be granted only symbolic participation in the "democratic institutions" that we will construct in accord with our traditional "prodemocracy policies." So the government and media have been instructing us since the coup removed the radical extremist Aristide and his Maoist clique.
These simple truths account for much of what has happened in Haiti since Aristide's election. Trouillot concludes his study by observing that "In Haiti, the peasantry is the nation." But for policymakers, the peasantry are worthless objects except insofar as they can advance corporate profits. They may produce food for export and enrich local affiliates of U.S. agribusiness, or flock to the city to provide super-cheap labor for assembly plants, but they have no further function. It is therefore entirely natural that USAID, while providing $100 million in assistance to the private sector, should never have provided a penny to the leading popular peasant organization, the Peasant Movement of Papaye (MPP); and that former USAID director Harrison should see no special problem when MPP members are massacred by the military forces and should dismiss with contempt its call for moves to reinstitute the popularly elected President who was committed to "bottom-up" rather than "top-down" democracy.
Similarly, it is hardly surprising that USAID should have denounced the labor reforms Aristide sought to institute and opposed his efforts to raise the minimum wage to a princely 37 cents an hour. Nor should we find it odd that USAID invested massively in the low wage assembly sector while wages sharply declined and working conditions fell to abysmal levels, but terminated all efforts to promote investment as the democratically elected government took office. Rather, USAID reacted to this catastrophe by dedicating itself still more firmly to providing the Haitian business community with what it called "technical assistance in labor relations, development of a business oriented public relations campaign, and intensified efforts to attract U.S. products assembly operations to Haiti." Given the unfortunate democratic deviation, USAID's task, in its own words, was to "work to develop sustainable dialogue between the government and the business community"; no comparable efforts for workers and peasants were needed when Haiti was run by U.S.-backed killers and torturers. All of this conforms well to USAID's conception of "processes of democratic institutional reform" as those that "further economic liberalization objectives.11
Similarly, there is no reason to be surprised that U.S. elites suddenly began to show a sensitive concern for human rights and democracy just as human rights violations precipitously declined and democracy (though not in the preferred "top-down" sense) began to flourish. Amy Wilentz observes that during Aristide's brief term, Washington suddenly became concerned with "human rights and the rule of law in Haiti." "During the four regimes that preceded Aristide," she writes, "international human-rights advocates and democratic observers had begged the State Department to consider helping the democratic opposition in Haiti. But no steps were taken by the United States to strengthen anything but the executive and the military until Aristide won the presidency. Then, all of a sudden, the United States began to think about how it could help those Haitians eager to limit the powers of the executive or to replace the government constitutionally." The State Department "Democracy Enhancement" project was "specifically designed to fund those sectors of the Haitian political spectrum where opposition to the Aristide government could be encouraged," precisely as "prodemocracy policies" dictate. The institutions and leaders that merited such support are just the ones that survived the military coup, also no surprise.12
3. After the Coup
Wilentz reports further that immediately after the September 30 coup, the State Department apparently "circulated a thick notebook filled with alleged human rights violations" under Aristide -- "something it had not done under the previous rulers, Duvalierists and military men," who were deemed proper recipients for aid, including military aid, "based on unsubstantiated human-rights improvements." Toronto Star reporter Linda Diebel adds details. A "thick, bound dossier" on Aristide's alleged crimes was presented by the coup leader, General Cedras, to OAS negotiators. On October 3, U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams summoned reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, and other major U.S. journals to private meetings where he briefed them on these alleged crimes, reportedly presenting them with the "dossier" -- which, we may learn some day, was compiled by U.S. intelligence and provided to its favorite generals. The Ambassador and his helpers began leaking the tales that have been used since to demonstrate Aristide's meager democratic credentials and his psychological disorders.13
The approved version is reflected by coverage of human rights abuses after the coup. As shown in a study by Boston Media Action, while the military were rampaging, the press focussed on abuses attributed to Aristide supporters, less than 1% of the total but the topic of 60% of the coverage in major journals during the two weeks following the coup, and over half of coverage in the New York Times through mid-1992. During the two-week period after the coup, Catherine Orenstein reports, the Times "spent over three times as many column inches discussing Aristide's alleged transgressions  it spent reporting on the ongoing military repression. Mass murders, executions, and tortures that were reported in human rights publications earned less than 4% of the space that the Times devoted to Haiti in those weeks." A week after the coup, the Washington Post accused Aristide of having organized his followers into "an instrument of real terror," ignoring the 75% reduction in human rights abuses during his term reported by human rights groups.14
While attention was directed to the really important topic of the "class-based violence" of Aristide and the popular movements, the U.S.-trained military and police were conducting their reign of terror, "ruthlessly suppressing Haiti's once diverse and vibrant civil society," Americas Watch reported. Though "Washington's capacity to curb attacks on civil society was tremendous, this power was largely unexercised by the Bush administration," which "sought to convey an image of normalcy" while forcefully returning refugees. The terror is functional: it ensures that even if Aristide is permitted to return, "he would have difficulty transforming his personal popularity into the organized support needed to exert civilian authority," Americas Watch observed in early 1993, quoting priests and others who feared that the destruction of the popular social organizations that "gave people hope" had already undermined the great promise of Haiti's first democratic experiment.15
The coup and ensuing terror revived the flow of refugees that had lapsed under Aristide. The Bush Administration ordered the Coast Guard and Navy to force them back, or to imprison them in the U.S. military base in Guantanamo until a court order terminated the shocking practices there. During the presidential campaign, Clinton bitterly condemned these cruel policies. On taking over in January 1993, he at once tightened the noose, imposing a still harsher blockade. Forceful return of refugees continued in violation of international law and human rights conventions. Clinton's increased brutality proved to be a grand success. Refugee flow, which had reached over 30,000 in 1992, sharply declined under Clinton's ministrations, to about the level of 1989, before the sharp decline under Aristide.16
The official story is that these are "economic refugees," not victims of political persecution who would be eligible for asylum. The onset of poverty can be quite precisely dated: to the date of the coup. During Aristide's term, refugee flow was slight, skyrocketing after the coup though economic sanctions were minimal. These oddities are noted by the indispensable journal Haiti Info published in Port-au-Prince, in a discussion of a cable circulated to high officials by U.S. Ambassador William Swing. The 11-page cable, full of racist slanders, alleges that "the Haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda tool" and is "wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort" by human rights organizations and the civilian monitors of the UN and OAS missions; all "comsymps" in the terminology of an earlier day. The Embassy dismissed with a sneer the reports of "the sudden epidemic of rapes" on the grounds that "For a range of cultural reasons (not pleasant to contemplate), rape has never been considered or reported as a serious crime here." The testimony of a man that his wife was raped and that he was badly beaten under police custody, corroborated by a foreign nurse, is dismissed because he chose asylum in Canada (granted at once), avoiding the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- a transparent admission of iniquity. Clinton's Embassy attributes problems in Haiti to "a high level of structural, or endemic, violence," which, again, is just "part of the culture." Like the poverty that causes refugee flight, the "structural" factors causing violence had an unexplained 8-month gap: during Aristide's tenure even his most vehement opponents, the USAID-supported "human rights" advocates who moved quickly into power after the coup, could compile only 25 cases of "mob violence" and four crimes that could be considered political, a tiny fraction of the terror before, not to speak of the atrocities that followed the coup.
Kenneth Roth, the director of Human Rights Watch, comments that the cable reveals the "extreme antipathy for Aristide" in the Embassy and its "willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for  return." It "reflects a dislike and distrust of Aristide that has been widely felt in the Administration -- though voiced only privately," Times correspondent Elaine Sciolino adds. In reality, the dislike is quite public and widely reported, along with the fact that it has sent a very clear message to the Haitian rulers, military and civilian.17
As the Embassy cable was released, an experienced INS asylum officer in Haiti went public with his charges that thousands of "egregious cases of persecution" were rejected by the Haitian INS office, where the "entire process" of asylum review "had been politicized" and under 1% of legitimate petitions were accepted by racist and contemptuous officials; similar accounts have been documented by human rights organizations, who have also denounced the very idea that petitioners should have to identify themselves to the murderers by appearing at the INS office. At the same time, a "Top Secret" memo of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba was leaked. Addressed to the Secretary of State, the CIA, and the INS, the document complains about the lack of genuine claims of political persecution in Cuba, contrary to policy needs. The usual silence prevailed.18
Meanwhile refugees from Cuba receive royal treatment while Haitians are returned to terror. That is nothing new. Of the more than 24,000 Haitians intercepted by U.S. forces from 1981 to Aristide's takeover in 1991, 11 were granted asylum as victims of political persecution, in comparison with 75,000 out of 75,000 Cubans. In these years of terror, Washington allowed 28 asylum claims. During Aristide's tenure, with violence and repression radically reduced, 20 were allowed from a refugee pool perhaps 1/50th the scale. Practice returned to normal after the military coup and the renewed terror. As always, human rights are understood in purely instrumental terms: as a weapon to be selectively deployed for power interests, nothing more.
The democratically elected President will be acceptable to Washington and elite opinion generally only if he abandons his popular mandate, ceding effective power to the "moderates" in the business world. The "moderates" are those who do not favor slaughter and mutilation, preferring to see the population driven to agroexport and the low-wage assembly sector. They constitute "civil society," in the technical sense. Since the coup, the U.S. has demanded that Aristide agree to "broaden the government" in such a way as to place the "moderates" in power. Insofar as he refuses to transfer power into these proper hands, he is an "extremist" whom we can hardly support.
While these are the basic terms of respectable discourse, the spectrum is not entirely uniform. It ranges from the far right, which is honest and outspoken in its call for dismantling Haitian democracy, to the more nuanced versions of the liberal Democrats. Taking a stand in the middle, George Bush calls for abandoning Aristide because "he has become unreliable" and even "turned on our president the other day" (May 1994). Aristide should be dumped because his "undemocratic behavior...included fostering violence against his opponents," according to another noted pacifist who has distinguished himself particularly for his dedication to legality and democratic principle (Elliott Abrams).
Moving toward the liberal end, a Clinton official explained in the last days of 1993 that "We're not talking about dumping Aristide or about military power-sharing. But we have two adversaries who don't want to compromise and we have to find enough of a middle to make a functioning democracy," marginalizing the extremists on both sides. The elected President should be "restored to power, at least nominally," World Peace Foundation president and historian Robert Rotberg added; but also at most nominally, as all understand. The Washington director of the Inter-American Dialogue, Peter Hakim, urged in May 1994 that "the US ought to separate out the notion of protecting human rights, and reestablishing some semblance of society in Haiti, from restoring Aristide to power." "So it is only honest for the United States to tell Father Aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises," as the Times editors phrased the common understanding a few weeks later. In short, the traditional "prodemocracy policies."19 The basic idea was outlined by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his confirmation hearings. Christopher "expressed support for Father Aristide," Elaine Sciolino reported, "but stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as President. `There is no question in my mind that because of the election, he has to be part of the solution to this,' Mr. Christopher said. `I don't have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution, but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter'.20 With this ringing endorsement of democracy, the Clinton Administration took charge.
Across the spectrum, it is taken for granted that we have both the right and the competence to "establish some semblance of society" in Haiti, whose people are so retrograde as to have developed a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations that gave the majority of the population a place in the public arena. Plainly, they desperately need our tutelage.
4. The Clinton Compromise
To much acclaim, Washington finally succeeded in compelling Aristide to transfer authority to the "moderates." Under severe pressure, in July 1993 the Haitian President accepted the U.S.-UN terms for settlement, which were to allow him to return four months later in a "compromise" with the gangsters and killers. He agreed to appoint as Prime Minister a businessman from the traditional mulatto elite, Robert Malval, who is "known to be opposed to the populist policies during Aristide's seven months in power," the press announced with relief, noting that he is "generally well regarded by the business community," "respected by many businessmen who supported the coup that ousted the President," and seen as "a reassuring choice" by coup-supporters.
Shortly after these happy developments took place, UN/OAS observers reported, with little notice, that they were "very concerned that there is no perceptible lessening of human rights violations," and a few weeks later, reported an increase in "arbitrary executions and suspicious deaths" in the weeks following the UN-brokered accord, over one a day in the Port-au-Prince area alone; "the mission said that many of the victims were members of popular organizations and neighborhood associations and that some of the killers were police," wire services reported.21
Expected to be a transitional figure, Malval resigned at the year's end. His presence did, however, serve a useful role for Washington and its media, diverting attention to a "political settlement" while attacks on the popular organizations and general terror mounted, Aristide's promised return was blocked, and new initiatives were put forth to transfer power to traditional power centers ("broadening the government"). Malval's presence also offered the press a great method to bring out Aristide's unreasonable intransigence. He couldn't even come to terms with "his handpicked Prime Minister," a phrase that ritually accompanied the name "Robert Malval." In a typical exercise, Howard French opened a report of Malval's resignation by writing: "Three days after formally resigning, the handpicked Prime Minister of Haiti's exiled President lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him" -- hammering home the message in the fashion that became so routine as to be comical. Malval described Aristide as an "erratic figure" with a "serious ego problem," French continued, referring to his commitment to restore the democratically-elected government.22
As the date for Aristide's scheduled October 30 return approached, atrocities mounted high enough to gain some attention, though no action. Amidst reports of "terrifying stories" of terror, murder, and threats to exterminate all members of the popular organizations, the Clinton Administration announced that the UN Mission "will rely on the Haitian military and police to maintain order" -- that is, on the killers. "It is not a peacekeeping role," Secretary of Defense Aspin explained: "We are doing something other than peacekeeping here." Meanwhile, the press emphasized the concerns of U.S. officials that Aristide "isn't moving strongly to restore democratic rights," from his exile in Washington. "Even as the situation has grown worse, foreign diplomats have increasingly blamed Father Aristide for what they say is his failure to take constructive initiatives," Howard French wrote, using the standard device to disguise propaganda as reporting.23
The stage was set for ignoring the October deadline, as the U.S. stood helplessly by, unable to bring the uncompromising and violent extremists on both sides to accept "democracy."
Reviewing these mid-1993 developments, Ian Martin, who directed the OAS/UN mission from April through December 1993, writes that one basic problem was U.S. insistence on adding "a mostly American military component to the negotiators' proposals." Aristide's call for reducing the Haitian army to 1000 men was rejected. "The Haitian high command, for its part, sought U.S. assistance to ensure the army's future." The generals trusted the U.S. and "mistrusted the U.N. and the proposal for the Canadians and French, both more committed supporters of Aristide than the United States, to take the lead in the police contingent. The U.S. hoped to preserve the military -- an institution it had often assisted and in fact had created for purposes of internal control during the American occupation of 1915-34." Haitian army "resistance was encouraged whenever they perceived that the United States, despite its rhetoric of democracy, was ambivalent about that power shift" to the popular elements represented by Aristide. There was no shortage of such occasions.
The crucial signal, Martin and others agree, came on October 11, when the USS Harlan County was scheduled to disembark U.S. and Canadian troops at Port-au-Prince. The military organized "a hostile demonstration of armed thugs," Martin observes, and "instead of waiting in the harbor while the Haitian military was pressured to ensure a safe landing, the Harlan County turned tail for Guantanamo Bay," leaving officials of the UN/OAS mission "aghast"; they "had been neither consulted nor informed of the decision by President Bill Clinton's National Security Council to retreat." "The organizers of the Haitian protest could hardly believe their success," Martin continues. The leader of the paramilitary organization FRAPH, responsible for much of the terror, said that "My people kept wanting to run away, but I took the gamble and urged them to stay. Then the Americans pulled out! We were astonished. That was the day FRAPH was actually born. Before, everyone said we were crazy, suicidal, that we would all be burned if Aristide returned. But now we know he is never going to return." The military got the message too, loud and clear.
Perhaps they were even notified in advance. New York Daily News correspondent Juan Gonzalez learned of the October 11 port demonstration the day before at a Duvalierist meeting attended by U.S. Embassy personnel. The following day, he asked in print: "How can two Daily News reporters who have only visited Haiti on a few occasions learn beforehand of secret plans to sabotage the landing of our troops, while our vaunted officialdom claims it was caught flat-footed?" How indeed.
Another possible line of communication is suggested in a report by Father Antoine Adrien, former head of Aristide's religious order in Haiti and a close associate. Just before the ship "turned tail," he informed the Catholic Church press that Haitian military officers had not only attended training school in Fort Benning, Ga., in 1992, but that "some were there as recently as the previous week" -- October 1993. "How are you going to tell those people they have no backing in the United States?," Father Adrien asked. That Haitian army officers received training in the U.S. after the coup was confirmed in an internal Pentagon document, including eight officers who started courses in early 1992. The program they joined is designed to expose "future leaders of foreign defense establishments" to "American values, regard for human rights and democratic institutions," according to the Defense Secretary's report to the President for 1993. Earlier graduates include the leading killers in Haiti, Central America, and elsewhere.
What lay behind the decision to turn tail was explained by Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe, who "boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the U.S.S. Harlan County, he had helped save the United States from a `small war'," the Times reported six months later: "He vowed that the Pentagon would not risk American soldiers' lives to put `that psychopath' back in power."24
While messages were coming through to the military, the Haitian people were deprived of the one voice they longed to hear. "Senior Clinton administration officials are embroiled in a fight over whether to allow...Aristide to broadcast into the junta-ruled country using airborne U.S. military transmitters," Paul Quinn-Judge reported in May 1994. The USIA is opposed, fearing that "the plan may violate international law," always a prime concern in Washington. USIA was also concerned that such broadcasts "would provide Aristide with an uncomfortably direct means to communicate with Haitians, who elected him by an overwhelming margin in 1990." His oratory has been known to "create problems," a classifed USIA memorandum of May 23 noted, asking whether "we wish to have the responsibility for having given him the means to broadcast whatever he chooses to Haiti." He might even challenge the U.S. publicly "the first time we refuse to air something." It wouldn't even suffice to have him submit his scripts in advance, because of the "highly nuanced language and context" of a radio broadcast; who knows what thoughts this devious creature might convey by his tone of voice? "Debate over the idea...underscores the continuing ambivalence and nervousness with which some senior officials view Aristide," Quinn-Judge observed.25
After the military coup, the OAS instituted a toothless embargo, which the Bush Administration reluctantly joined, while making clear that it was not to be taken seriously. The reasons were explained a year later by Howard French: "Washington's deep-seated ambivalence about a leftward-tilting nationalist whose style diplomats say has sometimes been disquietingly erratic" precludes any meaningful support for sanctions against the military rulers. "Despite much blood on the army's hands, United States diplomats consider it a vital counterweight to Father Aristide, whose class-struggle rhetoric...threatened or antagonized traditional power centers at home and abroad." Aristide's "call for punishment of the military leadership" that had slaughtered and tortured thousands of people "reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader," and heightened Washington's "antipathy" towards the "clumsy" and "erratic" extremist who has aroused great "anger" because of "his tendency toward ingratitude."26
The "vital counterweight" is therefore to hold total power while the "leftward tilting nationalist" remains in exile, awaiting the "eventual return" that Bill Clinton promised on the eve of his inauguration. Meanwhile, the "traditional power centers" in Haiti and the U.S. will carry on with class struggle as usual, employing such terror as may be needed in order for plunder to proceed unhampered. And as the London Financial Times added at the same time, Washington was proving oddly ineffective in detecting the "lucrative use of the country in the transhipment of narcotics" by which "the military is funding its oil and other necessary imports," financing the necessary terror and rapacity -- though U.S. forces seem able to find every fishing boat carrying miserable refugees. Nor had Washington figured out a way to freeze the assets of "civil society" or to hinder their shopping trips to Miami and New York, or to induce its Dominican clients to monitor the border to impede the flow of goods that takes care of the wants of "civil society" while the embargo remains "at best, sieve-like."27
Meanwhile Washington continued to provide Haitian military leaders with intelligence on narcotics trafficking -- which they naturally used to expedite their activities and tighten their grip on power. It is not easy to intercept narcotraffickers, the press explained, because "Haiti has no radar," and evidently the U.S. Navy and Air Force lack the means to remedy this deficiency.28
Under Clinton, matters only got worse. An April 1994 report of Human Rights Watch/Americas documents the increasing terror and State Department apologetics and evasions, condemning the Administration for having "embraced a murderous armed force as a counterweight to a populist president it distrusts."
On February 4, 1992, the Bush Administration lifted the embargo for assembly plants, "under heavy pressure from American businesses with interests in Haiti," the Washington Post reported, with its editorial endorsement; the lobbying effort was assisted by Elliott Abrams, Human Rights Watch noted. For January-October 1992, U.S. trade with Haiti came to $265 million, according to the Department of Commerce.29
As Clinton took over, the embargo became still more porous. The Dominican border was left wide open. Meanwhile, U.S. companies continued to be exempted from the embargo -- so as to ease its effects on the population, the Administration announced with a straight face; only exemptions for U.S. firms have this curious feature. There were many heartfelt laments about the suffering of poor Haitians under the embargo, but one had to turn to the underground press in Haiti, the alternative media here, or an occasional letter to learn that the major peasant organization (MPP), church coalitions, labor organizations, and the National Federation of Haitian Students continued to call for a real embargo.30
Curiously, some of those most distressed by the impact of the embargo on the Haitian poor were the most forceful advocates of a still harsher embargo on Cuba, notably liberal Democrat Robert Torricelli, author of the stepped-up embargo that the Bush Administration accepted under pressure from the Clintonites. Evidently, hunger causes no pain to Cuban children, another oddity that passed unnoticed, along with the U.S.-Haiti trade figures.
Clinton's tinkering with the embargo also passed without comment here, though the facts are known, and occasionally even leak through, as in a tiny Feb. 13 Reuters dispatch in the New York Times reporting efforts of human rights advocates to convince the President to observe the embargo. "US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year ," the Financial Times reported in London, "thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of goods assembled in Haiti from US parts." U.S. exports to Haiti also rose in 1993. Exports from Haiti to the United States included food (fruits and nuts, citrus fruit or melons) from the starving country, which increased by a factor of 35 from January-July 1992 to January-July 1993. The federal government was among the purchasers of the baseballs imported from Haiti (duty free), stitched by women who work 11 hour days with a half-hour break in unbearable heat without running water or a working toilet, for 10 cents an hour if they can meet the quota (few can), using toxic materials without protection so that the U.S. importer can advertise proudly that their softballs are "hand-dipped for maximum bonding." The manufacturers are the wealthy Haitian families who supported the coup and have gained new riches during the embargo, along with others profiting handsomely from the black market, such as the fuel supplier for the U.S. embassy. The "assembly zone" loophole, criticized by U.S. labor unions and at the UN Security Council by France and Canada in January, was extended by the Clinton Administration on April 25, 1994, four days after announcing that it would seek to tighten UN sanctions; the latter announcement was reported. On the same day, the U.S. Coast Guard returned 98 refugees to military authorities, 18 of them at once arrested.
"The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military," the Financial Times reported, while "European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti."31
In his January 1994 testimony to Congress on "Threats to the U.S. and Its Interests Abroad," the Director of the CIA predicted that Haiti "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly." "Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact," and "any indication of an imminent exodus." The "Threats to the U.S." were contained with the usual selectivity and skill. "Exodus" from the charnel house was effectively blocked, while the press reported an "oil boom" as "diplomats expressed amazement at the extent of the trafficking" organized by the Haitian and Dominican armies, and the former assured reporters that "The military is not concerned about fuel shortages; it has plenty.32
The Clinton Administration has scarcely departed from the prescriptions outlined by the Washington Post and New York Times as it came into office.33 The preferred solution, John Goshko explained in the Post, would "delay indefinitely" the return to Haiti of the "radical priest with anti-American leanings" whose "strident populism led the Haitian armed forces to seize power," and would "allow Bazin or some other prime minister to govern in his place." Bazin was then prime minister under army rule, but was having problems, because although "well-known and well-regarded in the United States," unfortunately "the masses in Haiti consider him a front man for military and business interests." A replacement would therefore be needed to represent the interests of the moderates. In the Times, Howard French indicated the scale of the required delay: "In the past, diplomats have said the Haitian President could return only after a substantial interim period during which the country's economy was revived and all its institutions, from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education, were stabilized." That should overcome the danger of Aristide's "personalist and electoralist politics." But unfortunately, the troublesome priest has been recalcitrant: "Father Aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return," undermining the moderate course.
As understood on all sides, the "delay" need not be too long. Aristide's term ends in 1996, and he is barred from running again. By then military terror should have sufficiently intimidated the population and demolished popular organizations so that "free elections" can be tolerated, as in the Central American terror states, without too much fear of any threat to "civil society" from the rabble.
5. The May 1994 Reversal
Plans proceeded on course into early 1994. By then, the cynicism and brutality of U.S. policy had become too blatant for the usual cover-up, particularly after Clinton's point man Lawrence Pezzullo revealed in congressional testimony that the plan that the Administration had touted as the product of negotiations among Haitian democrats, denouncing Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting it (it made no provision for his return), had in fact been produced by the State Department, which brought to Washington selected Haitians to ratify it, among them Duvalierist collaborators of the murderous police chief Col. Francois. Something new was needed.
Pezzullo was replaced by William Gray, a more credible voice. In May Clinton instituted a new and more humane refugee policy, which "will mean the forcible return of 95 percent of boat people instead of 100 percent," a Human Rights Watch Haiti analyst observed, pointing out that "The US policy excludes people who are not high profile but are persecuted nonetheless." The new policy is just "window dressing," the national refugee coordinator of Amnesty International added.
But 5% of the boat people fleeing persecution is beyond what the United States can be expected to handle. It will "devastate Florida," a Republican congressional staff member complained. Explaining a few days later why the U.S. might have to invade, "Mr. Clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as `the continuous possibility' that Haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a `massive outflow' and seek refuge in the United States," the Times reported; the terms "poor and desperate" convey the doctrine that these are economic refugees. Overcrowded and destitute, the United States plainly cannot bear the burden of accepting refugees or even housing them until their claims of persecution are rejected; and surely it has no historical responsibilities in the matter. The President piteously pleaded with other countries to help us in our plight.34
Curiously, the anguished debate over this issue missed the obvious candidate: Tanzania, which had just then accommodated hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, and could surely come to the rescue of the beleaguered United States by accepting a few thousand more black faces.
On May 21, an embargo was announced which, for the first time, may have some serious intent. The "assembly plant" exemption was quietly removed, and the Dominican border was (at least briefly) closed. The long-known involvement of the Haitian military in narcotrafficking was also officially reported. "We're not going to say, `Let the masses and the middle class suffer, but the very wealthy don't have to pay a price," a senior Administration official stated. "Even Wealthy Haitians Starting to Feel Pinched," a Times headline read, again letting out the real story of the efforts to "restore democracy" during the 2 1/2 years since the coup. Government statements and press reports tacitly conceded what had always been clear: that the U.S. has the means, far short of military intervention, to restore democracy in Haiti, but had no intention of doing so, and still does not. What has always been required is a clear declaration of intent to restore democracy, but that cannot be given, because there is no such intent. The military and their civilian allies understand that perfectly well.
In the following weeks, the U.S. banned commercial air flights and financial transactions, while leaving crucial loopholes open. Personal assets of the coup supporters were not frozen, so they can withdraw funds from U.S. bank accounts at will and transfer money to banks abroad, Administration officials acknowledged -- a matter that may be academic, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Kweisi Mfume, observed, since "the dictators of Haiti have long ago moved their assets in anticipation of this." The sanctions also permit the families that have long dominated the economy to hold on to the monopoly of the food trade that is a major source of their wealth, including the Mevs family, which is building "a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo," French reported, adding that "Washington's hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests," if not fear of "a spate of embarrassing revelations made by Haitians in reprisal for a crackdown."
After sanctions were finally imposed in May 1994, a U.S. diplomat conceded that the continuing failure to move against the richest families has left "a perception out there of sending mixed messages and having double agendas." Other diplomats and Haitian experts agree that the decision not to target key civilian supporters of the coup is yet another mixed signal, noting particularly the relief granted the Mev, Brandt, Acra and Madsen families, who "still have a role to play," a U.S. Embassy source informed the press, though they have made no effort to disguise their support for the coup. Washington is "imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring Aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and are in business with the military in keeping Aristide out that they are free to lead their privileged lives," another diplomat said. Haitian Senators who lead the anti-Aristide movement were not denied their permanent U.S. resident status, including Bernard Sansaricq, who played a leading role in installing the puppet civilian government with its new "president" Emile Jonassaint, appointed to replace Aristide.35
Meanwhile, the serious work of undermining the basis for democracy continues unhampered. By the time Clinton took office, as Americas Watch reported, the terror had already decimated the popular organizations that would allow Aristide "to exert civilian authority," even if he were eventually permitted to return. As Clinton finally agreed to sanctions 16 months later, Douglas Farah reported in the Washington Post that "the army and its allies have damaged democratic institutions and grass-roots organizations that had begun to grow in Haiti to such an extent that they would take years to rebuild even if Haiti's military leaders surrendered power, according to diplomats and human rights monitors." "The Duvalierist system will continue, with or without the return of Aristide," the leader of a now-clandestine pro-Aristide group said, a judgment endorsed by "a veteran human rights worker" who prefers anonymity "because of numerous threats against his life." "The Duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country," he said: "People are losing their ability to make things happen here, and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances." Even nonpolitical community organizations have been repressed, thousands of community leaders have been driven into hiding along with hundreds of thousands of others, while over 4000 have been murdered outright. The "massive terrorism," Farah reports, is "aimed at dismantling the last vestiges of organized support" for Aristide, while the civilian allies of the army and police in FRAPH have "become a very efficient machine of repression," which will remain the only authority even if Aristide were to return, the same human rights worker comments. Members of the popular organizations interviewed in hiding have "applied for political asylum at the U.S. Embassy and been denied.36
To ensure a smooth transition to the intended post-coup system, with the "moderates" in charge and the Duvalierists preserving order, FRAPH and USAID-funded groups linked to it are establishing a monopoly of social services, so that "the poor who are compliant and docile get health services," a Haitian doctor explains. This is the "soft side" of counterinsurgency, on the model of Guatemala and other terror states. Meanwhile we are to ponder the question of whether Haitians "can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy" (Howard French), or whether we must labor for decades in a (perhaps vain) effort to overcome the defects -- cultural, if not genetic -- that had been discerned by Wilson's Secretary of State and Carter's USAID director in Haiti.37
As the Bush Administration prepared to hand over the reins, a senior UN official observed that its dislike of Aristide was an open secret: "Two lines about Haiti co-existed at the time. There was the line about `return to democracy,' which was for public consumption. And then there was a second line, spoken privately within the administration. And the Haitian military knew it perfectly well." A year later, after the Harlan County affair gave birth to FRAPH, a French military adviser updated the picture: "Do you know what the real problem is? The Americans don't want Aristide back, and they want the rest of us out" -- "the rest of us" being Canada, France and Venezuela, the other three of "Aristide's so-called Four Friends."38
That this judgment is exactly right has been apparent throughout. It should be clear, however, that the issue is not Aristide personally. The problem is the forces he represents: the lively and vibrant popular movements that swept him into office, greatly alarming the rich and powerful in Haiti and their American counterparts, and teaching lessons in democracy that have to be silenced, for who can tell what minds they might reach?

Shatter y’all, hurricanes on wood frame houses
The name’s Renée, you’ll never be the same
BLAOW! Game, blouses

Hittin' the block like a hammer hittin' the nail on the head
And come from a city where Hammer made hits and get people fed
And fightin' so steady, we hittin' the block with hammers
And headed into the gritty and ready, crrrack-ack-ack 'till they dead
Left the city asleep on syrupy medicine
And my pockets start to swell, I should seek some acetaminophen, huh?
Three ounces in two styrofoam cups
Take twice daily, duck twelve, it’s never enough
Incredible press, to get 'em to lessen
The pressure on triggers, for niggas is bound to erupt
Call me Vesuvius, what you all foolin' with
Quick and unruly and blow the fuck up
I’m a cut above, a uppercut away, they screamin’ “Finish him” Mortal Kombat, immortal on raps
Diminishing returns make the burners come out, start to wave
Question me if you wanna, y’all, I was up on the stage
Playing a polyglot, glutton, suckin’ a molly popsicle
So sick of the club, I just turn up at the hospital
Ordering orderlies to turn the heat up four degrees
So I can take my shirt off and live out my California dreams
Scribble “Thug Life” in invisible ink
An umbilical minor chord-clipping metaphysical link
To the pastime high, wrecks, last time I checked
There was hella rappers in line for the time to scream, “I’m next”
I just walked right in the door marked “Hamilton Stage,” stayed patient
Playing these dead presidents, I’m getting my reparations
Digg
Here come the one in charge
A hundred bars to get everybody up in arms
When other artists all froze like a gun was drawn
I turn to a new black like the color orange, huh
When I was born, everyone was warned
That this prolific shit I mourn might become the norm
I come through Sun Tzu when it come to war
For one of mine, I’ll be takin’ every one of yours
‘Cause I ain’t even tryna bicker and blame
I feel like the bigger the name, the bigger the game
I spent long nights hunched over a flickering flame
Perfecting this particular slang, I’m sick in the brain
I’m on it, I seen it comin’ like a clairvoyant
So I just left the meter runnin’ and prepared for ya
I call it premonition, intuition, paranoia
But a lot of people are scared, shit, I’m scared for ya
I see the flag’s still getting swung hard
But we done turned the Motor City into a junkyard
We keep playin’ ourselves, and playin’ the trump card
The neverending search for something that’s for a fuck, hard
To keep up with the Joneses or them Kardashians
Only to be exposed like Ashley Madison
I’m like, is this a rerun? Oh, that’s what’s happenin’
Somebody probably goin’ be coming at this African
Look at me, I’m a Six Million Dollar Man dressed as a rap god
Test my religion, get baptized
Too many of us bit the dust for crumbs of crust
In God we trust, now watch it rust
Here when life ain’t even worth three loosies
A pair of chicken wings, cigarettes, two juices
They make new nooses, and everybody know what the truth is
And that’s what Black Thought from the Roots is


Around that time, moravar, one generally, for luvvomony hoped or at any rate suspected among morticians that he would early tum out badly, develop hereditary pulmonary T.B., and do for himself one dandy time, nay, of a pelting night blanketed creditors, hearing a coarse song and splash off Eden Quay sighed and rolled over, sure all was up, but, though he fell heavily and locally into debit, not even then could such an antinomian be true to type. He would not put fire to his cerebrum; he would not throw himself in Liffey; he would not explaud himself with pneumantics; he refused to saffrocake himself with a sod. With the foreign devil’s leave the fraid bom fraud diddled even death. Anzi, cabled (but shaking the worth out of his maulth: Guarda-costa leporello? Szasas Kraicz!) from his Nearapoblican asylum to his jonathan for a brother: Here tokay, gone tomory, we’re spluched, do something, Fireless. And had answer: Inconvenient, David.
You see, chaps, it will trickle out, freaksily of course, but the tom and the shorty of it is: he was in his bardic memory low. All the time he kept on treasuring with condign satisfaction each and every crumb of trektalk, covetous of his neighbour’s word, and if ever, during a Munda conversazione commoted in the nation’s interest, delicate tippits were thrown out to him touching his evil courses by some wellwishers, vainly pleading by scriptural arguments with the opprobrious papist about trying to brace up for the kidos of the thing, Scally wag, and be a men instead of a dem scrounger, dish it all, such as: Pray, what is the meaning, sousy, of that continental expression, if you ever came acrux it, we think it is a word transpiciously like canaille?: or: Did you anywhere, kennel, on your gullible’s travels or during your rural troubadouring, happen to stumble upon a certain gay young nobleman whimpering to the name of Low Swine who always addresses women out of the one comer of his mouth, lives on loans and is furtivefree yours of age? with-out one sigh of haste like the supreme prig he was, and not a bit sorry, he would pull a vacant landlubber’s face, root with ear-waker’s pensile in the outer of his lauscher and then, lisping, the prattlepate parnella, to kill time, and swatting his deadbest to think what under the canopies of Jansens Chrest would any decent son of an Albiogenselman who had bin to an university think, let a lent hit a hint and begin to tell all the intelligentsia admitted to that tamileasy samtalaisy conclamazzione (since, still and before physicians, lawyers merchant, belfry pollititians, agri-colous manufraudurers, sacrestanes of the Pure River Society, philanthropicks lodging on as many boards round the panesthetic at the same time as possible) the whole lifelong swrine story of his entire low cornaille existence, abusing his deceased ancestors wherever the sods were and one moment tarabooming great blunderguns (poh!) about his farfamed fine Poppamore, Mr Humhum, whom history, climate and entertainment made the first of his sept and always up to debt, though Eavens ears ow many fines he faces, and another moment visanvrerssas, cruaching three jeers (pah!) for his rotten little ghost of a Peppybeg, Mr Himmyshimmy, a blighty, a reeky, a lighty, a scrapy, a bab-bly, a ninny, dirty seventh among thieves and always bottom sawyer, till nowan knowed how howmely howme could be, giving unsolicited testimony on behalf of the absent, as glib as eaves — water to those present (who meanwhile, with increasing lack of interest in his semantics, allowed various subconscious smickers to drivel slowly across their fichers), unconsciously explaining, for inkstands, with a meticulosity bordering on the insane, the various meanings of all the different foreign parts of speech he misused and cuttlefishing every lie unshrinkable about all the other people in the story, leaving out, of course, foreconsciously, the simple worf and plague and poison they had cornered him about until there was not a snoozer among them but was utterly undeceived in the heel of the reel by the recital of the rigmarole.
He went without saying that the cull disliked anything anyway approaching a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row and, as often as he was called in to umpire any octagonal argu-ment among slangwhangers, the accomplished washout always used to rub shoulders with the last speaker and clasp shakers (the handtouch which is speech without words) and agree to every word as soon as half uttered, command me!, your servant, good, I revere you, how, my seer? be drinking that! quite truth, grati-as, I’m yoush, see wha’m hearing?, also goods, please it, me sure?, be filling this!, quiso, you said it, apasafello, muchas grassyass, is there firing-on-me?, is their girlic-on-you?, to your good self, your sulphur, and then at once focuss his whole unbalanced attention upon the next octagonist who managed to catch a listener’s eye, asking and imploring him out of his piteous onewinker, (hemoptysia diadumenos) whether there was anything in the world he could do to please him and to overflow his tumbletantaliser for him yet once more.
One hailcannon night (for his departure was attended by a heavy downpour) as very recently as some thousand rains ago he was therefore treated with what closely resembled parsonal viol-ence, being soggert all unsuspectingly through the deserted village of Tumblin-on-the-Leafy from Mr Vanhomrigh’s house at 81 bis Mabbot’s Mall as far as Green Patch beyond the brickfields of Salmon Pool by rival teams of slowspiers counter quicklimers who finally, as rahilly they had been deteened out rawther lae-tich, thought, busnis hits busnis, they had better be streaking for home after their Auborne-to-Auborne, with thanks for the pleasant evening, one and all disgustedly, instead of ruggering him back, and awake, reconciled (though they were as jealous as could be cullions about all the truffles they had brought on him) to a friendship, fast and furious, which merely arose out of the noxious pervert’s perfect lowness. Again there was a hope that people, looking on him with the contemp of the contempibles, after first gaving him a roll in the dirt, might pity and forgive him, if properly deloused, but the pleb was born a Quicklow and sank alowing till he stank out of sight.

O fortunous casualitas! Lefty takes the cherubcake while Rights cloves his hoof Darkies never done tug that coon out to play non-excretory, anti-sexuous, misoxenetic, gaasy pure, flesh and blood games, written and composed and sung and danced by Niscemus Nemon, same as piccaninnies play all day, those old (none of your honeys and rubbers!) games for fun and ele-ment we used to play with Dina and old Joe kicking her behind and before and the yellow girl kicking him behind old Joe, games like Thom Thom the Thonderman, Put the Wind up the Peeler, Hat in the Ring, Prisson your Pritchards and Play Withers Team, Mikel on the Luckypig, Nickel in the Slot, Sheila Harnett and her Cow, Adam and Ell, Humble Bumble, Moggie’s on the Wall, Twos and Threes, American Jump, Fox Come out of your Den, Broken Bottles, Writing a Letter to Punch, Tiptop is a Sweetstore, Henressy Crump Expolled, Postman’s Knock, Are We Fairlys Represented?, Solomon Silent reading, Appletree Bearstone, I know a Washer-woman, Hospitals, As I was Walking, There is Oneyone’s House in Dreamcolohour, Battle of Waterloo, Colours, Eggs in the Bush, Habberdasherisher, Telling your Dreams, What’s the Time, Nap, Ducking Mammy, Last Man Standing, Heali Baboon and the Forky Theagues, Fickleyes and Futilears, Handmarried but once in my Life and I’ll never commit such a Sin agin, Zip Cooney Candy, Turkey in the Straw, This is the Way we sow the Seed of a long and lusty Morning, Hops of Fun at Miliken’s Make, I seen the Tooth-brush with Pat Farrel, Here’s the Fat to graze the Priest’s Boots, When his Steam was like a Raimbrandt round Mac Garvey.
Now it is notoriously known how on that surprisingly bludgeony Unity Sunday when the grand germogall allstar bout was harrily the rage between our weltingtoms extraordinary and our petty-thicks the marshalaisy and Irish eyes of welcome were smiling daggers down their backs, when the roth, vice and blause met the noyr blank and rogues and the grim white and cold bet the black fighting tans, categorically unimperatived by the maxims, a rank funk getting the better of him, the scut in a bad fit of pyjamas fled like a leveret for his bare lives, to Talviland, ahone ahaza, pur-sued by the scented curses of all the village belles and, without having struck one blow, (pig stole on him was lust he lagging it was becaused dust he shook) kuskykorked himself up tight in his inkbattle house, badly the worse for boosegas, there to stay in afar for the life, where, as there was not a moment to be lost, after he had boxed around with his fortepiano till he was whole bach bamp him and bump him blues, he collapsed carefully under a bedtick from Schwitzer’s, his face enveloped into a dead war-rior’s telemac, with a lullobaw’s somnbomnet and a whotwater — wottle at his feet to stoke his energy of waiting, moaning feebly, in monkmarian monotheme, but tarned long and then a nation louder, while engaged in swallowing from a large ampullar, that his pawdry’s purgatory was more than a nigger bloke could bear, hemiparalysed by the tong warfare and all the shemozzle, (Daily Maily, fullup Lace! Holy Maly, Mothelup Joss!) his cheeks and trousers changing colour every time a gat croaked.
How is that for low, laities and gentlenuns? Why, dog of the Crostiguns, whole continents rang with this Kairokorran low-ness! Sheols of houris in chems upon divans, (revolted stellas vespertine vesamong them) at a bare (O!) mention of the scaly rybald exclaimed: Poisse!
But would anyone, short of a madhouse, believe it? Neither of those clean little cherubum, Nero or Nobookisonester himself, ever nursed such a spoiled opinion of his monstrous marvellosity as did this mental and moral defective (here perhaps at the vanessance of his lownest) who was known to grognt rather than gunnard upon one occasion, while drinking heavily of spirits to that interlocutor a latere and private privysuckatary he used to pal around with, in the kavehazs, one Davy Browne–Nowlan, his heavenlaid twin, (this hambone dogpoet pseudoed himself under the hangname he gave himself of Bethgelert) in the porchway of a gipsy’s bar (Shem always blaspheming, so holy writ, Billy, he would try, old Belly, and pay this one manjack congregant of his four soups every lass of nexmouth, Bolly, so sure as thair’s a tail on a commet, as a taste for storik’s fortytooth, that is to stay, to listen out, ony twenny minnies moe, Bully, his Ballade Imaginaire which was to be dubbed Wine, Woman and Water-clocks, or How a Guy Finks and Fawkes When He Is Going Batty, by Maistre Sheames de la Plume, some most dreadful stuff in a murderous mirrorhand) that he was avoopf (parn me!) aware of no other shaggspick, other Shakhisbeard, either prexactly unlike his polar andthisishis or procisely the seem as woops (parn!) as what he fancied or guessed the sames as he was him-self and that, greet scoot, duckings and thuggery, though he was foxed fux to fux like a bunnyboy rodger with all the teashop lionses of Lumdrum hivanhoesed up gagainst him, being a lapsis linquo with a ruvidubb shortartempa, bad cad dad fad sad mad nad vanhaty bear, the consciquenchers of casuality prepestered crusswords in postposition, scruff, scruffer, scrufferumurraimost andallthatsortofthing, if reams stood to reason and his lanka-livline lasted he would wipe alley english spooker, multapho — niaksically spuking, off the face of the erse.
After the thorough fright he got that bloody, Swithun’s day, though every doorpost in muchtried Lucalizod was smeared with generous erstborn gore and every free for all cobbleway slippery with the bloods of heroes, crying to Welkins for others, and noahs and cul verts agush with tears of joy, our low waster never had the common baalamb’s pluck to stir out and about the com-pound while everyone else of the torchlit throng, slashers and sliced alike, mobbu on massa, waaded and baaded around, yamp-yam pampyam, chanting the Gillooly chorus, from the Monster Book of Paltryattic Puetrie, O pura e pia bella! in junk et sampam or in secular sinkalarum, heads up, on his bonafide avocation (the little folk creeping on all fours to their natural school treat but childishly gleeful when a stray whizzer sang out intermediately) and happy belongers to the fairer sex on their usual quest for higher things, but vying with Lady Smythe to avenge Mac–Jobber, went stonestepping with their bickerrstaffs on educated feet, plinkity plonk, across the sevenspan ponte dei colori set up over the slop after the war-to-end war by Messrs a charitable government for the only once (dia dose Finnados!) he did take a tompip peepestrella throug a threedraw eighteen hawkspower durdicky telescope, luminous to larbourd only like the lamps in Nassaustrass, out of his westernmost keyhole, spitting at the impenetrablum wetter, (and it was porcoghastly that outumn) with an eachway hope in his shivering soul, as he prayed to the cloud Incertitude, of finding out for himself, on akkount of all the kules in Kroukaparka or oving to all the kodseoggs in Kalatavala, whether true conciliation was forging ahead or falling back after the celestious intemperance and, for Duvvelsache, why, with his see me see and his my see a corves and his frokerfoskerfuskar layen loves in meeingseeing, he got the charm of his optical life when he found himself (hic sunt lennones!) at pointblank range blinking down the barrel of an irregular revolver of the bulldog with a purpose pattern, handled by an unknown quarreler who, supposedly, had been told off to shade and shoot shy Shem should the shit show his shiny shnout out awhile to look facts in their face before being hosed and creased (uprip and jack him!) by six or a dozen of the gayboys.
What, para Saom Plaom, in the names of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and the incensed privy and the licensed pantry gods and Stator and Victor and Kutt and Runn and the whole mesa redonda of Lorencao Otulass in convocacaon, was this dis-interestingly low human type, this Calumnious Column of Cloaxity, this Bengalese Beacon of Biloxity, this Annamite Aper of Atroxity, really at, it will be precise to quarify, for he seems in a badbad case?
The answer, to do all the diddies in one dedal, would sound: from pulling himself on his most flavoured canal the huge chest-house of his elders (the Popapreta, and some navico, navvies!) he had flickered up and flinnered down into a drug and drunkery addict, growing megalomane of a loose past. This explains the litany of septuncial lettertrumpets honorific, highpitched, erudite, neoclassical, which he so loved as patricianly to manuscribe after his name. It would have diverted, if ever seen, the shuddersome spectacle of this semidemented zany amid the inspissated grime of his glaucous den making believe to read his usylessly unread-able Blue Book of Eccles, ‚dition de t‚nŠbres, (even yet sighs the Most Different, Dr. Poindejenk, authorised bowdler and censor, it can’t be repeated!) turning over three sheets at a wind, telling himself delightedly, no espellor mor so, that every splurge on the vellum he blundered over was an aisling vision more gorgeous than the one before t.i.t.s., a roseschelle cottage by the sea for nothing for ever, a ladies tryon hosiery raffle at liberty, a sewer-ful of guineagold wine with brancomongepadenopie and sick — cylinder oysters worth a billion a bite, an entire operahouse (there was to be stamping room only in the prompter’s box and everthemore his queque kept swelling) of enthusiastic noble-women flinging every coronetcrimsoned stitch they had off at his probscenium, one after the others, inamagoaded into ajustil-loosing themselves, in their gaiety pantheomime, when, egad, sir, acordant to all acountstrick, he squealed the topsquall im Deal Lil Shemlockup Yellin (geewhiz, jew ear that far! soap ewer! loutgout of sabaous! juice like a boyd!) for fully five minutes, infinitely better than Baraton Mc Gluckin with a scrumptious cocked hat and three green, cheese and tangerine trinity plumes on the right handle side of his amarellous head, a coat macfarlane (the kerssest cut, you understand?) a sponiard’s digger at his ribs, (Alfaiate punxit) an azulblu blowsheet for his blousebosom blossom and a dean’s crozier that he won from Cardinal Lin-dundarri and Cardinal Carchingarri and Cardinal Loriotuli and Cardinal Occidentaccia (ah ho!) in the dearby darby doubled for falling first over the hurdles, madam, in the odder hand, a.a.t.s.o.t., but what with the murky light, the botchy print, the tattered cover, the jigjagged page, the fumbling fingers, the foxtrotting fleas, the lieabed lice, the scum on his tongue, the drop in his eye, the lump in his throat, the drink in his pottle, the itch in his palm, the wail of his wind, the grief from his breath, the fog of his mindfag, the buzz in his braintree, the tic of his conscience, the height up his rage, the gush down his fundament, the fire in his gorge, the tickle of his tail, the bane in his bullugs, the squince in his suil, the rot in his eater, the ycho in his earer, the totters of his toes, the tetters on his tumtytum, the rats in his garret, the bats in his belfry, the budgerigars and bumbosolom beaubirds, the hullabaloo and the dust in his ears since it took him a month to steal a march he was hardset to mumorise more than a word a week. Hake’s haulin! Hook’s fisk! Can you beat it? Whawe! I say, can you bait it? Was there ever heard of such lowdown blackguardism? Positively it woolies one to think over it.
Yet the bumpersprinkler used to boast aloud alone to himself with a haccent on it when Mynfadher was a boer constructor and Hoy was a lexical student, parole, and corrected with the black- board (trying to copy the stage Englesemen he broughts their house down on, shouting: Bravure, surr Chorles! Letter purfect! Culossal, Loose Wallor! Spache!) how he had been toed out of all the schicker families of the klondykers from Pioupioureich, Swabspays, the land of Nod, Shruggers’ Country, Pension Danubierhome and Barbaropolis, who had settled and stratified in the capital city after its hebdomodary metropoliarchialisation as sunblistered, moonplastered, gory, wheedling, joviale, litche-rous and full, ordered off the gorgeous premises in most cases on account of his smell which all cookmaids eminently objected to as ressembling the bombinubble puzzo that welled out of the pozzo. Instead of chuthoring those model households plain wholesome pothooks (a thing he never possessed of his Nigerian own) what do you think Vulgariano did but study with stolen fruit how cutely to copy all their various styles of signature so as one day to utter an epical forged cheque on the public for his own private profit until, as just related, the Dustbin’s United Scullery-maid’s and Househelp’s Sorority, better known as Sluttery’s Mowlted Futt, turned him down and assisted nature by unitedly shoeing the source of annoyance out of the place altogether and taytotally on the heat of the moment, holding one another’s gonk (for no-one, hound or scrublady, not even the Turk, ungreekable in purscent of the armenable, dared whiff the polecat at close range) and making some pointopointing remarks as they done so at the perfects of the Sniffey, your honour, aboon the lyow why a stunk, mister.

One cannot even begin to post figure out a statuesquo ante as to how slow in reality the excommunicated Drumcondriac, nate Hamis, really was. Who can say how many pseudostylic shamiana, how few or how many of the most venerated public impostures, how very many piously forged palimpsests slipped in the first place by this morbid process from his pelagiarist pen?
Be that as it may, but for that light phantastic of his gnose’s glow as it slid lucifericiously within an inch of its page (he would touch at its from time to other, the red eye of his fear in saddishness, to ensign the colours by the beerlitz in his mathness and his educandees to outhue to themselves in the cries of girl-glee: gember! inkware! chonchambre! cinsero! zinnzabar! tinc — ture and gin!) Nibs never would have quilled a seriph to sheepskin. By that rosy lampoon’s effluvious burning and with help of the simulchronic flush in his pann (a ghinee a ghirk he ghets there!) he scrabbled and scratched and scriobbled and skrevened nameless shamelessness about everybody ever he met, even sharing a precipitation under the idlish tarriers’ umbrella of a showerproof wall, while all over up and down the four margins of this rancid Shem stuff the evilsmeller (who was devoted to Uldfadar Sardanapalus) used to stipple endlessly inartistic portraits of himself in the act of reciting old Nichiabelli’s monolook interyerear Hanno, o Nonanno, acce’l brubblemm’as, ser Autore, q.e.d., a heartbreakingly handsome young paolo with love lyrics for the goyls in his eyols, a plain-tiff’s tanner vuice, a jucal inkome of one hundred and thirtytwo dranchmas per yard from Broken Hill stranded estate, Came-breech mannings, cutting a great dash in a brandnew two guinea dress suit and a burled hogsford hired for a Fursday evenin merry pawty, anna loavely long pair of inky Italian moostarshes glistering with boric vaseline and frangipani. Puh! How unwhisperably so!
The house O’Shea or O’Shame, Quivapieno, known as the Haunted Inkbottle, no number Brimstone Walk, Asia in Ireland, as it was infested with the raps, with his penname SHUT sepia-scraped on the doorplate and a blind of black sailcloth over its wan phwinshogue, in which the soulcontracted son of the secret cell groped through life at the expense of the taxpayers, dejected into day and night with jesuit bark and bitter bite, calico- hydrants of zolfor and scoppialamina by full and forty Queasi-sanos, every day in everyone’s way more exceeding in violent abuse of self and others, was the worst, it is hoped, even in our western playboyish world for pure mousefarm filth. You brag of your brass castle or your tyled house in ballyfermont? Niggs, niggs and niggs again. For this was a stinksome inkenstink, quite puzzonal to the wrottel. Smatterafact, Angles aftanon browsing there thought not Edam reeked more rare. My wud! The warped flooring of the lair and soundconducting walls thereof, to say nothing of the uprights and imposts, were persianly literatured with burst loveletters, telltale stories, stickyback snaps, doubtful eggshells, bouchers, flints, borers, puffers, amygdaloid almonds, rindless raisins, alphybettyformed verbage, vivlical viasses, om-piter dictas, visus umbique, ahems and ahahs, imeffible tries at speech unasyllabled, you owe mes, eyoldhyms, fluefoul smut, fallen lucifers, vestas which had served, showered ornaments, borrowed brogues, reversibles jackets, blackeye lenses, family jars, falsehair shirts, Godforsaken scapulars, neverworn breeches, cutthroat ties, counterfeit franks, best intentions, curried notes, upset latten tintacks, unused mill and stumpling stones, twisted quills, painful digests, magnifying wineglasses, solid objects cast at goblins, once current puns, quashed quotatoes, messes of mot-tage, unquestionable issue papers, seedy ejaculations, limerick damns, crocodile tears, spilt ink, blasphematory spits, stale shest-nuts, schoolgirl’s, young ladies, milkmaids’, washerwomen’s, shopkeepers’ wives, merry widows’, ex nuns’, vice abbess’s, pro virgins’, super whores’, silent sisters’, Charleys’ aunts’, grand-mothers’, mothers’-inlaws, fostermothers’, godmothers’ garters, tress clippings from right, lift and cintrum, worms of snot, toothsome pickings, cans of Swiss condensed bilk, highbrow lotions, kisses from the antipodes, presents from pickpockets, borrowed plumes, relaxable handgrips, princess promises, lees of whine, deoxodised carbons, convertible collars, diviliouker doffers, broken wafers, unloosed shoe latchets, crooked strait waistcoats, fresh horrors from Hades, globules of mercury, undeleted glete, glass eyes for an eye, gloss teeth for a tooth, war moans, special sighs, longsufferings of longstanding, ahs ohs ouis sis jas jos gias neys thaws sos, yeses and yeses and yeses, to which, if one has the stomach to add the breakages, upheavals distortions, inversions of all this chambermade music one stands, given a grain of goodwill, a fair chance of actually seeing the whirling dervish, Tumult, son of Thunder, self exiled in upon his ego, a nightlong a shaking betwixtween white or reddr haw-rors, noondayterrorised to skin and bone by an ineluctable phan — tom (may the Shaper have mercery on him!) writing the mystery of himsel in furniture.
Of course our low hero was a self valeter by choice of need so up he got up whatever is meant by a stourbridge clay kitchen-ette and lithargogalenu fowlhouse for the sake of akes (the umpple does not fall very far from the dumpertree) which the moromelodious jigsmith, in defiance of the Uncontrollable Birth Preservativation (Game and Poultry) Act, playing lallaryrook cookerynook, by the dodginess of his lentern, brooled and cocked and potched in an athanor, whites and yolks and yilks and whotes to the frulling fredonnance of Mas blanca que la blanca hermana and Amarilla, muy bien, with cinnamon and locusts and wild bees-wax and liquorice and Carrageen moss and blaster of Barry’s and Asther’s mess and Huster’s micture and Yellownan’s embrocation and Pinkingtone’s patty and stardust and sinner’s tears, acuredent to Sharadan’s Art of Panning, chanting, for all regale to the like of the legs he left behind with Litty fun Letty fan Leven, his cantraps of fermented words, abracadabra calubra culorum, (his oewfs … la Madame Gabrielle de l’Eglise, his avgs … la Mistress B. de B. Meinfelde, his eiers Usquadmala … la pomme de ciel, his uoves, oves and uves … la Sulphate de Soude, his ochiuri sowtay sowmmonay a la Monseigneur, his soufflosion of oogs with somekat on toyast … la MŠre Puard, his Poggadovies alla Fenella, his Frideggs … la Tricarˆme) in what was meant for a closet (Ah ho! If only he had listened better to the four masters that infanted him Father Mathew and Le PŠre Noble and Pastor Lucas and Padre Aguilar — not forgetting Layteacher Baudwin! Ah ho!) His costive Satan’s antimonian manganese limolitmious nature never needed such an alcove so, when Robber and Mum-sell, the pulpic dictators, on the nudgment of their legal advisers, Messrs Codex and Podex, and under his own benefiction of their pastor Father Flammeus Falconer, boycotted him of all mutton-suet candles and romeruled stationery for any purpose, he winged away on a wildgoup’s chase across the kathartic ocean and made synthetic ink and sensitive paper for his own end out of his wit’s waste.

1 Contributor”Some People Push Back”: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens LyricsChurchill’s essay was written the day after the September 11, 2001 attacksWhen queried by reporters concerning his views on the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, Malcolm X famously – and quite charitably, all things considered – replied that it was merely a case of "chickens coming home to roost."
On the morning of September 11, 2001, a few more chickens – along with some half-million dead Iraqi children – came home to roost in a very big way at the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center. Well, actually, a few of them seem to have nestled in at the Pentagon as well.
The Iraqi youngsters, all of them under 12, died as a predictable – in fact, widely predicted – result of the 1991 US "surgical" bombing of their country's water purification and sewage facilities, as well as other "infrastructural" targets upon which Iraq's civilian population depends for its very survival.
If the nature of the bombing were not already bad enough – and it should be noted that this sort of "aerial warfare" constitutes a Class I Crime Against humanity, entailing myriad gross violations of international law, as well as every conceivable standard of "civilized" behavior – the death toll has been steadily ratcheted up by US-imposed sanctions for a full decade now. Enforced all the while by a massive military presence and periodic bombing raids, the embargo has greatly impaired the victims' ability to import the nutrients, medicines and other materials necessary to saving the lives of even their toddlers.
All told, Iraq has a population of about 18 million. The 500,000 kids lost to date thus represent something on the order of 25 percent of their age group. Indisputably, the rest have suffered – are still suffering – a combination of physical debilitation and psychological trauma severe enough to prevent their ever fully recovering. In effect, an entire generation has been obliterated.
The reason for this holocaust was/is rather simple, and stated quite straightforwardly by President George Bush, the 41st "freedom-loving" father of the freedom-lover currently filling the Oval Office, George the 43rd: "The world must learn that what we say, goes," intoned George the Elder to the enthusiastic applause of freedom-loving Americans everywhere. How Old George conveyed his message was certainly no mystery to the US public. One need only recall the 24-hour-per-day dissemination of bombardment videos on every available TV channel, and the exceedingly high ratings of these telecasts, to gain a sense of how much they knew.
In trying to affix a meaning to such things, we would do well to remember the wave of elation that swept America at reports of what was happening along the so-called Highway of Death: perhaps 100,000 "towel-heads" and "camel jockeys" – or was it "sand niggers" that week? – in full retreat, routed and effectively defenseless, many of them conscripted civilian laborers, slaughtered in a single day by jets firing the most hyper-lethal types of ordnance. It was a performance worthy of the nazis during the early months of their drive into Russia. And it should be borne in mind that Good Germans gleefully cheered that butchery, too. Indeed, support for Hitler suffered no serious erosion among Germany's "innocent civilians" until the defeat at Stalingrad.
There may be a real utility to reflecting further, this time upon the fact that it was pious Americans who led the way in assigning the onus of collective guilt to the German people as a whole, not for things they as individuals had done, but for what they had allowed – nay, empowered – their leaders and their soldiers to do in their name.
If the principle was valid then, it remains so now, as applicable to Good Americans as it was the Good Germans. And the price exacted from the Germans for the faultiness of their moral fiber was truly ghastly. Returning now to the children, and to the effects of the post-Gulf War embargo – continued bull force by Bush the Elder's successors in the Clinton administration as a gesture of its "resolve" to finalize what George himself had dubbed the "New World Order" of American military/economic domination – it should be noted that not one but two high United Nations officials attempting to coordinate delivery of humanitarian aid to Iraq resigned in succession as protests against US policy.
One of them, former U.N. Assistant Secretary General Denis Halladay, repeatedly denounced what was happening as "a systematic program . . . of deliberate genocide." His statements appeared in the New York Times and other papers during the fall of 1998, so it can hardly be contended that the American public was "unaware" of them. Shortly thereafter, Secretary of State Madeline Albright openly confirmed Halladay's assessment. Asked during the widely-viewed TV program Meet the Press to respond to his "allegations," she calmly announced that she'd decided it was "worth the price" to see that U.S. objectives were achieved.
The Politics of a Perpetrator Population
As a whole, the American public greeted these revelations with yawns.. There were, after all, far more pressing things than the unrelenting misery/death of a few hundred thousand Iraqi tikes to be concerned with. Getting "Jeremy" and "Ellington" to their weekly soccer game, for instance, or seeing to it that little "Tiffany" and "Ashley" had just the right roll-neck sweaters to go with their new cords. And, to be sure, there was the yuppie holy war against ashtrays – for "our kids," no less – as an all-absorbing point of political focus.
In fairness, it must be admitted that there was an infinitesimally small segment of the body politic who expressed opposition to what was/is being done to the children of Iraq. It must also be conceded, however, that those involved by-and-large contented themselves with signing petitions and conducting candle-lit prayer vigils, bearing "moral witness" as vast legions of brown-skinned five-year-olds sat shivering in the dark, wide-eyed in horror, whimpering as they expired in the most agonizing ways imaginable.
Be it said as well, and this is really the crux of it, that the "resistance" expended the bulk of its time and energy harnessed to the systemically-useful task of trying to ensure, as "a principle of moral virtue" that nobody went further than waving signs as a means of "challenging" the patently exterminatory pursuit of Pax Americana. So pure of principle were these "dissidents," in fact, that they began literally to supplant the police in protecting corporations profiting by the carnage against suffering such retaliatory "violence" as having their windows broken by persons less "enlightened" – or perhaps more outraged – than the self-anointed "peacekeepers."
Property before people, it seems – or at least the equation of property to people – is a value by no means restricted to America's boardrooms. And the sanctimony with which such putrid sentiments are enunciated turns out to be nauseatingly similar, whether mouthed by the CEO of Standard Oil or any of the swarm of comfort zone "pacifists" queuing up to condemn the black block after it ever so slightly disturbed the functioning of business-as-usual in Seattle.
Small wonder, all-in-all, that people elsewhere in the world – the Mideast, for instance – began to wonder where, exactly, aside from the streets of the US itself, one was to find the peace America's purportedly oppositional peacekeepers claimed they were keeping.
The answer, surely, was plain enough to anyone unblinded by the kind of delusions engendered by sheer vanity and self-absorption. So, too, were the implications in terms of anything changing, out there, in America's free-fire zones.
Tellingly, it was at precisely this point – with the genocide in Iraq officially admitted and a public response demonstrating beyond a shadow of a doubt that there were virtually no Americans, including most of those professing otherwise, doing anything tangible to stop it – that the combat teams which eventually commandeered the aircraft used on September 11 began to infiltrate the United States.
Meet the "Terrorists"
Of the men who came, there are a few things demanding to be said in the face of the unending torrent of disinformational drivel unleashed by George Junior and the corporate "news" media immediately following their successful operation on September 11.
They did not, for starters, "initiate" a war with the US, much less commit "the first acts of war of the new millennium."
A good case could be made that the war in which they were combatants has been waged more-or-less continuously by the "Christian West" – now proudly emblematized by the United States – against the "Islamic East" since the time of the First Crusade, about 1,000 years ago. More recently, one could argue that the war began when Lyndon Johnson first lent significant support to Israel's dispossession/displacement of Palestinians during the 1960s, or when George the Elder ordered "Desert Shield" in 1990, or at any of several points in between. Any way you slice it, however, if what the combat teams did to the WTC and the Pentagon can be understood as acts of war – and they can – then the same is true of every US "overflight' of Iraqi territory since day one. The first acts of war during the current millennium thus occurred on its very first day, and were carried out by U.S. aviators acting under orders from their then-commander-in-chief, Bill Clinton. The most that can honestly be said of those involved on September 11 is that they finally responded in kind to some of what this country has dispensed to their people as a matter of course.
That they waited so long to do so is, notwithstanding the 1993 action at the WTC, more than anything a testament to their patience and restraint.
They did not license themselves to "target innocent civilians."
There is simply no argument to be made that the Pentagon personnel killed on September 11 fill that bill. The building and those inside comprised military targets, pure and simple. As to those in the World Trade Center . . .
Well, really. Let's get a grip here, shall we? True enough, they were civilians of a sort. But innocent? Gimme a break. They formed a technocratic corps at the very heart of America's global financial empire – the "mighty engine of profit" to which the military dimension of U.S. policy has always been enslaved – and they did so both willingly and knowingly. Recourse to "ignorance" – a derivative, after all, of the word "ignore" – counts as less than an excuse among this relatively well-educated elite. To the extent that any of them were unaware of the costs and consequences to others of what they were involved in – and in many cases excelling at – it was because of their absolute refusal to see. More likely, it was because they were too busy braying, incessantly and self-importantly, into their cell phones, arranging power lunches and stock transactions, each of which translated, conveniently out of sight, mind and smelling distance, into the starved and rotting flesh of infants. If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon the little Eichmanns inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of the twin towers, I'd really be interested in hearing about it.
The men who flew the missions against the WTC and Pentagon were not "cowards." That distinction properly belongs to the "firm-jawed lads" who delighted in flying stealth aircraft through the undefended airspace of Baghdad, dropping payload after payload of bombs on anyone unfortunate enough to be below – including tens of thousands of genuinely innocent civilians – while themselves incurring all the risk one might expect during a visit to the local video arcade. Still more, the word describes all those "fighting men and women" who sat at computer consoles aboard ships in the Persian Gulf, enjoying air-conditioned comfort while launching cruise missiles into neighborhoods filled with random human beings. Whatever else can be said of them, the men who struck on September 11 manifested the courage of their convictions, willingly expending their own lives in attaining their objectives.
Nor were they "fanatics" devoted to "Islamic fundamentalism."
One might rightly describe their actions as "desperate." Feelings of desperation, however, are a perfectly reasonable – one is tempted to say "normal" – emotional response among persons confronted by the mass murder of their children, particularly when it appears that nobody else really gives a damn (ask a Jewish survivor about this one, or, even more poignantly, for all the attention paid them, a Gypsy).
That desperate circumstances generate desperate responses is no mysterious or irrational principle, of the sort motivating fanatics. Less is it one peculiar to Islam. Indeed, even the FBI's investigative reports on the combat teams' activities during the months leading up to September 11 make it clear that the members were not fundamentalist Muslims. Rather, it's pretty obvious at this point that they were secular activists – soldiers, really – who, while undoubtedly enjoying cordial relations with the clerics of their countries, were motivated far more by the grisly realities of the U.S. war against them than by a set of religious beliefs.
And still less were they/their acts "insane."
Insanity is a condition readily associable with the very American idea that one – or one's country – holds what amounts to a "divine right" to commit genocide, and thus to forever do so with impunity. The term might also be reasonably applied to anyone suffering genocide without attempting in some material way to bring the process to a halt. Sanity itself, in this frame of reference, might be defined by a willingness to try and destroy the perpetrators and/or the sources of their ability to commit their crimes. (Shall we now discuss the US "strategic bombing campaign" against Germany during World War II, and the mental health of those involved in it?)
Which takes us to official characterizations of the combat teams as an embodiment of "evil."
Evil – for those inclined to embrace the banality of such a concept – was perfectly incarnated in that malignant toad known as Madeline Albright, squatting in her studio chair like Jaba the Hutt, blandly spewing the news that she'd imposed a collective death sentence upon the unoffending youth of Iraq. Evil was to be heard in that great American hero "Stormin' Norman" Schwartzkopf's utterly dehumanizing dismissal of their systematic torture and annihilation as mere "collateral damage." Evil, moreover, is a term appropriate to describing the mentality of a public that finds such perspectives and the policies attending them acceptable, or even momentarily tolerable.
Had it not been for these evils, the counterattacks of September 11 would never have occurred. And unless "the world is rid of such evil," to lift a line from George Junior, September 11 may well end up looking like a lark.
There is no reason, after all, to believe that the teams deployed in the assaults on the WTC and the Pentagon were the only such, that the others are composed of "Arabic-looking individuals" – America's indiscriminately lethal arrogance and psychotic sense of self-entitlement have long since given the great majority of the world's peoples ample cause to be at war with it – or that they are in any way dependent upon the seizure of civilian airliners to complete their missions.
To the contrary, there is every reason to expect that there are many other teams in place, tasked to employ altogether different tactics in executing operational plans at least as well-crafted as those evident on September 11, and very well equipped for their jobs. This is to say that, since the assaults on the WTC and Pentagon were act of war – not "terrorist incidents" – they must be understood as components in a much broader strategy designed to achieve specific results. From this, it can only be adduced that there are plenty of other components ready to go, and that they will be used, should this become necessary in the eyes of the strategists. It also seems a safe bet that each component is calibrated to inflict damage at a level incrementally higher than the one before (during the 1960s, the Johnson administration employed a similar policy against Vietnam, referred to as "escalation").
Since implementation of the overall plan began with the WTC/Pentagon assaults, it takes no rocket scientist to decipher what is likely to happen next, should the U.S. attempt a response of the inexcusable variety to which it has long entitled itself.
About Those Boys (and Girls) in the Bureau
There's another matter begging for comment at this point. The idea that the FBI's "counterterrorism task forces" can do a thing to prevent what will happen is yet another dimension of America's delusional pathology.. The fact is that, for all its publicly-financed "image-building" exercises, the Bureau has never shown the least aptitude for anything of the sort.
Oh, yeah, FBI counterintelligence personnel have proven quite adept at framing anarchists, communists and Black Panthers, sometimes murdering them in their beds or the electric chair. The Bureau's SWAT units have displayed their ability to combat child abuse in Waco by burning babies alive, and its vaunted Crime Lab has been shown to pad its "crime-fighting' statistics by fabricating evidence against many an alleged car thief. But actual "heavy-duty bad guys" of the sort at issue now? This isn't a Bruce Willis/Chuck Norris/Sly Stallone movie, after all.. And J. Edgar Hoover doesn't get to approve either the script or the casting.
The number of spies, saboteurs and bona fide terrorists apprehended, or even detected by the FBI in the course of its long and slimy history could be counted on one's fingers and toes. On occasion, its agents have even turned out to be the spies, and, in many instances, the terrorists as well.
To be fair once again, if the Bureau functions as at best a carnival of clowns where its "domestic security responsibilities" are concerned, this is because – regardless of official hype – it has none. It is now, as it's always been, the national political police force, an instrument created and perfected to ensure that all Americans, not just the consenting mass, are "free" to do exactly as they're told.
The FBI and "cooperating agencies" can be thus relied upon to set about "protecting freedom" by destroying whatever rights and liberties were left to U.S. citizens before September 11 (in fact, they've already received authorization to begin). Sheeplike, the great majority of Americans can also be counted upon to bleat their approval, at least in the short run, believing as they always do that the nasty implications of what they're doing will pertain only to others.
Oh Yeah, and "The Company," Too
A possibly even sicker joke is the notion, suddenly in vogue, that the CIA will be able to pinpoint "terrorist threats," "rooting out their infrastructure" where it exists and/or "terminating" it before it can materialize, if only it's allowed to beef up its "human intelligence gathering capacity" in an unrestrained manner (including full-bore operations inside the US, of course).
Yeah. Right.
Since America has a collective attention-span of about 15 minutes, a little refresher seems in order: "The Company" had something like a quarter-million people serving as "intelligence assets" by feeding it information in Vietnam in 1968, and it couldn't even predict the Tet Offensive. God knows how many spies it was fielding against the USSR at the height of Ronald Reagan's version of the Cold War, and it was still caught flatfooted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. As to destroying "terrorist infrastructures," one would do well to remember Operation Phoenix, another product of its open season in Vietnam. In that one, the CIA enlisted elite US units like the Navy Seals and Army Special Forces, as well as those of friendly countries – the south Vietnamese Rangers, for example, and Australian SAS – to run around "neutralizing" folks targeted by The Company's legion of snitches as "guerrillas" (as those now known as "terrorists" were then called).
Sound familiar?
Upwards of 40,000 people – mostly bystanders, as it turns out – were murdered by Phoenix hit teams before the guerrillas, stronger than ever, ran the US and its collaborators out of their country altogether. And these are the guys who are gonna save the day, if unleashed to do their thing in North America?
The net impact of all this "counterterrorism" activity upon the combat teams' ability to do what they came to do, of course, will be nil.
Instead, it's likely to make it easier for them to operate (it's worked that way in places like Northern Ireland). And, since denying Americans the luxury of reaping the benefits of genocide in comfort was self-evidently a key objective of the WTC/Pentagon assaults, it can be stated unequivocally that a more overt display of the police state mentality already pervading this country simply confirms the magnitude of their victory.
On Matters of Proportion and Intent
As things stand, including the 1993 detonation at the WTC, "Arab terrorists" have responded to the massive and sustained American terror bombing of Iraq with a total of four assaults by explosives inside the US. That's about 1% of the 50,000 bombs the Pentagon announced were rained on Baghdad alone during the Gulf War (add in Oklahoma City and you'll get something nearer an actual 1%).
They've managed in the process to kill about 5,000 Americans, or roughly 1% of the dead Iraqi children (the percentage is far smaller if you factor in the killing of adult Iraqi civilians, not to mention troops butchered as/after they'd surrendered and/or after the "war-ending" ceasefire had been announced).
In terms undoubtedly more meaningful to the property/profit-minded American mainstream, they've knocked down a half-dozen buildings – albeit some very well-chosen ones – as opposed to the "strategic devastation" visited upon the whole of Iraq, and punched a $100 billion hole in the earnings outlook of major corporate shareholders, as opposed to the U.S. obliteration of Iraq's entire economy.
With that, they've given Americans a tiny dose of their own medicine.. This might be seen as merely a matter of "vengeance" or "retribution," and, unquestionably, America has earned it, even if it were to add up only to something so ultimately petty.
The problem is that vengeance is usually framed in terms of "getting even," a concept which is plainly inapplicable in this instance. As the above data indicate, it would require another 49,996 detonations killing 495,000 more Americans, for the "terrorists" to "break even" for the bombing of Baghdad/extermination of Iraqi children alone. And that's to achieve "real number" parity. To attain an actual proportional parity of damage – the US is about 15 times as large as Iraq in terms of population, even more in terms of territory – they would, at a minimum, have to blow up about 300,000 more buildings and kill something on the order of 7.5 million people.
Were this the intent of those who've entered the US to wage war against it, it would remain no less true that America and Americans were only receiving the bill for what they'd already done. Payback, as they say, can be a real motherfucker (ask the Germans). There is, however, no reason to believe that retributive parity is necessarily an item on the agenda of those who planned the WTC/Pentagon operation. If it were, given the virtual certainty that they possessed the capacity to have inflicted far more damage than they did, there would be a lot more American bodies lying about right now.
Hence, it can be concluded that ravings carried by the "news" media since September 11 have contained at least one grain of truth: The peoples of the Mideast "aren't like" Americans, not least because they don't "value life' in the same way. By this, it should be understood that Middle-Easterners, unlike Americans, have no history of exterminating others purely for profit, or on the basis of racial animus. Thus, we can appreciate the fact that they value life – all lives, not just their own – far more highly than do their U.S. counterparts.
The Makings of a Humanitarian Strategy
In sum one can discern a certain optimism – it might even be call humanitarianism – imbedded in the thinking of those who presided over the very limited actions conducted on September 11.
Their logic seems to have devolved upon the notion that the American people have condoned what has been/is being done in their name – indeed, are to a significant extent actively complicit in it – mainly because they have no idea what it feels like to be on the receiving end.
Now they do.
That was the "medicinal" aspect of the attacks.
To all appearances, the idea is now to give the tonic a little time to take effect, jolting Americans into the realization that the sort of pain they're now experiencing first-hand is no different from – or the least bit more excruciating than – that which they've been so cavalier in causing others, and thus to respond appropriately.
More bluntly, the hope was – and maybe still is – that Americans, stripped of their presumed immunity from incurring any real consequences for their behavior, would comprehend and act upon a formulation as uncomplicated as "stop killing our kids, if you want your own to be safe."
Either way, it's a kind of "reality therapy" approach, designed to afford the American people a chance to finally "do the right thing" on their own, without further coaxing.
Were the opportunity acted upon in some reasonably good faith fashion – a sufficiently large number of Americans rising up and doing whatever is necessary to force an immediate lifting of the sanctions on Iraq, for instance, or maybe hanging a few of America's abundant supply of major war criminals (Henry Kissinger comes quickly to mind, as do Madeline Albright, Colin Powell, Bill Clinton and George the Elder) – there is every reason to expect that military operations against the US on its domestic front would be immediately suspended.
Whether they would remain so would of course be contingent upon follow-up. By that, it may be assumed that American acceptance of onsite inspections by international observers to verify destruction of its weapons of mass destruction (as well as dismantlement of all facilities in which more might be manufactured), Nuremberg-style trials in which a few thousand US military/corporate personnel could be properly adjudicated and punished for their Crimes Against humanity, and payment of reparations to the array of nations/peoples whose assets the US has plundered over the years, would suffice.
Since they've shown no sign of being unreasonable or vindictive, it may even be anticipated that, after a suitable period of adjustment and reeducation (mainly to allow them to acquire the skills necessary to living within their means), those restored to control over their own destinies by the gallant sacrifices of the combat teams the WTC and Pentagon will eventually (re)admit Americans to the global circle of civilized societies. Stranger things have happened.
In the Alternative
Unfortunately, noble as they may have been, such humanitarian aspirations were always doomed to remain unfulfilled. For it to have been otherwise, a far higher quality of character and intellect would have to prevail among average Americans than is actually the case. Perhaps the strategists underestimated the impact a couple of generations-worth of media indoctrination can produce in terms of demolishing the capacity of human beings to form coherent thoughts. Maybe they forgot to factor in the mind-numbing effects of the indoctrination passed off as education in the US. Then, again, it's entirely possible they were aware that a decisive majority of American adults have been reduced by this point to a level much closer to the kind of immediate self-gratification entailed in Pavlovian stimulus/response patterns than anything accessible by appeals to higher logic, and still felt morally obliged to offer the dolts an option to quit while they were ahead.
What the hell? It was worth a try.
But it's becoming increasingly apparent that the dosage of medicine administered was entirely insufficient to accomplish its purpose.
Although there are undoubtedly exceptions, Americans for the most part still don't get it.
Already, they've desecrated the temporary tomb of those killed in the WTC, staging a veritable pep rally atop the mangled remains of those they profess to honor, treating the whole affair as if it were some bizarre breed of contact sport. And, of course, there are the inevitable pom-poms shaped like American flags, the school colors worn as little red-white-and-blue ribbons affixed to labels, sportscasters in the form of "counterterrorism experts" drooling mindless color commentary during the pregame warm-up.
Refusing the realization that the world has suddenly shifted its axis, and that they are therefore no longer "in charge," they have by-and-large reverted instantly to type, working themselves into their usual bloodlust on the now obsolete premise that the bloodletting will "naturally" occur elsewhere and to someone else.
"Patriotism," a wise man once observed, "is the last refuge of scoundrels."
And the braided, he might of added.
Braided Scoundrel-in-Chief, George Junior, lacking even the sense to be careful what he wished for, has teamed up with a gaggle of fundamentalist Christian clerics like Billy Graham to proclaim a "New Crusade" called "Infinite Justice" aimed at "ridding the world of evil."
One could easily make light of such rhetoric, remarking upon how unseemly it is for a son to threaten his father in such fashion – or a president to so publicly contemplate the murder/suicide of himself and his cabinet – but the matter is deadly serious.
They are preparing once again to sally forth for the purpose of roasting brown-skinned children by the scores of thousands. Already, the B-1 bombers and the aircraft carriers and the missile frigates are en route, the airborne divisions are gearing up to go.
To where? Afghanistan?
The Sudan?
Iraq, again (or still)?
How about Grenada (that was fun)?
Any of them or all. It doesn't matter.
The desire to pummel the helpless runs rabid as ever.
Only, this time it's different.
The time the helpless aren't, or at least are not so helpless as they were.
This time, somewhere, perhaps in an Afghani mountain cave, possibly in a Brooklyn basement, maybe another local altogether – but somewhere, all the same – there's a grim-visaged (wo)man wearing a Clint Eastwood smile.
"Go ahead, punks," s/he's saying, "Make my day."
And when they do, when they launch these airstrikes abroad – or may a little later; it will be at a time conforming to the "terrorists"' own schedule, and at a place of their choosing – the next more intensive dose of medicine administered here "at home."
Of what will it consist this time? Anthrax? Mustard gas? Sarin? A tactical nuclear device?
That, too, is their choice to make.
Looking back, it will seem to future generations inexplicable why Americans were unable on their own, and in time to save themselves, to accept a rule of nature so basic that it could be mouthed by an actor, Lawrence Fishburn, in a movie, The Cotton Club.
"You've got to learn, " the line went, "that when you push people around, some people push back."
As they should.
As they must.
And as they undoubtedly will.
There is justice in such symmetry.
ADDENDUM
The preceding was a "first take" reading, more a stream-of-consciousness interpretive reaction to the September 11 counterattack than a finished piece on the topic. Hence, I'll readily admit that I've been far less than thorough, and quite likely wrong about a number of things.
For instance, it may not have been (only) the ghosts of Iraqi children who made their appearance that day. It could as easily have been some or all of their butchered Palestinian cousins.
Or maybe it was some or all of the at least 3.2 million Indochinese who perished as a result of America's sustained and genocidal assault on Southeast Asia (1959-1975), not to mention the millions more who've died because of the sanctions imposed thereafter.
Perhaps there were a few of the Korean civilians massacred by US troops at places like No Gun Ri during the early ‘50s, or the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians ruthlessly incinerated in the ghastly fire raids of World War II (only at Dresden did America bomb Germany in a similar manner).
And, of course, it could have been those vaporized in the militarily pointless nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
There are others, as well, a vast and silent queue of faceless victims, stretching from the million-odd Filipinos slaughtered during America's "Indian War" in their islands at the beginning of the twentieth century, through the real Indians, America's own, massacred wholesale at places like Horseshoe Bend and the Bad Axe, Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, the Washita, Bear River, and the Marias.
Was it those who expired along the Cherokee Trial of Tears of the Long Walk of the Navajo?
Those murdered by smallpox at Fort Clark in 1836?
Starved to death in the concentration camp at Bosque Redondo during the 1860s?
Maybe those native people claimed for scalp bounty in all 48 of the continental US states? Or the Raritans whose severed heads were kicked for sport along the streets of what was then called New Amsterdam, at the very site where the WTC once stood?
One hears, too, the whispers of those lost on the Middle Passage, and of those whose very flesh was sold in the slave market outside the human kennel from whence Wall Street takes its name. And of coolie laborers, imported by the gross-dozen to lay the tracks of empire across scorching desert sands, none of them allotted "a Chinaman's chance" of surviving.
The list is too long, too awful to go on.
No matter what its eventual fate, America will have gotten off very, very cheap.
The full measure of its guilt can never be fully balanced or atoned
