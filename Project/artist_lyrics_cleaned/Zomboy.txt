 Yo! I called Chess like, "Yo cuz. Surf in this town locked."
 "Ain't that battle next week?"
 "Yeah that shit put me in wild spot."
 "Fuck you gon' do?"
 "I'm still slidin', is you down Aak?"
 "Like fossils, it's nothin' to get these fishy niggas found Roc(k)."
BANG BANG!
 Loud Glocks
 Bow! Bow!
 Wild chops
 {whistles}
 A child shot
 Hollow brains on Lux
 I spill sauce on a GOAT like a halal spot
 Get done Loaded
 The gun loaded
 I drum roll it
 I hit Loaded
 I'll reload it
 Then unload it
 You know what else Loaded?
 The pistol before I pull and squeeze
 You know what else Hollow?
 Shells after the bullets leave
 Look at these
 I switch the cannons like Mega Man
 My cat's can (CAT scan) expose ya top
 You need ya head examined
 The Beretta blam
 .9 to his brain, ya mama in pain
 The shit'll ache her (acre) so much
 She'll start sellin' land
 Big blade
 Freddy hands
 Chopper's on me
 Edward hands
 Trash day
 Hella cans
 Old cartridge
 Sega fans
 Ring on 'em
 Wedding bands
 Give you K's (UK's)
 Neverland
 Point at his bitch
 The heffer ran
 But I caught her (quarter)
 Seven grams
I'm a lost nigga and I don't follow no rules
 I'll walk up to this old dude
 And punch him like ProTools
 Hold ya granny for ransom
If I don't get my doe soon
 Then ya grandma will lose her leg like Soul Food
 Chill Roc we goin' postal
 Nigga that's cause 'pose to
 Well fuck it I'm bringin' poles too
 And you ain't gettin' up Loaded
 But ya picture gettin' uploaded with "R.I.P." attached
 And I'll be laughin' on that post too
Aye, he rode through, clap his whip
 The MAC'll flip
 Think 18 wheelers crash and shit
 That's Loaded truck in an accident
You- you- you preachin' ass nigga
 You leanin' ass nigga
 Hollow always find his way back to the activist (Actavis)
 This cat a bitch
We pull up to his crib like, "Is Hollow home?"
 His mom answer the door like, "Nah I'm in the spot alone."
 That bitch thinkin' we prolly tryin' to bone
 I pull an instrument out
 And bring a stick across like a xylophone
I pull strings, we in front ya door wit' the hoodies lowered
 I quiet Lux's, his jaw get wired shut, he should've closed it
 Hollows hittin' him and Hollow while he pullin' Loaded
 A potato for the silencer
 And I'll put it on a fully, Loaded
 Chill Roc, this a bully moment
Try to play with a youngin'
Scope on a gun, cause I don't have to chase if he gunnin'
AK to his stomach
 Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey
 That's a case for Beloved
 I'll wave it in public
 Brrrrrrrrrr
 All Hell raises
 {Gun shot}
 Them the 12 gauges
 {Chess releases the gun shells hid in his fist and drops them on the stage, and Tay Roc pulls some shells from his back pocket and drops them}
 Them the shell cases
 Slugs on the ground like snail races
 Boy, I will grip a Hawk
 Hit ya heart
 Twist the Hawk
 That shit is sharp
 Pull it out to hit him three more times
 In a different part
 I'll gun butt him, split his skull
 His vision dark
 It's gonna look like a Chinese divorce
 His Chin split apart
 Beefin' wit' me? Like listening to a song on repeat
 Why?
 Just when they thought it was over the shit restart
 For them slick remarks, I lift and spark
 Leave niggas chalked, he saw a van go (Van Gogh)
 With this AR, tee's (ART) get painted, this is art
 If niggas smart, take me directly to what's in the vault
In ya step, you better put some pep or (pepper)
 It's assault (a salt)
 I bet niggas walk, 'til a pound pulled off with a bigger buck
 Shots will be flyin', Roc in ya mind
 I'm in ya thoughts
I come to ya funeral, wait 'til that moment of silence
 Nigga I begin to talk and hit the rev up
 Like my foot on the gas
 While the cars still in park
 Who told you you could swim wit' sharks?
 Cake niggas
 Cave niggas
 Life line
 Gang members
 You ain't wit' us-
 You ain't livin'
 Body
 After body
 After body
 We shape shiftin'
 Gang shit!

 This here wasn't even for you lil' nigga
 Nah uh. Really wasn't. Really wasn't
 And now the brother gon' catch it on Show and 'em
 So let me get this straight...lil' bro' and them...went and got...
 Lil' bro and them
 Well it do make sense, Roc requestin' the youth
I reckon, who wouldn't with death in they view, shoot
 I heard they treasure Chess (chest)
 Well we gon' bury him too
We came to take the house
 But we couldn't get the Title lift
 We just gon' tear his top too
 Cool, they done made the final list (finalist)
 What's symbolic is they see old men
 Nigga I see omens
 But don't think everybody who play along knows (nose) what kind of sign this (sinus) is, nigga
 (Let's get loopy, let's get loopy)
 This is different type of energy
 Yes it is
 So don't ever mention chemistry
 To a motherfuckin' scientist
Who buyin' this on you lil' niggas?
 Look, look, look, I'm here to heart check Roc
 Oh, like a cardiologist?
 Nah nigga, I'm talkin' really checkin' this pussy
 Nigga that's a gynecologist
 No, I'm talkin' stray hand (Strahan), Giant grip, the D.E. Lion (lying) shit
 Oh you ain't Lion/lyin', bro that's a fire flip king
 Good lookin', good lookin'
 But I done got more civil writing (righting) these non violent scripts, I'm not gon' lie
 I'm confused, cause you the first one that gave Roc to Clips, nigga I'm positive
 But now I'm positive, you know, like the Nas of this nigga
 Nigga nah it's this, I ain't wit' all that, we on SMACK, nigga let's talk straps
But since I trust my partner, cool, I'ma fall back
{Hollow does a trust fall into Lux, who yells back, "I caught that!"}
 Let me get this straight, you done followed the business model, nigga
 Yeah, yeah, yeah and one more thing, don't be the next nigga to catch a Hollow
 Bro, I ain't trippin' that was dope but I thought you put down the bottle
 I mean you see I'm still eatin' lean
 Wow, that was mean
 That reminds me of a vegan scheme
I wanna mix it with they Shumpert and Beasley king
 Healthy!
 Squash that, cause if I get to Wild 'N Out I might even hit Chico Beans
This is for the spinach, so on cam' this ain't gonna look kinda close
 Right!
 And if it look like we got the beats (beets) then Avocado's toast!
 Healthy!
Bro, this is about us nigga, never them
 You ain't lyin' you the one who put him up in the Den
 I did give Roc the introduction to win
 I heard Everybody Loves Raymond
 'Til you gotta dance with the one who Usher's you in
{Hollow starts dancing on stage. Chess motions to Lux to look at Hollow's shoe he left on the stage}
 You comin' out ya shoe and shit. What is you doin' bro?
 What? I thought it was hot
 Comin' out ya shoe and shit, bro chill man, let's work
 I mean I know this is foolishness, but, why we doin' Usher?
 We should be doin' Goodie Mob cause we don't dance nigga, all we do is this (diss)
ALL we do is diss
 But we doin' this for the fans in Charlotte, why we mentioning Atlanta artists?
 You right, that is kinda ludicrous (Ludacris)
But you know they gonna bring up that movie shit
 Well they gon' get Bodied takin' business advances personal
 But from one foot on the stage to two in the grave
 You niggas wouldn't even have a chance in a commercial
 Awww shit
 I'm not excited neither
 We was quarterbackin' this shit, aye aye, when I come off the snap that's an uphill battle
 Wait, wait, wait, so now we hikin'?
 No, it just means a young cat will (cattle) look like he gettin' bull-ied
 Well that's a bison
 No Roc gon' get whipped for that backlash
And we ain't white men
 We in the house
 Fuck how you feel
...There we go actin' light skinned
As long as y'all keep Smack happy, y'all keep ya life
 That's facts
 Shit won't get trife
 That's a fact
 Then I hope Lux hearin' me
 Oh I hear ya nigga...
 Oh shit
 You know what the problem is witchu lil' niggas?
You think you know everything about the damn world...and you don't know shit
Now Roc I see you got yourself assist- I mean an assistant
But you'se a sucka
Aye Gunz N Ca-
It's two things you need to know about this world nigga
 What's that?
 There's two types of niggas in this world nigga
It's the niggas wit' the guns and the niggas wit' the butter
But uh...
We don't expect Cave niggas to see the light
 You young dumb mothafuckas
 Fuck outta here
 Pussy, you made a statement sayin' "stand up niggas don't lean."
Yeah, everything 'Healthy'
 Except his partner, he's a whole fiend
 Vegan and an addict
 Yeah them niggas probably put protein in they codeine
 These cameras won't stop us from causing a whole scene
 I let it fly in his window
 You ain't protected by no screens
I wish you would try me
 Everything 'Healthy'?
 All that mean to us is a good body
 Battle rappin' for 40 years don't mean your pen is elite
 Y'all niggas chemistry stink
 Aye, if I send him up and you down Loaded (downloaded)  How is you niggas in sync?
 And bitch if it's beef
 Pussy I'll spit in the shit that he eat
 And I'll hok spit in the shit that he drink
Toothpick in the head
{Hollow attempts to hand Chess his bottle of water. Chess hands it back, telling him to drink it.}
 Bitch if it's beef
 And bitch if it's beef
 I'll piss in the shit that he drink
 And I'll hok spit in the shit that he eat
 Toothpick in his niece
  comb in her head
 A few roots missin' at least
Broomstick in the cheeks
 You give her the knife
 Well you give her the piece
 I got it
 Then pistol whip her until
 'Til what?
 'Til the tool missin' a piece
 Like shots meet her (meter) from 2K's
 Soon as I get the green light I'm hittin' release
 Aye bro, training partners
 I spot him he gettin' ripped
 Nah, camp on him
 It's about to get real intense (in tents)
 Nah, Transformers
 I will body him in his whip
 Make A Wish Foundation
 This kid dyin' to get him picked

 Slide me some info
 Home invasions
 In ya spot, Glocks with extendos
 Shaquille Sunflower
 I see my brother Roc(k) in ya windows
 Aye bro look, so many pistols in our crib I'm like, "Which one is mine."
I grab the .40 with the ladder-
 Bro...that gun is mine
See, this one is signed
 Oh, I see the arm engraved (in graves)
 Like zombies when they come alive
 My nigga, who wanna die? I'll leave ya whole block wet
  these pumps burst in the street like summertime

 Knock him out wit' the Iron

 Aye, I pop up where the Da Don and them chillin'
Bombard where they livin'
 Palmin' the Smith &, revolvers is spinnin'
 .357 as soon as Lux (lucks) ran out
 The odds was against him
 I had to make Chess a part of this mission
In the Cave we role players, ain't no choosin' sides
It was killin' me myself pushin' Tsu aside (suicide)
We was back and forth on that line like suicides
He told me I needed a goon to ride so he told me, "Call Chess."
 I'm only here to do a job
They put a young dawg (dog) down
 And now what?
 You gotta look the youth in eyes (euthanize)
 SWAT team, let me show you how we do a crime
...on the radar
 Spotted him on his radar, soon as you arrive
 I pull like, "...Nigel?" I slide wit' them Uber vibes
 Body suit, mask tape, way I look like I scuba dive
 Tuxedo, Donald Trump mask, this my new disguise
 Wait, wait, on queue, I watch the front while you move inside
Aye, go around back
 They left it unsupervised
 How many rooms you spot?
 'Bout 2 to 5
 Who in the first?
 They home schoolin' a son, I give the tutor five
 Then what?
 The kid ran out to loud buses (busts)
 Transportation for school arrived
I kick in the next door
 Calicoe and Mook inside?
 Hit Mook wit' a cal' then Murda land (Murdaland) on him
 That's how that group collide
 I kick in the next door
 That's Suge and Jeruz inside
 Give Newz some, then Jimmy Newsome died
 A Muslim in Jerusalem?
 I don't care who ya guy
 They both gettin' crucified
 Next door?
 Nah, nah, it's straight through the wall like the coochie wide
 Flash grenade, lookin' through the smoke to see who survived
 BANG!
 BANG!

 Target neutralized
 Big Eagle, this D.E. Lux (deluxe)
 Super size
 He think he Cochise in The Warriors
 'Til he Cochise in Cooley High
 You gon' beat us? Still niggas lyin'
 This Chess not "Baby Surf", I don't steal niggas lines
 Long nose, rubber grip
 That's how the steel was designed
 I made that watch that Smack call "real nigga time"
Light bars! Gang shit!

 Where Surf at? Surf you wanna come out now or nah? Okay we'll wait. We'll wait
 We'll wait. We'll wait
 I said, last round we dumbed it down
 Yeah we did
 Y'all want that or complexity?
 C'mon talk about it
 Cause on paper I got the best pens next to me
 And if my bul (ball) points we gon' ride (write) out
 Facts (fax), he's a machine
 Just send mine like telepath-
Just send mind like telepath-
{Lux starts hitting the side of his head}
Just send mine like telepath-
 Wait, wait, wait. This wasn't supposed to happen. Wait, wait wait
Another one? Another one? Khaled voice
Luckily on the side I got an extra key
But the battery's not included
{Lux turns into Robo Lux}
 An-an-and the energy's sold separately
Back reconnected we
Two leaders (liters) at high altitude
 So the (soda) pop different
 That's what bein' in the Mountain do (Dew)
Kill switch, I'm 'bout to control everything about the room
G-g-got my partner and in his bag
Even Nu Jerzey Twork bouncin' too
{Twork starts bouncing. Crowd goes crazy}
 L-L-Look at him, e-e-e-emotional
Don't be mad, they minds ain't Wizards like ours (Oz)
Shit, only thing I'm missin' the wand
This makes it more official my guy got stripes, that's point man
Hollow's whistlin' by
{Hollow goes past Roc and Chess blowing a referee whistle}
 Bro, I must say, we are up here snappin'
Look, you might wanna grab a flick
 Alright, cool but, my nigga, are you gonna let me rap again?
 You gonna make sure they get the picture?
 Shit, I've been waitin' for you to tag me in
 How you wanna caption this?
 Make it a Gun Title since they gassin' 'em
 No, no, no that's some shit
That ain't the crowd bro
Chess gave me some Cake earlier, I ate that shit by accident
 I got that same gut feeling
 Well whatchu mean?
 That these gas tricks (gastric) won't by a pass (bypass) for them
 That was surgical too
 They pumpin' on Chess (chest)
 Fools servicin' you
 Roc get gas
 That's emergency fume
 Aye! Aye! Let me get 30 on 2
 Oooh, this what we do
{Lux stumbles. Hollow does a mic check, some dude comes out and yells at the crowd to not tape the battle. The crowd yells back no one's taping. Crowd starts yelling "Choke!"}
 I said fuck that, let me get back to the headpiece
 But Surf ain't battlin' you can't reach
 Well shit, now you got me stretchin' like Zangief
Fuck that! Plan B
I'll dust off Roc and open Chess (chest) like an antique
 This where it actually can be
You're most impressive
So effective
Throat projectin', note select-
Hollow, when the last time you did a...
 Roastin' session?
 Tay Roc listen here
I ain't got a K or Glock, but I do got Tay Roc's biggest fear
It got the beam on it
 The diamond tester!
 Look, y'all niggas talkin' a lot of shit, say I lost, that's kinda bold (bald)
But I'm still here (hair)
So if the God did take an L I just turned it to gold
I said Roc(k) I got somethin' big but it's kinda bolder (boulder)
Once they run outta gas, I got somethin' to pull up on the shoulder
Chess, you must have a connect from the west
 Yes
 I don't know he's smokin'
But it must be some fire ass weed cause
 You just keep chokin'!
God Titles nigga

 I said I'll blast rounds, stomach shot
He-he-he-he lookin' like his last round
 Let's go! Let's go! I didn't even know you was gonna do that you fool! Let's go!
 First and foremost, bring up anything that's past tense
 You're suckin' mad dick
 I got three words only, I'm back bitch!
They say the Cave made me even crazier
 Bat shit
 Big ass MAC clips
 They are the one that I'll air it on
He won't be here for long
 Pass me the pro for this Wess- so this 'bout to get relaced
 Shit race from long distance like a marathon
 Farrakhan starin' wrong
 Suffocate him
 Bag over his head
 That's an airplane carry on
 He a Giant? Bat over his head
 Barry Bonds
 With this cal', his face on a carton
 Dairy farms
 Cut his limbs, I'll send it to his aunt and his moms
 How you gon' send it?
 UPS, how you gon' send it?
 Amazon
 I'm a demon and a god, I make Hell look so heavenly
Treat his body like his energy
 Sold (soul) separately
 Plan A
 I run in his crib with the pole next to me
His bitch pregnant?
 Plan B, no pregnancy
Sick shit
 I'll let it peel (pill) over the counter
 Then the lemon squeeze, hit his tee (tea) like home remedies
 No memory
 Knock everything in his head out
 Mechanical pencil
 I get ticked off and draw lead out
 Aye, he couldn't make it to Queens
 That nigga bled out
 They had to haul him to that Harlem hospital givin' beds out
 Aye, whatchu gonna do?
 I'll run up, "Whatchu said?" and BAOW
 Nah bro, gun in his mouth
 Have him beggin' now?
 Yeah, Lux's chokin' on a Calicoe
 Let me get it together now
Roc! Roc!
 What's up bro?
 Treat these niggas like laundry clothes
 I put a bunch of rounds in this machine and start washin' Load's
 If he iron press him with heat and watch him start to fold
 I'll knock a nugget out of his mind
 Ooh, that bar was gold
 Red beam, scan on him
 Ooh, that bar was cold (code)
 Can't move, make him sick to his stomach
 That bar was old
 Lick a (liquor) shot, shut him down
 Ooh, that bar was closed
Cakes involved
 The Cave's involved
 Do him greasy
 Don (Dawn) a scrub, watch his plate get washed
 I'm in that fuckin' mode
 Kick in his door
 Gun explode
 Thought it was for him
 I pointed at mother load
 Chess give that bitch the mother load
I'm thinkin' of sonnin' stove
 Oven closed
 Bake him like butter rolls
 Razor sharp, I'll cut it close
 Have his skin hangin' off the bone like
 Grandmother clothes
 Headshot, then the eyes on the Don's rose
 After that the spirit of Da Don arose
 I show up to the funeral bringin' Mama Da Don a rose
 This body gonna be perfect like
 Under Madonna robes
 Tryin' to tell him that this ain't what they want from me
 These niggas was on Brokeback Mountain, that shit is sus' to me
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 Fuck Loaded Hollows
 That shit about a gun to me
 Loaded hollows the only thing that get the job done for me
Gang shit!

 Fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
 Fresh out nigga, ain't nothin' to go back!
 For Surf it was lookin' rocky
 Trump must've tweeted for that nigga
 Yeah cause he got out ASAP
 Nigga say that!
We couldn't make this shit up to stay alive
 What's that?
 Last year the nigga get shot up on 7/25
 Wild, wild, cause this year the nigga get locked up on 7/25
 Well what'd he go in for?
 Like, six Glocks and seven .25's
 And he always go in like 6 o'clock and get out 'bout
 7:25!
 But didn't he name his album Seven 25?
 Wow that's crazy
Cause I heard he sold that album to his fans...
 You lyin'!
 For $7.25
 But we can't make this shit up to stay alive
Roc what's up?
 What's up Roc?
 I know you niggas get points for goin' to jail but...
Surf you about a misdemeanor away from just lookin' like a fuck up
Man, you niggas out here just cuttin' up
 But the problem is Roc he sell fights, we make movies, that's true greatness
 Harvey Dent wit' the promotion
 Y'all don't know who y'all Two Face'd wit'
 See jokes is what what you make it
 Then you take it
 You took a reel
 From the real
 And then bootlegged it??
 Nigga Roc switched cliques every week, ain't no tellin' who Tay wit'
 Facts
 But since he poked his chest (Chess) out, I'ma let you Cave it
 Indiana Jones had a cross wit'-
{Hollow says he wants to bring it back and do something different}
 But the problem is Roc he sell fights, we make movies, that's true greatness
 Harvey Dent wit' the promotion
 Y'all don't know who y'all Two Face'd wit'
 See jokes is what what you make it

 Nigga we don't Volumes, only huge stages
The views crazy-
 Talk dirty! Keep go-
{Hollow is now mouthing the lines but not speaking out loud}
...nigga what is you sayin' bruh?
 We evolved the game that's a mute-tation
{Hollow now switches back to the original rhymes}
 Ain't no tellin' who Tay wit'
 That's a fact
 And since he poked his chest (Chess) out, I'ma let you Cave it
 Like Indiana Jones had a talk wit' Laura Croft about tomb raidin'
Nigga, I'm goin' in
Mood swingin' a bat
 And he wit' the bat?
 That mean we got all night to catch you sleepin' while you hangin'
 Waaait, wait, wait, this a new game now
 Yeah it's a new game now
 Well these niggas is too basic like shoe laces in new ASICS, mixed wit' a blue/grey suede kick
 Keep go- keep goin'!
 They go wit' this hoodie, I think was dope
But fire grey hoodie I-
 Bro, you wit' this play play shit, right now bro
I'm a grown ass man, nigga I told you, I fathered this whole scene man
{Hollow sits down on the stage with a Styrofoam cup in his hand}
I'm a King; James, wit' fo' rings
And he ain't even got fo' rings man
Since a youth like Lebron was, my Juice been like Jamba
I came in the market a pro-teen (protein)
That was so mean
Bro what the fuck is you doin'? That bet' not be no codeine nigga
 Shit, I'm sittin' down, you said "stand up niggas don't lean"
 Bro I partnered witchu. Bro you embarrassing us, you OD'ing nigga
You up here lookin' like a dope fiend
 Hold on, who the fuck is you callin' a "dope fiend"?
 You nigga. You embarrassing us nigga
 Fuck that we can rematch our battle and redo the whole thing
 Well let's go then
 Let's go nigga
{Chess jumps into the crowd to watch Lux and Hollow rematch}
 Up here promotin' the throatin' nigga
You gettin' loaded, reloaded, I'll open ya moments I noticed it loaded when you opened and closed it, nigga
 Okay, okay, that was aight, that was fuckin' cool but
The data for this new match, I just ain't runnin' to it
It just don't look the same now that I'm back up in front of you
 So this what you really wanna do?
 This what I wanna do
 What in the world is this shit coming to?
Yo, I'ma connect if you punch out
I'm in the middle man, but right now like Dapper Dan with the suit somehow
You thought it was Gucci, bringing out Black Face
To bad we in the world where only the blue one's count, nigga
 Okay, okay, so that's what you say my friend?
 That's what I say my friend
 So that's your statement then?
 You heard me bro
 How 'bout you say it to Black Face....AGAIN
{Black Face comes out of the crowd and stands in front of Lux}
 You nigga on ya play play, y'all don't even know who y'all playin' wit'
You niggas don't even know who you playin' wit'
{Loaded Lux breaks out the grey hoodie. Crowd goes nuts.}
 Hollow!
 What?
 What?! You sure you want some of this, nigga?
 Look, my name Bennett and I ain't in it, nigga
{Hollow walks off the stage}
 I feel like I got that .38 wit' the electric tape
Bangin' like an 808
Base (bass) with me if you want, punk
I'll knock ya chest (Chess) in, Zepplin with the lead (Led) Roc(k)
Headshot, can he dig it?
You niggas done made grave mistakes
Save ya faith
There once was a man preachin'
Then in his head, ICE said "Wolf, they want you in The Grey like Liam Neeson"
The fans need it
They want the wild child, the come to chow hungry, growls
Punches every rounds, kickin' it
Back then for no chicken
But you was still gettin' kung POW (Pao) nigga
Off top, cuttin' up like Kung Lao
You want the underground?
You want the young Black Star or seven minute freestyle no money down?
I mean I'm just stretchin'
Do you want the bow flexin' or the runnin' Miles?
I'll work it out
What? He dig that
Handgun, where my prints went
Carlton Banks was still at Princeton
When the Gun Bar King was oooowwh, still a prince then
Now you fenced in, pipe on me...not like where the sink went
Hole in (holding) the Desert like quicksand, now let that sink in
What they think?
{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}
Whatchu thinkin' I got memory loss?
Did these primitive thought, limited energy source niggas forget what they talk?
You said, "Loaded Hollows wouldn't be in sync."
Well gangsta you was right, cause we still got to send a G (synergy) off
Ayo Hollow!
 Yo
 You don't want none of this? Nigga is you sure?
 Nigga I'm takin' a sip at the bar
 If you don't put that goddamn drink down and get out here and finish him off
{Hollow comes back out}
 After you did all that, I already thought these niggas was lost
