On the backroads
And we can crank up that radio
Just bring an ice chest full of beer
Ain’t nothin’ but hay fields out here
And everything’s gonna be all right
The dance floor’s made of dirt tonight
On the backroads
Yeah back on the backroads

When you get close, you better drive slow
Cause this old road’s full of potholes
Just flip your brights a couple times
So we all know you ain’t the PoPo
Yeah we’re all here on country time
Tearin’ it up under cargo lights
We might stay here all night
Wake up to that morning sunrise

And baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night

Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No telling when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
A couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, cause

I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance 

I was just drunk, dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might have said a little too much
You know I don't think before I talk when I got a good buzz
Can't be held responsible for what I was saying
You know I say a lot of things when I've been drinking

Yeah, and I was drinking

Can't believe what I said
But at least I made you laugh
After all this time since we said goodbye
I'm glad I can still do that

Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know
