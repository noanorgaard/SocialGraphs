From the office the sunlight frames your silhouette
I think of lighting fireworks, I think of pirouettes
I idly write down observations on the scene
Like do the blueprints name the rooms alone?
Do we name them on our own?
We hardly live in there

You with a book propped on your knees
A breeze seen in your coffee steam
I’m in the office thinking back to rules of poetry
Like, it’s fourteen lines, the last two rhyme
What does pentameter mean?

You in the living room
Legs bent at forty-five degrees
I write AB AB, try to find your rhyme scheme
I look for objects on the desk with which to sculpt your image best
What would I name this? Could I paint it “Woman (reading)?” “Girl (at rest)?”

I remember it so well watching you shifting your weight, turning the page, I can see it all there
Inside a living room where only I live and never go in

Do those moments replay for you?
When I’m suddenly there and then won’t go away
When you’re sitting in the living room reading for the afternoon
Do you put your book down look and try to find me there?
Sometimes I think of all the people who lived here before us
How the spaces in the memories you make
Change your room from just blueprints to the place where you live

When you leave here
When you go from a home
You take all that you own
But the memories echo
On hardwood floor in the living room
Tore the carpet, the scratches below that we found
And the wine stain on the couch
We got drunk and decided we’d still try to move it around
And I can’t tell what the difference is between the ones that we made and the ones that we didn’t make
They all conjure images still
Where you sit and you read in the sunlight aware that I watch
And I live alone now
Save for the echoes
I live alone now
Save for the
