Hold on, hold on, we've got the lights dear
Just like where you came from
Hold on, hold on, we've got the lights dear
Just like where you're going to

Hold on, I feel like you could shine a little brighter my love
Just like you did when you were younger
Underneath the copper wires and the floorboards that creak
I hope they never end

I was wishing we could go back to how it was
Before our age impaired our speech
I was wishing we could go back to the house
Our hands pressed in the concrete

Hold on, hold on, we've got the lights dear
Just like where you came from
Hold on, hold on, we've got the lights dear
Just like where you're going to
You might also like
Hold on, I feel like you could shine a little brighter my love
Just like you did when you were younger
Underneath the copper wires and the floorboards that creak
I hope they never end

Hold on, I feel like you could shine a little brighter my love
Just like you did when you were younger
Underneath the copper wires and the floorboards that creaks
I hope they never end

Hold on, I feel like you're a little bit too far away
And I remember the beginning, how it was
With your hands on my shoulders, oh my
I hope it never ends
Hold on, I feel like you're a little bit too far away
And i remember the beginning, how it was
With your hands on my shoulders, oh my
I hope it never
