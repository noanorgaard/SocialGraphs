In a land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I grow, I shall fight
For this land, I shall die
Let her sun never set

They say one day you run outta lyrics to write
But even right now I'm trying so hard not to bite
The legends who paved the way
For me
To run up on the stage and spit rhymes for a couple of peeps
Will I take a big l or end up like a big l
My ambition is to be legendary
I learnt that shit from Mr whale
It's wale nigga ain't you Nigerian
I just be playing nigga
I'm a comedian
Thinking bout how biggie died in 97
Eleven months later your boy stepped up out of heaven
Am I a reincarnate
Probably not
But am I a hot spitter
It's just something you got
And no one can take away
Until you land in your grave
The way you laying all these verses
Just to make em replay
I mean
Of course I'm chasing cheddar
But just to make it good
I'm doing what I love
Michelle could make it better

All this school shit got me half stepping
I know that I'm a genius but I'm visibly stressing
Fuck it these niggas lessons isn't really connecting
With the boy from the kogi whose struggling with adolesceence
But I give it my all
In the hope that I won't fall
But still some on my dawgs
Mehn I just look at them in awe
Cos really they ain't struggling
And yet they just be bundling A's like it was maize on the floor for the taking
That's an opinion right
Well maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I should take some time and write out my wrongs
Maybe I should go and study instead of writing this-
But I don't got time for thinking bout past times
Only thing that's on my mind is lyrics and punchlines
But as hot as I can be
I'm still chasing a degree
Lord willing imma make it before I turn 23
Cos I'm tired of these shackles
A Nigga just wanna be free

Women
That's a topic never understood
Does she like me does she not
Carrie Underwood
Cos I'm blown away
Even by words she says
In fact so blown away
That I forgot to ask her name
Oh I see her again
But she's replaying in my brain
And when the time comes the only thing I hear is shame
There's never a right time to approach the one you love
I got advice for many days but all those things I've never done
See The kinks and I somehow
Met the same chick
I'm tryna take her to the sanctuary really really quick
But when I think about it the emphasis really shifts
If the feeling ain't mutual it's time for me to skip
I think I learned that shit the hard way
But that's for another rhyme day

I'm evolving to a prime Jay
Hopefully I'll find bey along the fucking way

She sings along with all the saddest songs
And she believes the stories are real
She lets the music dictate the way that she feels

It's only jukebox music
Only jukebox music
It's only music
Only jukebox music
Only jukebox music

Seems to me she's in a fantasy
She's livin' in a world of her own
And we all agree that she's a mystery
Because she'd rather be all alone
Every guy will do his best to try
To put that music out of her head
Forget all the songs
And just dance to the music instead

Different friends and a new set of clothes

Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep
Get back, get back

I did my knees bend, press ups, touch my toes
I had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed

Surely there must be a way

Dissatisfied is what I am
I want to be a better man

1 ContributorCelluloid Heroes (live) LyricsEverybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are
There are stars in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete
Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain
Rudolph Valentino
Looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life
You might also likeIf you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn 'round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain
Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in show-biz
It doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard
I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
'Cause celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die
You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Oh, celluloid heroes never really die

Catch a ride
We on the vibe train
And it don't rain
Wherever I stay
Happieness
Gotta maintain
Hard to mantain
Gotta maintain

Gotta maintain (gotta)
Exercise, cycling with strava
Java, daily, wake me up
Relationship with myself, prenup
Focused on my goals, habitually
Committed to being happy, persistently
Striving for connection, spiritually
Good days and bad days, predictably
Now I'm not the one that's always falling, down
But if do, I arise with my crown
I was born different
Imma different breed
Answer to nobody but Him
Respect my Creed
Not the realest yet but I'm working toward

From every single direction
People preaching their own section
Living there lives
Thinking that they're always right
Who do you think you are
Aiming to Mars
Yet your smashing into bars
It’s driving me crazy
Making me lazy
I’m focusing on your negativity
It’s corrupting slash manipulating my own reality
Does it even matter if I’m right or wrong
Ai
Does it actually change my life’s song
Then the self hate kicks in
Boom boom
To ma head
You put me through darkness to give me light
Even when I say you're wrong, I know you're right
You've always been there for me, day or night
Catch me when I'm falling, say it'll be alright
It'll be alright
But will it though? Honestly
Have to live it through, tales of the Odyssey

Catch a ride
We on the vibe train
And it don't rain

Just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun

Everybody say I'm lazy
They all tell me, "Get a job you slob"
I'd rather be a hobo walking 'round with nothing
Than a rich man scared of losing all he's got

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun
Why should I have to give my reasons?
For sitting in the midday sun

Oh, look at all the ladies
Looking their best in their summer dresses
Oh, sitting in the sun
I've got no home, I've got no money
But who needs a job when it's sunny? Woah, woah

I haven't got a steady occupation
And I can't afford a telephone
And I haven't got a stereo, radio or video

The only way that I can get my fun

With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun

Oh, listen to the people who
Say I'm a failure and I've got nothing
Ah, but if they would only see
I've got my pride, I've got no money
But who needs a job when it's sunny? Woah, woah

Everybody thinks I'm crazy
And everybody says I'm dumb
But when I see the people shouting at each other
I'd rather be an out of work bum

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun
With no particular purpose or reason
I'm sitting in the midday

Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?
It's only natural

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she'd always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on, sister, have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural
Come dancing
Just like the Palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to 

This time tomorrow, where will we be?
On a spaceship somewhere
Sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow, what will we know?
Will we still be here
Watching an in-flight movie show?

I'll leave the sun behind me
And I'll watch the clouds
As they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me
I can see the world
And it ain't so big at all

Oh, this time tomorrow
What will we see?
Fields full of houses
Endless rows of crowded streets

I don't know where I'm going
I don't want to see
I feel the world below me
Looking up (Looking up, looking up)
Looking up at me

Leave the sun behind me
And I'll watch the clouds
As they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion
And the world below
Doesn't matter much to me

Well, this time tomorrow, where will we be?
On a spaceship somewhere
Sailing across an empty sea

Well, this time tomorrow, where will we be?
This time tomorrow, what will we see?
This time tomorrow


Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told thе truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mommy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Whеre have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?

It's your life

Tired of waiting for you
