'Cause He's a great God
You are a great God

Praise the Lord O my soul
And let all that's within me praise His name
I will not die I will live
And I will tell of the works of the Lord
And sing of His wonders
I will not die I will live
I will not die I will live

'Cause he's a great God
You are a great God

Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
Through it all, through it all
It is well
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
It is well with me

Far be it from me to not believe
Even when my eyes can't see
And this mountain that's in front of me
Will be thrown into the midst of the sea

Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
Through it all, through it all
It is well

The waves and wind still know His name

It is well with my soul (3x)
It is well it is well with my soul (3x)
Ahhhhhhh

Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You Lord
Through it 

Hope is alive today
'Cause He is alive today
The stone was rolled away
Death defeated in His grave
Hope is alive today
I can see He is alive today
No matter what we face
We overcome in Jesus name

He was buried on that day
In tombs where Heroes are forgotten
The earth realized it could not hold Him
And this was more than just a man

Hope is alive today
He is alive today
The stone was rolled away
Death defeated in His grave
Our hope is alive today
He is alive today
No matter what we face
We overcome in Jesus name
Our hope is alive
He is alive today

Eternal life You gave us
Your great revenge upon all darkness
Through the sacred Blood of Jesus
We've become Your righteousness
I can hear the angels
Joining in our anthem
Oh with all the hosts of heaven
We shout the victory is won
Oh the victory is won

Our hope is alive today
He is alive today
The stone was rolled away
Death defeated in His grave
Our hope is alive today
'Cause He is alive today
No matter what we face
We overcome in Jesus name
Our hope is alive today
He is alive, He's alive, He's alive
He's alive
