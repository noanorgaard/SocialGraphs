Spread it thin
Make it bend
Help me save him, make the ends
I got things to feed, to reimburse
And he’s sick, I’m alone and it’s getting worse
You might also like“Today, today” you say, it’s useless
Just a couple figures for the different uses
Here it comes the sum of all excuses
Where did you think I got these 

Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

I will surely wake it
Bright lights turn me green

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate
We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?
As you shiver, count up all your mistakes
Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

Made with adrenaline
Seeping out through the skin
Like only lovers could
Here's where we begin
Time is the medicine
To heal these needs that only raise our voices

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

But we can separate
To form these hearts in stone
Rewrite this pain we own
Caught here in the wake
Nothing but genuine
Built on a skeleton
Of fractured parts
That only raise our voices

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

Better believe the sea of changes
And put these battered bones to rest
Nothing invisible or nameless
Leave no reason to confess (confess)
