Early morning we get it
Working at sunrise
My dreams are not own
I see it through Gods eyes
Which implies
Legacy's much greater than I
It's ashamed people's dreams are killed the day they die
Paralyzed by doubt, fear they can't escape/
Living behind a mask
Drowning in self hate
As the wind blows
And the leaves wither
Today is a new day
Gods painting a better picture

These moments are what dreams are made of
Keep my head to sky
They can't break us
So Watch how far we go
No limits
Nothing impossible (2x)

When Times get tough
Just push a little harder
Rise above the odds
Faith a take ya father
Steps are being ordered
By the ultimate orchestrater
Tough times don't last
They only gone make you greater
We don't quit
We persevere
Hold ya head high
No limits at all
Reach for the sky
Shine bright through the night
Make ya life count
Got hope so great 
That it shatters doubt

These moments are what dreams are made of
Keep my head to sky
They can't break us
So Watch how far we go
No limits
Nothing impossible (
