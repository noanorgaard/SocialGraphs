Oh, the hero comes
I can hear the drums
And our horses run to the kingdom come
Through the pale moonlight
Our hearts ignite to the call
Oh, claim your prize
For a crown of stars
In the name of love
Be the sacrifice
You and I will stand and fight
Our backs to the wall

Oh hero, hero
Hero, hero
Hero, hero
I wanna be a hero, hero

You might also like
There is no escape
Let the fever rise
As our horses rage
And our goal's in sight
Maybe I'm the one, I'm the one who will fall
Oh, lay me down
On a bed of stone
I will wait for you
As I rest my soul
I will watch you ride
When you reply to the call

Oh hero, hero
Hero, hero
Hero, hero
I want to be a hero, hero


Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes
Don't be scared, shut your eyes
Watch those lights
From the stars
In your head, hypnotized
Join our fight for what's right
Let your heart be your guide
Ой герой, герой ты мой
Да зовет герой меня в бой
Ой герой, ты герой ты мой
Ты возьми подругу с собой
