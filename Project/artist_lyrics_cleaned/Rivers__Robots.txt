Of the name above all other names
He’s our victory
He’s our joy and prize
He’s the reason we lay down our livesYou might also

Lord of the mountains and sea
You are treading a path set for me
God of the seasons and sky
You have always been holding my life

And let You take control of this surrendered life

So I put my trust in the one

In shaking You remain
Unmoved and unafraid
Forever and always

Lead me through the valleys
Lead me in Your wisdom

And clothed me in His righteousness

The King of Love has set me free
He’s taken off my filthy rags
And brought me in the familyYou might also
