And when you're free, take a walk
Around the building that you drew
And steal the person from a story
That you think no one's heard of
What happened here, oh did you feel
Don't think you knew how much you were
Just 'cause heads aren't perfect circles
And they slept while you woke
Wouldn't you like what happened here
As if you lost something you love
Look at pictures of the moonlight
Try to pick out a favorite
But did you know, like all the rest
We keep our memories in a safe
And all the inside is full of writing
Like a ticket you saved
You might also like
