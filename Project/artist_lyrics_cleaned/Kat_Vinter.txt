Shapes, stayed where it constellations
Let me go with the tide
We're like islands, drifting apart in different directions
We're like islands, loosing sight of each other's reflections
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Days, have to end eventually
Change, is a friend don't you see?
Last night, hold on to the tide
We're like islands, drifting apart in different directions
We're like islands, loosing sight of each other's reflections
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Who knows, who knows if we'll ever come back to where we began
Who knows, who knows if we'll ever come back to where we began
We're like islands, drifing apart in differnt directions
We're like islands, loosing sight of each other's reflections
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Yeah, we'll go where the current takes us
Yeah, we're going where the current takes us
Yeah, we're going where the current takes usYou might also
