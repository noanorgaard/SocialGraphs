Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, oh-oh

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots

It's time to ramble on

Our only goal will be the western shore

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake (Watch out)
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it's startin' to flow
I think I might be sinkin'
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there
Where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, "La la la la"
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Tellin' myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems (Mm, ah)

Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last, the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

The woe of aftermath

Sing as you raise your bow (ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes
Ah

When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

From the deep behind the Sun
Kissed my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh


With blazing eyes, you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
