Just like in fiction, in every addiction (Oh, oh)
Oh, fantasy's taking over, awake me

I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way

Broken me and broken them, and
You are broken too
Open ears, their eyes are open
Makes me call for you (Oh, oh)

But there's no seduction, only destruction (Oh, oh)
Oh, fantasy, take me over and break me

But I feel ali-li-live (Hmm)

I feel 

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
You're half the world away

And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I can leave this spirit
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
You're half the world away
