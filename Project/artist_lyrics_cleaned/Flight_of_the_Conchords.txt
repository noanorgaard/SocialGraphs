Going to the party
Sippin' on Bacardi
Wanna meet a hottie
But there's Adam, Steve and Marty
There's Billy, Todd and Tommy
They're on leave from the army
The only boobs I'll see tonight will be made of origami
Tell the fellas make it understood
It ain't no good if there's too much wood
Make sure you know before you go
The dance floor bro-ho ratio
5 to 1, it's a "brodeo"
Tell Steve and Mark its time to go
Wait outside all night to find
Twenty dudes in a conga line

Too many dicks on the dance floor, easy to fix
Too many dicks on the dance floor, spread out the dicks
You might also like
Too many dudes with too many dicks
Too close to my shit, too hard to meet chicks
I need better odds, more broads less rods
I came to do battle, skedaddle with the cattle prods
Too many men, too many boys
Too many misters not enough sisters
Too much time on too many hands
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Not enough ladies, too many mans
Too many mans, too many mans

Too many dicks on the dance floor
Too many dicks on the dance floor (Too many dicks!)
Too many dicks on the dance floor (Too many dicks!)
Too many dicks on the dance floor

Too many dicks, too many dongs
Too many schlongs, now sing this song
Too many dicks on the- Too many dicks on the-
Dicks on the- Dicks on the-
Dicks- Dicks- Dance- Dicks-
Di- Di- Di- Di- Dicks on the dance floor
Too many dicks on the dance floor
Too many dicks on the dance floor (Too many dicks!)
Too many dicks on the dance floor (Too many dicks!)
Too many dicks on the dance
