I've been waiting all of my life for you
I've been wishing on every shining star
I've been watching out of my window

Wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
I'm wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
I'm wondering where you are
Wondering where you
