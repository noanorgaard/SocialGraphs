'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that bass!
Motherfucker, say what?

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucka dead, L.A. Times front page

Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my '6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?
Rock this motherfucker like Three the Hard Way

I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my '6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said "Oh, brother."
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit
L.A. playa
Big Drum Beater

I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
"Disruption of the court," said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "Fire!", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Get busy, y'all!
Aw
You 

Well, I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches, but I got much more
Wit my super-duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, motherfuckers, cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard dopeman, you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 Ball sippin', the bitches are flippin'
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my trippin'
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make, so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbin' my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roamin' the streets
And wit' a homie like Dre just supplyin' the beats
You might also like
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

("I was") ("knocking motherfuckers out")
("What's your name, boy?")
("Funky, fresh Eazy-E")
("Kick, kick that shit")
("Where you from, fool?") ("Compton") ("Yeah!")

Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say, "What's up"
To the niggas on the corner cold bumpin' the box
But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks
A dice game starts, I said, "What the fuck?"
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit' my bitch jockin' 24-7
Rolled them motherfuckers, ate 'em up, hit 11 (Rock that shit, homie)
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was takin' niggas money and was itchin' for mo'
Laughing in they face and said, "Y'all making me rich"
'Til one punk got jealous, cold slapped my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, "Homeboy, you better think fast"
He shot (*pow, pow*), then I shot (*gunshots*)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (Haha)
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it
Motherfuckin' Eazy does it
(But how does he do it)
"Eazy duz it, do it eazy, that's what I'm doing"
("Stop!") (Man, what you gonna do now?)

Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker motherfucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house, car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must've been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah, I went to jail, but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter to 9
Called my bitch to get me out, 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip, cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone
All the shit I did for her, like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well, by now you can guess that it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said, "What's up?"
And said, "Let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up"
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit' my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell and cold smoked the ho
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

From around the way, born in '73
Hardcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and a hundred percent street
And if you all wanna hear some more...
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the 

Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no business, so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin' real G's
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition "Original baby gangsta"
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya with my fuckin' shank if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin' G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre (What's up?)

I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like bootcamp
Got to follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin' G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre (What's up?) *Bang*
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre (What's up?)

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
