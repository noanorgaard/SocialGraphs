It ain't no trick to get rich quick

If you dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick

In a mine (In a mine)

In a mine (In a mine)

Where a million diamonds (Shine)
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig from early morn' 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight

We dig up diamonds by the score

A thousand rubies, sometimes more
You might also like
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for

We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig
