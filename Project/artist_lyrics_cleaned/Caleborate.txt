Man you know they scared to play us
Might Beyonce Lemonade 'em
Cooking so much sauce, had your girl come clean my apron
Life been tasting better than my mama's jamabaliyah
Still a New Orleans nigga, don't try us, I got fam in San Fran
Know I got the Bay with me, get action like Van Damme
Know I got some baes with me, yeah
Jeans got skinny when the dreams got plenty
So I let my feelings pour and mix the bitter taste with Henny
Then I'm gone

Real real spill like living in the ghetto
Real ass nigga, them boys sons of Geppetto
I grabbed all the girls that said they don't like short guys
Now they say they was wrong on every single level
Lookie man, I make my profits then I let them shine
I mean a prophet don't need profits so I give back mine
I don't usually want to trip but I might this time
Cause I just gotta know why they always on my line
You might also like
We rollin', they can't stop us
No molly, but we popping
They want it but we got it
I been getting to it like there ain't no option
We rollin', they can't stop us
No molly, but we popping
They want it but we got it
I been getting to it like there ain't no option

Now all you gotta do is tell me what's really going on
City running rabid ever since you left from home
That's way too many options that I wish I could condone
Went from desolate to blowing up my phone
I been grinding like my whole life, can tell it by my palms
Mama texting bible scriptures, man she love them psalms
Papa just got out of rehab, know a place before your arms
I hope you know a nigga never meant no harm
Cause nowadays it's yourself you should be focused on
Can't love nobody if you don't love you, that  strong
I spent some days losing dignity, hoping I was wrong
Come and go, come and go
No squad, I done had a ton of those nigga, I'm a loner
North Dade ain't raised no bungalow
Still everybody played juice at the two stop
All eyes on me, no
Niggas still tryna play me like a tube box
Freaking for the free, but you only get two shots
North Dade be the city when I rep that
Sak pase to the zoes when I catch that
Used to wanna work around the money, nigga always doin' favors
Had to boss up bro, where the checks at?
Yeah we rolling, no stop and go
Nigga had to call my pops to let him know his son about to blow
Came a long way from the free lunch, now we be us just to get some dough
No more piecing up for my liquor, I'ma get my own
And now you see the hardest thing is staying true
To yourself
Oh you know, still ain't had to sell my soul for some wealth
Oh hell no, that's not me
Lost in my thoughts is where I be
I got a few options for the girls in my world but they can't see what I see
Snuck in the club with no ID
Game in the blood, nigga no IV
Know I gotta move, real sharp in the room from the sharks, they got their eye on me
Now nigga all my life been setbacks
Ain't gon' give in or accept that
I got options like Cam Newton or Steph Curry with the stepback

We rollin', they can't stop us
No molly, but we popping
They want it but we got it
I been getting to it like there ain't no option
We rollin', they can't stop us
No molly, but we popping
They want it but we got it
I been getting to it like there ain't no option
Cause there ain't no other
