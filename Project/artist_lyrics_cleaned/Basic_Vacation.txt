I tried so hard to give it up
But you won't let me, no

You're in my head
You never left
And now I'm just another dumb kid
Who let you get into my head
You never left
And now I'm just another kid wishing that we never even met, no

You're in my head
You never left

Here I am
I'm by your place again
I can't pretend that I'm just wandering
'cuz through the fence
I see another one is walking right into your web
You might also like
I tried so hard to give it up
But you won't let me, no

You're in my head
You never left
And now I'm just another dumb kid
Who let you get into my head
You never left
And now I'm just another kid wishing that we never even met, no

You're in my head
You never left

Oh, let me go
Oh, let me go now
You won't let me go
Won't let me go now
Oh, let me go
Oh, let me go now
You won't let me go
Won't let me go
It's 4 AM
I'm by the phone again
This has to end

You're in my head
You never left
And now I'm just another dumb kid
Who let you get into my head
You never left
And now I'm just another kid wishing that we never even met, no

(You're in my head, you're in my head)
You're in my head
(You're in my head, you're in my head)
Won't let me go,
