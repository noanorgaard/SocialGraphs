Go to hell!
If you're reading this then I'm not here
Take your someone else
And let me make this crystal clear that
That I don't need your help
And I'm okay by myself
You can go to hell!

And they say you tell them everyday
How you can feel the way I feel
How we're connected by the heart
And you're convinced it's something real
Well if that's true, I hope you're smiling
Like I am from ear to ear
And just in case you think I'm lying
I've left a page to make it clear
That now I open up and scream
To the whole world I've finally left
So if you hear me out of breath
I'm singing...

Go to hell!
If you're reading this then I'm not here
Take your someone else
And let me make this crystal clear that
That I don't need your help
And I'm okay by myself
You can go to hell!

I feel it's time that I have said
There are some things I regret
Like never checking out the odds against this bet
'Cause I would bet my favorite things I've ever owned
That you would leave and I'd be missing you like hell
But I won't...
Go to hell!
If you're reading this then I'm not here
Take your someone else
And let me make this crystal clear that
That I don't need your help
And I'm okay by myself
You can go to hell
Yeah, you can, yeah you can, you can...
Go to hell!
If you're reading this then I'm not here
Take your someone else
And let me make this crystal clear that
That I don't need your help
And I'm okay by myself
You can go to hell!

Oh, you can go to hell
You make sure you take someone else!
Oh, and you know you can
Yeah, you can go to 

Cause I’ve been trying way too long
To try and be the perfect song
When our hearts are heavy burdens
We shouldn’t have to bear alone

So goodnight moon and goodnight you
When you’re all that I think about
All that I dream about
How’d I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feelings we sing about
Sit in our bedroom and read aloud
Like a passage from goodnight moon

And sing for me softly love your song for tomorrow
And tell me my name's the one that’s hidden in there somewhere
And dream for me anything
But dream it in color about
We know the suns still rising and we don’t care

Cause I’ve been trying way too long
To try and be the perfect song
When our hearts are heavy burdens
We shouldn’t have to bear alone

So goodnight you, and goodnight moon
When you’re all that I think about
All that I dream about
How’d I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feeling we sing about
Sit in our bedroom and read aloud
Like a passage from goodnight moon
Goodnight moon

And there you were
As I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs
It's hard to miss the way her eyes light up the room and steal the air
Just feel her lips lock on to every breath I take and breath it in
Do you feel us falling? Cause I feel us falling

So goodnight moon and goodnight you
When you’re all that I think about
All that I dream about
How’d I ever breathe without
A goodnight kiss from goodnight you
The kind of hope they all talk about
The kind of feeling we sing about
Sit in our bedroom and read aloud
Like a passage from goodnight moon (whoa)
Oh goodnight moon (whoa-oh-oh)
And there you were
I saw my Juliet come graceful down the stairs
It's hard to miss the way her eyes light up the room
And steal the air

Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling? Cause I can feel us falling
Do you feel us falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, 

And we lost it all just now
To the nights that left you out
So we'll let this go somehow
But you're gonna be proud
(So proud)

And I just needed you to pick me up
Like you did when we were younger
When the lightning and the thunder
Had me clinging to your heart
For someone
To lift me up
When I'm down, when I'm forgotten
You'll forever be my father
And I'll be saving tears in jars for this one

How can I fit all these words
Into such a simple verse
It's the last time that we'll speak
So listen to me please

And I'll be saving tears in jars for this one

Did you know that you're my heart
And it hurts to be apart
And this cut it hurts so deep
So sing me to
