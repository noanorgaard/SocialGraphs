And I should've crashed the car the night I drove alone
Escape from August cold, whoa

And you talk like someone else

I ran away from you, and now something's killing me
You hang me up as a souvenir of what I couldn't be

And I should've crashed the car when I was all alone
Escape from all I know, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Love, my love
Love, my love
My love
Love, my love

Be mine, pull me in two
I will mold myself just for you
The night is vivid for once
Still, I see nothing but yellow love

Love, my love
Love, my love
My love
Love, my love

All I feel is celestial desire
A distant joy is dancing all around me
All I see is yellow in the spring air
How beautifully the color worked itself in
All I feel is celestial desire (Love, my love)
A distant joy is dancing all around me (Love, my love)
