Just dynamic tension

Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual, that's not too abysmal

We don't want to be any worry

Do the snatch, clean, and jerk
He thinks dynamic tension
Must be hard work
Such strenuous living
I just don't understand
When in just seven days

'Cause I've seen, oh, blue skies
Through the tears in my eyes
And I realise
I'm going home
(I'm going home)

Everywhere it's been the same (feeling)
Like I'm outside in the rain (wheeling)
Free, to try and find a game (dealing)
Cards for sorrow, cards for pain
