I've been thinking 'bout life
And I, I, know I fucked up once or twice
But I, I, thought you could've been my wife
I, I, I

I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you till it's right
I'll love you till it's right

I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you till it's right
You might also like
You've been on the ground
And I just can't imagine you're happy now
Eh, oh, oh, oh
The way we got down
I know nobody's lovin' you like I know how
Eh, oh, oh, oh

I've been thinking 'bout life
And I, I, know I fucked up once or twice
But I, I, thought you could've been my wife
I, I, I

I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you till it's right

I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you till it's right

Thinking bout, thinking bout, thinking bout love
Thinking bout, thinking bout, thinking bout love
If you won't find it
It'll be here in this club
Thinking bout, thinking bout, thinking bout love
Thinking bout, thinking bout, thinking bout love
If you won't find it
It'll be here in this club
I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you till it's right

I, I apologize
I never meant to hurt you
I'll love you 'til it's
