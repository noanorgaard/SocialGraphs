I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?

There’s a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with no desire
To take me away, it’s true
It ain’t easy to say goodbye
Darling, please don’t start to cry
'Cause boy, you know I’ve got to go
Oh, and Lord, I wish it wasn’t so
