There's a hole in my soul, can you fill it? Can you fill it?

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
Dig them up, let's finish what we've started
Dig them up, so nothing's left unturned

All of your flaws and all of my flaws, when they have been exhumed
We'll see that we need them to be who we are, without them, we'd be doomed

Fall upon your knees, sing: "This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing: "You've got the power and control"
Don't pin it all on me

Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh, but how were we to know?

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup
About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck
So I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Londi, she went to Junior High with me
I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"

She said, "What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now, he's just smokin' rock now
So for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life"

So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, "Every day, I wake up, hoping to die"

'Cause me and my sister ran away so our daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager, I done an' been through more of that shit you can't even relate to"
