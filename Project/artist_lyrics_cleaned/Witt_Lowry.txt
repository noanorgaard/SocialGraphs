What you hidin' behind that YouTube icon?
Wait until they kill the YouTube icon
Tried to make everyone happier, was I wrong?
People wanna see you fail when you've given your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life been the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I'm sure to take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain, I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themselves
All you hear about is annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help
Look into my eyes and see what they reveal
I'ma be a legend, I promise that for real, yeah
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothin', I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we goin' is up

And I can't wait to go read all your comments
Like, "Mark only, Mark only talks about girls"
You listened to two songs, man, you are too wrong
Here is my nut for you internet squirrels
I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker, won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rock and chillin' with Peyton
I'm waitin' on tables, but waitin' for tables to turn
It's TEAMWITT, motherfucker, 'til death on my urn
Now I'm next to the rest and y'all waitin' your turn
But they want me fail or to crash and to burn, so I
Pour gas on the fire
Motherfuck me? See, your mom is a liar
I'm probably workin' while you go get higher
You lookin' for real, well, see, I'm the supplier
You lookin' for talent, then pray for mitosis, you're hopeless
I'm hopin' you notice, your fan base is fake
And you hope I don't notice you're full of more shit
Than the back of a rodent, go act like you know 'em
Your rappin' is surface, I'm rappin' a poem
A trojan to catch poetry when she blow 'em
I told 'em, we we're gonna get it
Built up a team and a vision and always stick with it
It's funny my style, you bit it
But knowin' how phoney you are, you ain't never admit it
Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon
When I'm leavin' my room, all you rappers are doomed
Witt Lowry, what the fuck you ever heard about me
Keep your bullshit from around me
Two fingers up, you know nothin' about me
And one finger up to a fuck tryna doubt me, 

And I can't lie, it hurt a little when you said you didn't want me
To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me
Every pic I see is you and him, his Twitter tryna taunt me
You think I'd let it go? This is old and exhausting
Some offspring, family, and a house is what I thought about
Sometimes I wonder if he'll get that now
See, we know that you picked a different path, me, I picked a different route
And I can't help but laugh at how this all played out
You're over me now, I'm hoping you found only the best
Remember when we used to rap that Kanye West?
Graduation in rotation 'cause you liked that best
And back then, I didn't want you, now, look, I'm a mess
I open my chest and through me, you can see no spine
My profile pic and lyrics I've been hidin' behind
It looks like you found the love that I was hopin' to find
The only you I love's the one that I create in my mind, and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
Wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doin' right now
You can hear the pain in my sound
Laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
Wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doin' right now
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
Wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doin' right now
You can hear the pain in my sound
Laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
Wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doin' right now

I often wonder if you ever did care
I wonder why in my mind is the only time you ever were there
See, we were friends, but that felt more like pretend, this year
It's awfully clear, the real us is what I fear
The one where we were only friends and I'd act like we dated
And nowadays our conversation is, "Hey, happy belated"
And every song I wrote for you, you know you actually hated
Because you realized that you never felt the same when you played it
You never cared if I made it, that's why I waited, you know me
See, all the love that I've been gettin' through my phone feels phony
I rhyme a couple words together, every girl wanna blow me
We're in a world full of people, yet I'm feeling so lonely
If only I could tell myself there's plenty fish in the sea
But see, the sea is full of sharks, fake guppies, and greed
And as I find myself drownin' while I'm fightin' to breathe
I realize that I'm in love with what I thought we could
