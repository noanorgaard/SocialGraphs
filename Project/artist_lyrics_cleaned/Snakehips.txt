Oh no, the pennies dropped
How did my focus stop?
I never let desire lead me blind
(I can’t get enough)
Oh no, the force is strong
You know ya done me wrong
I never let a feeling lead my mind

I gotta rise above
Don’t need to fret
Cause if I was to take you home
What’s left when the danger’s gone?
I never let a feeling lead my mind

Would you like to know, me better, baby?
Then what you could show me, better, maybe?
Well, I sure don’t wanna waste your time
Sure don’t wanna waste your time
So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you

Duck down, the bullets gone
Slow motion, switch me on
I never let desire lead me blind
(Won’t give it up)
Freeze frame, I dodged that shot
The bigger picture’s not good enough
I never let a feeling lead my mind
I gotta rise above

I gotta rise above
Don’t need to fret
Cause I would rather be alone
Then with you in danger zone
I never let a feeling lead my mind

Would you like to know, me better, baby?
Then what you could show me, better, maybe?
Well, I sure don’t wanna waste your time
Sure don’t wanna waste your time
So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you

So let me tell ya that I’d be, better off without you

There I said I’m better off without you
There I said I’m better off without you
(Better of without you, yeah)
(Better of without you, without you, yeah)
Ooooh, yeeeah, I’d be better off without you
Better off without 

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

I hate the bar (IGH!)
Pharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic
Took the car (IGH!)
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it—skrrrt!
Crash on the floor, catch the z-z-z's (Hunh)
Popping the polar opposite of NZT (Hunh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (Name-brand)
But I done seen how the *censored* did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (IGH!)
I'll be gone 'til November, all my city call for Simba (IGH!)
Dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
Nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)
Nigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
The rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red (Woo!)
I'm crawling back to your bed
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights
When the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here
With the vultures, hissing and circling
You didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)

Ooh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you (IGH!)

All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much (Too much, I drink too much)
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed
All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

Now and then, I'm a mess
Please don't hold that against me

Back where we left off, watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself, remembering you
Your body hurts me, loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

Some prick at the party, all scripts and boasts
A dead-eyed actress girl, and then there's you
Venus in Converse, you put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us

Sunrise in Hollywood, we ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster, me and 

I tell all Spanish bitches, "dímelo"
She say it's for her and not for me to know
She always wanna know why I don't let her roll
So shit, just say for you it's just for me to know
I said the faces in my Rollie never tick tock
Stacking paper 'til it's at the tip top (Tip it)
I know why they mad, 'cause my shit pop
Driving to success so fuck a pit stop
Swear I did it all for some Adidas
I'm the one that said fuck any non-believers
Homeboy, I know you love to think you fucking wit' me
Just keep it real my G, who really run the city?
Fargo got 'em bunch of bitches in the Caravan
Step off in your bitches like a pair of Vans
Damn this white bitch with me look like Marilyn
My life just like a movie that could never end

And it's all in one night, since everyone around
We brought everyone up out of their home for one night
So let's get right

I got big plans for some big guap
Girl, these niggas sayin I'll be rich

If I go reaching for a fail, I'll probably miss
The realest song up of the year is probably this
I see these niggas talk so down 'bout a nigga, man
But you know that I'm rich and I don't give a damn
I'm ridin' 'round the town in that 911
