I'm howling at the moon
Harry fucking Henderson
Catch me in the mood
I ain't too cool for wrecking shit
Stoners on the loose
Call that shit a hippy flip
And we just getting going
Yeah this shit's just my starter kit
I'm on a good one, real fucking good one
I'm feeling brand new, yeah I'm talking redone
I'm talking 'bout me, talking 'bout the real one
I'm not with Jenny tossin' rocks at the building
Highly stoned, all that shit
So fly, call me pilot
MCs getting tourniquet
Body bag that murder vic'
The seven dance is evident
We stampede: an elephant
We crash out on king beds, y'all bitches soft like pillow mints

We're so cruel

Act so pure, but you're far from farm breed
Think your charm could disarm an army
Said it's hard to stop me, I'm far from obvi
Us when a bus parks fucking hockey
Her pot of coffee, we're in Abu Dhabi
And my dick went limp like some Laffy Taffy
But her body stopped me, and I'm tired of talking
You want an accent? Here's a mouth full of Cockney
Said you want ring and you think that I'll drop knee
Just for some pussy that'll bust outta Box Spring
All of the times that you tried to off me
The tables are turned and now the music is offbeat
You wanted me back, so you keep kissing me softly
I'd rather jack off in a sock with some hot tea
I'm over and out well like a walkity-talkie
I'm leaving now bitch, try to stop me

We're so cruel
Yeah, cruel
Yeah, cruel
Alright
No, we're so cruel

Well this is how it starts
Two lovers in the dark
On the run from the one
That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side
And bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty
And they were nearly free
But were seen by the good eye
Of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs
They're on the run
It's the two outsiders
Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that we could stay here
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely
Baby, you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriff's posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey
And they partied every night
Like it could be the last
The bounty said to shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer
Knew it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running
'Til they found their paradise
But the sheriff finally found them
With his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down
And fill him full of lead
They were finally free
To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did
He looked at her and then he said
I said I think that we can stay here
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby, you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well you're my green-eyed girl
And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off
Or take your shirt off
And we should go hit the cantina
We got work off
I said it's hot outside
Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach
That's why it's salty when we kiss
I said I think that we can stay here
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely
Baby you can lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down, no
Lay me down
Lay me
