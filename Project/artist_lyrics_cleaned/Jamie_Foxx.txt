Can I, can I, save you from you?
'Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do, girl
'Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'ma say to make you mine
But live, girl, have some fun, girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all

So who am I to judge you on the past, girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type? (Uh, yeah)
For your type (Uh, look)

Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl, quit playin', you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no, I get it, girl, I'm wit' it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
'Cause man, it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall
I swear, I always fall for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type?
For your type

I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like

I am Thor with the war hammer and a black BaxWar banner
You’re Spawn and Bruce Wayne?
I am David Banner with poor manners
I am also three characters, Silver Surfer, I absorb planets
Watched your battles
Shit put me to sleep, like I took four Xanax
Dog, you know how much fuckin' pussy I gave up to watch all these battles? It’s fucking retarded, dude
Silver tongued devil spittin' fire, like I am Godzilla
That’s five super heroes, from two really ill and odd villains
I’m not chillin’, I’m killin’, I’m shadowboxing with Satan, noobie
I work with Todd McFarlane
But saw Spawn, I fucking hate the movie
I’m Evel Knievel, you got a feeble cerebral, with a divaish ego
I’m Canadian, right? So tonight, just leave it to beaver
Oh ok, I won’t talk about you being a gay bastard
Doing battles with a slave master
You will cave faster than eight ratchets
Putting you in a grave casket
I’ll send flowers and a grape basket
No one crying for you like 2Pac, everybody already way past it
The shit you make up, it is Maybelline
Half my shit is make belief
I’m a staple like the maple leaf
Stitched on to the Toronto Maple Leafs
You’re a grape I eat, I’m a hawk, you’re the snake beneath
I could break your teeth. I feel like a masked man standing on the planet of the apes it seems
It’s a fact, it’s not an act
Our lives been filled with agonizing terror
It's an error to call him faggot
But this faggot should not be antagonizing terror
This dragon’s eyes are magnifying, clearer looking in the mirror
My second trick, I'll make another battle rapper disappear
My vision, it is crystal clear, let’s compare the end of fiscal years
I will physically tear your heart out of your chest, make it visible here
Still pumping rapidly, blood dripping down my sweaty palms
My machete’s long
You always stretch like Armstrong
To rock steady, to make songs, like your arm's strong, steady but you’re not ready
I’m a lot better, I’m a hot spitter, you’re a prop getter
I’m the top wizard, you’re a lot lizard
Get it? Lot lizard? Sucking cock in every fucking truck that stop to make his knot bigger
You ain't hot ni— aww I can’t say that word
I will rock ni— aww I can’t say that word
You went from nothing, to a total fuckin retard
But that got you on the playing field
But I’m the sickest rapper in here and do not need any Day quill
Enough is enough, it’s time to move on and look for some new concepts
I’m a constant reminder that monsters will find you
And I am the new bomb threat
How is it that I’m a Gulf Iraq war and Vietnam vet?
Meaning I’m a veteran of the new school, because lyrically I’m complex
Superior, but I don't have a complex. It’s complex
Demons fighting angels, kids they feel like inner conflicts
And I’m not trying to be a dick and I’m not saying you’ve had your palms read
But half your friends are gonna end up dead, or end up convicts
Cuz half my friends are dead now, the other half are convicts
Some of them are millionaires, just chillin' on some calm shit
But that’s a small percentage, that gon' make it past the finish line
But fuck it I’ll be Popeye, now it’s eat a can of spinach time
East indian killers, Asian triad gangs, and 1 percenters
Trust me this is not a topic concept that you want to enter
I grew up with organized crime, actual tactical assassins and mass murderers
You grew up with drive-bys, crack dealers, and cat burglars
I grew up with body snatchers, home invasions, sociopaths and kidnapping
When you talk about 'I’m reppin’ for my hood' that’s little kid rapping
You fucking clown, if street battle rappers shot guns as much as these street battle rappers said, guess what?
By now there wouldn’t be a single fucking battle rapper left
I said if y'all really killers, there wouldn’t be no battlers left
So it’s hard for light to shine, when he's standing right beside the shadow of death
I said plus guns are legal in America, think about it
Moms have them in their purses, guns are legal in America
So all of them bars are out of season
Cuz when we got straps in Canada, we got them for a reason!

I say yo, this the round where I got em screaming that 'nigga’s bars is nuts'
Hey, this is my biggest payday, shit
Everything in front of me get plain crashed; better call in they mayday biz
Put this in reverse dog, you battling a god
That’s why they pray, they say 'hey, you seen that new shit that Day Day did?'
I came to melee wigs. I’m bout to do child badder than Bébé Kids
They wonder if homie gonna spit off
I’ll pull up with lines like I’m slowly on a dip pole
Soon as he step to the front he defeated like homie on his tip toes
I sidestep him, but I’m the Ginóbili of this shit oh
Guaranteed to hit the shot, I'm Kobe on a pick roll
I’ll snap on every round that hit the board; I'm a hungry hungry hippo
I’ll leave this pussy wet if I find him in the G-spot
I had Dots following your tail, like they following a peacock
I put hands on his mouth, we tried to give him beat box
I'll put the pump to his tongue, we tryin' to give him Reeboks
You still want the problems? Then I'ma give em street docs
See these pushed back; I tried to give him Detox
You got options, you could get the llama, or the heat Glock
Here is my handle, here is my spout; I’m a little teapot!
I said you better be afraid, cuz I got a hella crazy llama
That bitch hit everybody in the room, like Skelly baby mama
That Pat Stay battle, I told y'all I got a plan
Now I’m on stage armed with more neat-o lines than Hollohan
But it's the reason Bishop, that’s why they passing me checks
Y'all made me battle another washed up ass rapper
With that stiff ass Cassidy neck
I bet $35.00 you can’t do this… (puts chin over shoulder)
(Madchild tries to do it)
No no no no no no. Get your chin over your shoulder... not happening!
Yea real nigga, y'all know I write
If one of your mans get to trippin'
I’m off the stage with my arsenal, like the Showwoutt fight
2015, I told y'all I got this one
You win some, and you lose some but you live to see another day…
Well, not this 

And when God woke up that morning
And He called out her name
And when she didn't answer
Heaven will never, ever, ever be
Heaven will never be the same
Mmm, never be the same, yeah

I always dreamed that it would happen
I just didn't know exactly when
All my life I've been waiting for something amazing
Said it took a while but now I know
So tell me can I get a witness
If you believe in miracles, oh
And the proof I have is living
And my life will never, ever be
And your life don't have to be the—

And when God woke up that morning
Said, "Where has my little angel gone?"
And when she didn't answer
Heaven will never, ever, ever be
