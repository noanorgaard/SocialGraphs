"Always ends the same
Ah, remember, dear, this too shall pass
And it always ends the same"

Well, I was feeling so alone
When the congregation sang
Of Jesus Christ and Lucifer
And the price that I would pay
But the preacher told me not to fear
For they know not what they say
"Yeah, the history is on your side
And it always ends the same"

Now the fishes on the TV fly
In circles all the same
Like little children terrified
By what they can't explain
But when the suburb and the sky
Are both awash in flame

It always ends the same, you know
Always ends the same
Oh, remember, dear, this too shall pass
And it always ends the same

And when I'm finally old enough
To learn to play the game
Oh, the dinosaurs will roam the earth
And resume their bloody reign
But when I hear their victory song
I will hum the old refrain
No life can live forever on
And it always ends the same
It always ends the same, you know
Always ends the same
Oh, remember, dear, this too shall pass

And I've seen you act this way before
It's not as funny anymore

To little boys who fantasize
And dream of toys instead of wives

And it's a sad charade I leave you in
A wicked way to see it end
Still calling out without a friend

Once Buddy was handsome, he outshone them all
Now he’s fat and he’s lonesome with no one to call

Well, Christine loved a nice boy until her boy died
And she’s punching the walls now and wanting to cry
She said, "Oh, if I got me a gun
Blew my brain from its body, would I finally be done?"
No

Now you're singing in the subway
Spilling onions from your mouth
Now you're lying in the hallway
Trying to sink into the ground
Telling stories to a screen
Making signals of yourself
Oh, you were just some old idea I found

Now you're diving to the depths
Of the rubble of a storm
Raise your hand up in a fist
Throw a chain across the door
Were you lying when you said
We would settle all these scores?
Oh, you were just some old idea I wore

Now you're chasing after tyrants
Beating drums and throwing stones
Giving substance to the silence
Of your well-appointed home
Giving comfort to the guilty
With every well-intentioned blow
