My good mother she's a tailor
She sews the new blue jeans
My sweetheart, he's a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

If I hadn't done what my mother said
I'd be at home today
But me bein' young and foolish, poor girl
Let a gamblin' man lead me astray

Gonna tell my baby sister
Not to do just like I'd done
To shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun

Well, I'm goin' on back down to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Goin' back to spend the rest, the rest of my days
Beneath that Risin' Sun
You might also like
Lordy, mama
Beneath the Rising
