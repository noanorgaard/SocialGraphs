It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it's capsized
It's finally done, the battle's lost, yet I feel I've won

It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight
I'm high, staring at the ceiling

It feels good for the first time in a while I'm free

I'm high, staring at the ceiling

And what did you say back to me?
Dreaming of Maybach cruising
Maybe talking crazy, but I want it
A hundred thousand ways of choosing
Who the hell is out and who's in trouble?
Maybe I'm too subtle

Mouth is made of metal, metal, metal
Pocket full of yellow, yellow, pocket full of gold
And I hope you find, I hope you find your dream
And darling never settle, settle, settle
Chasin' down the devil, devil
Chasin' down the gods
And I hope you find, I hope you find your dream

I'm livin' like a silent movie
Shut your mouth and see straight through me
Findin' that you're hiding in your money (money, m-m-m-money)
I got a million ways of losin'
But nothing in my life worth proving
Chasing, all my time is wasted

It's the push and the pull
It's the rise and the fall
I don't owe you a single thing
I don't owe you anything
It's the push and the pull
It's the big and the small
I don't owe you a single thing
Not a god damn thing
