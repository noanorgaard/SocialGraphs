And you mouth, it did hang wide
When you told me every little thing is going to be alright
But we were younger then, and now we're not
And if there was a plan made, then we forgot about it
And if there was time, I could figure it out now
But life is short
And I don't care for most of it
I don't care for most of it
You eyes, they did flutter again
And you mouth, it did hang
When you told me every little thing is going to be alright
But we were younger then
Because you're all that I-all that I want You might also
