Boy, what you waiting for?
It's open house, why don't you take a tour
You got them keys so open up the door
Oh, you're what I need, boy, I been looking forward to you
I'll be waiting

I been thinking 'bout you
Can't get you off my mind
And if I gave it to you, boy, could you love me right
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over
Boy, could you drive me crazy
Take me for a ride
Would it be amazing
If I was yours tonight
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over
