So pack up your bags and fly
You've got some living before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

So Marie and 'Gill, they took to the hills
And climbed a hundred miles until
They found a spot where they could be at ease
It was the highest point that they could see
Rose far above the tallest trees
So naturally, they became king and queen
But before they'd laid their regal grounds
The sky had darkened all around
The heavens broke, and rain began to fall
The lightning cracked, the thunder clapped
And soon the king and queen were trapped
On an island sinking in the rising flood
Well poor Marie, she said, "The end's begun!
I've always had a place to run
I'm certain that this night will be our last."
But 'Gill said, "Marie, well you wouldn't believe
What lies inside of you and me --
Take my hand and we can be at peace."
You might also like
So lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)

For forty hours the storm raged on
And Gill, he said, "I had it wrong --
If we don't leave we're surely gonna die."
But sweet Marie, she said, "I see the light --
My dear McGill, you had it right
We just needed a little faith before we fly!
Because I've dreamed of what this world could be
In all its possibility
And I'll be damned if I don't get to see
So take my hand and hold it tight
We're gonna make it out alright
Jump with me and promise to believe."
Oh, pack up your bags and fly
We've got some dreaming before we die
We've got this feeling, don't ask us why
Don't ask us why, don't ask us why

Pack up your bags and fly
We've got some dreaming before we die
We've got this feeling, don't ask us why
Don't ask us why, don't ask us why
No, don't ask me
