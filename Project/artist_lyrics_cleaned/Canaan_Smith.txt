Yeah, we're in it one minute
Then we're flipping that switch
Yeah, it's on again off again

We got that mad love
Haters gonna hate us
Yeah, you and me together
Some kinda crazy
But that's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
Sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
You might also like
She give me the goodbyes
Break out the long nights
Baby I know when
The blames died down
Find us some rescue
Alone in the bedroom
Turning on the night
And turn it back around

As we got that mad love
Haters gonna hate us
Yeah, you and me together
Some kinda crazy
But that's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
Sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
Oh no, baby
Yeah, we're in it one minute
Then we're flipping that switch
Yeah, it's on again off again

We got that mad love
Haters gonna hate us
Yeah, you and me together
Some kinda crazy
That's us
Doin' our thing
Throwing more gas on the fire
As sure as the rain
Rolling off of this roof
You'll get her crying
Like Johnny and June
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
We got that mad love
Can't stop this mad love
