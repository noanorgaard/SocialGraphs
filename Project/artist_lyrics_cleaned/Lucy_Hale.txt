It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me

Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothing out
'Cause baby, I ain't in a hurry
Every little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your lips
Oh, when you give me that kiss

Darling, it's you I remember with your red dress on
Dancing in the moonlight 'til the break of dawn
It's you I remember dancing with your red dress on
And baby, it's you I remember when I hear that song
Singing out the chorus 'til your voice was gone
It's you I remember every time I hear that song

Not a day goes by without thinking that I see
Your face in the crowd turning away from me
So the days go by like a reoccurring dream
Where every night ends with the same old memory

And baby, it's you I remember when I hear that song
Singing out the chorus 'til your voice was gone
It's you I remember every time I hear that song
Darling, it's you I remember with your red dress on
Dancing in the moonlight 'til the break of dawn
It's you I remember dancing with your red dress on
Dancing with your red dress on

I don't know the game we're playing
You and I were on to something
How did we fall apart without asking ourselves why?
Looking back, I can't help thinking
If somehow I had just stopped running
I would have held you close and never said goodbye

Darling, it's you I remember with your red dress on
Dancing in the moonlight 'til the break of dawn
It's you I remember dancing with your red dress on
And baby, it's you I remember when I hear that song
Singing out the chorus 'til your voice was gone
It's you I remember every time I hear that song
Darling, it's you I remember with your red dress on
Dancing in the moonlight 'til the break of dawn
It's you I remember dancing with your red dress on
And baby, it's you I remember when I hear that song
Singing out the chorus 'til your voice was gone
It's you I remember every time I hear that song
Dancing with your red dress on
Whoa-oh
Dancing with your red dress 

The truth is, I'm falling to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is, the truth keeps slipping out
Can't seem to hide what I'm feeling
Can't believe what I'm saying out loud
Truth is, there's no turning back now
I guess I should've learned how to lie a little better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh

Been trying to cover
This heart out on my sleeve
Been set on playing this down, but
I think you're catching on to me

Well, I guess I should've learned how to lie a little better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh

I'm losing this battle
With every word I say
Wish I had a better lesson
Of not giving myself away 'cause

The truth is, I'm falling to pieces
