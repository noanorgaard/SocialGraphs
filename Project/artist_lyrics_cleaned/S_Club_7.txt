Tell me
Have you ever loved and lost somebody?
Wish there was a chance to say I'm sorry
Can't you see?
That's the way I feel about you and me, baby
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking?
Lookin' down the road you should be taking
I should know
Cause I loved and lost the day I let you go

Can't help but think that this is wrong
We should be together
Back in your arms where I belong
Now I've finally realized, it was forever that I'd found
I'd give it all to change the way the world goes round

Hold on to what you try to be
Your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders
Just smile and let it go
If people try to put you down
Just walk on by, don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself

Don't you know it's true what they say
That life, it ain't easy
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (bring it all back now, yeah, yeah)

Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it could be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
