Yes, I know, it's not there
But, I don't know if I care
Yes, I know, it's not there
But, I don't know if I care

It's impossible to find
The feeling that we left behind
And it's impossible to stay
When you make me feel this way

Yes, I know it's not there
But, I don't know if I care

Yes, I know it's not there
But, I don't know if I care
Yes, I know it's not there
But, I don't know if I care
Yes, I know it's not there
It was lost in the air

Sometimes I don't know where we're going
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it, it will be too late to see
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you've always made me feel a fool
The guilt you hide will come between us after all

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all

Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all
Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all

And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these

Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself

You got me so wild
Why should I be so surprised?
You got me so high
Don't you see it in my eyes?
