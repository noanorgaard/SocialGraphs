Hey, let me start it off by sayin' this
You mean everything to me, nothin' I wouldn't risk
Every single second and moment that passes by
I'm thinkin' about you, and I really want you to know that
There's somethin' more out there
Somethin' that will hold you very tight when you're scared
'Cause I know when times get tough and it starts to feel rough
It can feel like everything's crashin' down on ya

So when it seems like every road you're on has hit a dead end
There is hope
Let me show

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S. when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alo-o-o-o-one
You'll never be alo-o-o-o-one

Man, crazy how you got this far
I'd be sittin' just wonderin' where to start
Last week you were sayin' that somethin' just ain't right
Layin' in your bed, stayin' up all night 'cause
This life is harder than it seems
But one thing I've learned is never stop chasin' your dreams
And if it, if it ever gets too hectic for you
Stop for a second and remember one thing

So when it seems like every road you're on has hit a dead end
There is hope
Let me show...

I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S. when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alo-o-o-o-one
You'll never be alo-o-o-o-one

Sometimes life is an ocean
We're just trying to flow
We get caught in slow motion
From the undertow
Sometimes the path to choose
Is right in front of you
You just gotta let go
I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S. when you've lost your phone
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones
I'll show you the signs
To let you know
You'll never be alone
I'm the street lights that guide you home
I'll be the G.P.S. when you've lost your phone (Lost your phone)
I'll be the song that's rockin' in your headphones (Your headphones)
I'll show you the signs (Show you the signs)
To let you know
You'll never be alo-o-o-o-one
You'll never be 

Whoa
I gave it all

You got me livin' how I've wanted all along
Now all my tears are dried away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along

I feel so alive, alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

How was I supposed to survive in this vast sea?
I was so scared my own heart would try to abandon me
Now I've got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away

'Cause my heart has been revived

I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
I feel a sweet increase
Consuming all of me

Consuming all of me
