Yeah you take a bad boy
Take a bad boy home to see

Street lights, late nights, he wants to
Take you for a ride on his motorbike
You finally got the chance to feel alive and let go tonight
He watches James Dean on movie screens
Smokes straights, wears leather and tight jeans
He's the man that you need in your dreams when you're sleeping tonight

Pick yourself up, wipe your tears dry, try to find the confidence you're holding inside

Pick yourself up, wipe your tears dry, try to find the confidence you're holding inside
