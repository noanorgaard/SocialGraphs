All my bitches look like models (Ooh)
Drinkin' Henny out the bottle (Ooh)
Your bitch callin' me her father, papi
All that talkin', I hear nada, nothing

When every nigga want you
All that money come through
All these haters acting reckless
But what the fuck they gon' do?
They won't do nada
All these haters won't do nada
All my bitches on cue
Might just run up on you
Tell me what you gon' do
When we pull up, come through?
You won't do nada
When I pull up, won't do nada

They don't do nada
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
Ask them what they want, say nada
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
When niggas talkin' all that
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
It'll get back to me, mañana
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
(Just watch)

I ain't gon' trip, I'ma sit back and sip
Watch it roll off your lips
Bitch like me, heard you was talking shit
But won't say it to my face
Here we go, didn't niggas let you know?
I ain't one to let shit go
Young OG, you don't want nada from me
You don't want nothing from me

They don't do nada
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
Ask them what they want, say nada
(Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah-nah)
When niggas talkin' all that

Ayy, 
All these haters talkin' shit
Doin' it on the internet
I don't see why they're talkin' shit
If talking shit don't benefit
See me, I'm all 'bout paper though
They don’t want real smoke
They're more like vapers
I said farewell to my haters
Like Kobe said to the Lakers
I need a mansion on an acre
Somewhere north of Decatur
With a bad bitch who love to cook my taters<
All my, all my niggas, all my niggas, on go for Boat
Aimin' at your nose, pointed at your throat

When every nigga want you (Ooh)
All that money come through (Ooh-ooh)
All these haters acting reckless (Ooh)
But what the fuck they gon' do? (Ooh-ooh)
They won't do nada (They won't do nada)

You won't do nada (They won't do nada)
When I pull up, won't do nada (They won't do nada)
