But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, yours
Thank God I'm
