Countless skies that I've painted
Surely, this is where my heart finally doesn't fall apart
Won't fall apart

Jumping high from my dreams, I'll fly, no matter what the cost
Today, I'll find a way to shake off all the pain
Within my dreams, I'll touch the sky
But I still realize, I won't survive the fight without you by my side
You give me light when I have lost my way
I fall asleep because I always find you in my dreams

I wanna always be with you
I'll give you everything I have

The guiding light I found, if I feel it for myself, I'll remember everything
Moments in my mind that were lost, I know I'll find
I can't replace them
You might also like
Just let me close my eyes, take me to a new world
Where I can change my name, and hide away from all my pain
It's not the same

When I drift off, I go so far, the wish that's in my heart
Don't wait or hesitate, like I did at the start
Carry you straight across that line
Now place your hand in mine, I swear, I'll keep you safe until the end of time
I'll give you light when you have lost your way
So fall asleep because from there I'll meet you in our dreams


Jumping high from my dreams, I'll fly, no matter what the cost
Today, I'll find a way to shake off all the pain

Jumping high from my dreams, I'll fly, no matter what the cost
Today, I'll find a way to shake off all the pain
Within my dreams, I'll touch the sky
But I still realize, I won't survive the fight without you by my side
You give me light when I have lost my way
I fall asleep because I always find you in my dreams
I wanna always be with you
I wanna hold you tight right now
I swear I'll wipe away your tears
I'll give you everything I 

It's been years I've been alone in here
I've forgotten what it's like for me to smell your fear
Am I driving you insane? Am I eating at your brain?
No happy endings will ever find you
Your heavy breathing and pain will end soon
You're pickin' up the pieces to the ghosts that'll haunt you too
(Five nights!) Five Nights at Freddy's
Now it's the finale and you weren't ready
(Don't cry!) We're not so scary
Don't make a scene and we'll end this quickly
(Maybe you've just lost your mind)
Kickin' and screamin', now you've lost your time
But we all know you're said and done
We're voices in your head
We're the monsters under your bed
There's no tomorrow for you, no matter what they said
You know who you are (Know who you are)
And we know everything (Know everything)
You've come so far (You've come so far)
Now you pull the strings
(That's right!)

(Ah) Oh, oh, oh
(Ah) Oh, oh, oh
(Ah) Oh, oh, oh, ah
(Five nights!) Five Nights at Freddy's
Now it's the finale and you weren't ready
(Don't cry!) We're not so scary
Don't make a scene and we'll end this quickly
(Maybe you've just lost your mind)
Kickin' and screamin', now you've lost your time
But we all know you're said and
