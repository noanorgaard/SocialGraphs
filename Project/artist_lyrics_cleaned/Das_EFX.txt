Well I'll be darned, shiver me timbers, yo, head for the hills!
I picked a weeping willow, and a daffodil
So back up bucko or I'll pulverize McGruff
'Cause this little piggy gets busy and stuff
Arrivederci, heavens to mercy, honky tonk, I get swift
I caught a Snuffleupagus and smoked a boogaloo spliff
I got the nooks, the crannies, the nitty gritty 40 doe
So all aboard, castaway, hey, where's my boogaloo?
Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh, I'm steamin', agony!
Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
They call me Puddin' Tane, and rap's my game
You ask me again and I'll t-tell you the same
Since I'm the vocal vegemintarian, hon, stick 'em up freeze
So no Parks sausages, mom, please
A-Blitz shoots the breeze, twiddly-dee shoots his lip
Krazy Drayzie shot the sheriff, yup, and I shot the gift
And that's pretty sneaky, sis, oh, yo
I got my socks off, my rocks off, my Nestle's cup of cocoa
Holly Hobbie tried to slob me, tried to rob me, silly stunt
Diggedy dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, dun-dun!

Yahoo, hi-de-ho, yup, I'm coming around the stretch
So here, Fido boy, fetch, boy, fetch
I got the rope-a-dope a slippery choker, look at me get raw
And I'm the hickory-dickory top of the morning boogoloo big jaw
With the yippedy zippedy Winnie the Pooh bad boy blue
Ayo, Krazy, I got the gusto, what up, I swing that too
So nincompoop, I gave a hoot and stomp a troop without a strain
Like Rosco P. Coltrane
I spiggedy-spark a spiff and give a twist like Chubby Checker
I take my Froot Loops with two scoops, make it double decker
Oh, Finster Baby, come to Papa Duke
A babaloo, ooh, a babaloo, boogedy-boo
I went from Gucci to Stussy, to fliggedy-flam a groupie
To Zsa Zsa, to yibbedy-yabba dabba hoochie koochie
Tally ho, I-I'll take my Stove Top instead of potato, so
Maybe I'll shoot 'em now, nope, maybe I'll shoot 'em later, yep
I used to have a dog and Bingo was his name-oh, so, uh

Well on your mark and get set, can't forget to go

Yo, you niggedy-know that I'm back, man
You're wack man, I eat a rapper like I'm Pac Man

You don't impress me, a-yo Books kick the rest, G
Uhh, one time for your mind...

Ayo, what up? It's the crew bringing the ruckus, no doubt
We's the roughest dream team, Reign Supreme like a Cutlass
Getting ducats, the dough, you can't touch the flow
It's me, the nigga wit' G, the B double O K-S
So say yes and bust your caliber
When I pop shit and rock shit like Metallica
Stakes through the hearts of them snake fake niggas
Them all up in my face, jealous of my tape niggas
So honey shake your figures and show me whatcha got

Ayo, MC's is irrelevant, and delicate to the texture
But this style of mine is well defined like Webster
Ain’t a badder nigga raw from the jaw than the Jabber-Jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy-rip the microphone to shreds
Dread, yo come and hit these niggas in the head

Well I connect my rhymes like Lego, so l'eggo my Eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep 'em moving like I'm U-Haul
I'm here to school y'all figgedy-faggots like RuPaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC

Yo, Im about to pull the plug out
Thug out, but rub out
Head for my car, get blazed, turn the whole club out
Shit I set it for real when I bug out
My trey mark making it possible for paramedics to pull the plug out

Yo, we just seep underground to be dug out
We represent the Ruffhouse
Keep one and a half, even while I'm banned
At the thug house (tha'ts right)
Now you're facing a one of a kind dude
Undefined dude, top of the line dude

Aiyyo, we giggity getting bug in here
All my people up in here

Bullets figgity flying every fucking where
Its un fucking faitiggity tear cats out the frame
Diggity Das, Billy Danz, Teflon, and Lil Fame
Chorus - 2x

Say hello to the bad guy
Hmmhm, excuse me as I
Grab my N-U-Ts no need to ask why
We blow the spot up
Hit em with the uncut raw
Could be somewhat more
Advance with the product
You dealing with sacrifice, real hardcore
All the love for these thugs that Im willing to die for
First family staff Its deep
You catch us on these beats
But we should never be disconnected from these streets

See my higgity hard times
That bring forth these higgity hard rhymes
Hard crimes, leave em hospitalized with scar lines
Figgity far rhymes, my squad shines, Its turn to eat again
Motivated by cats who would never see the street again

See him in the next life cause thats where were gon meet again
And if it goes down then, you gon bleed again
Any ground I roam I stand on it
Keep a llama with eight shots and my hand on it

Yeah, so lets expand on it ( what )
Put my mans on it ( what )
Its the shit that make flies wanna land on it ( what )
The Higgity Hit Squad and Firing Squad
We drillin ya, killin ya, figgity feelin ya til the next millennia
