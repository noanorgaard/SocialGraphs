On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I, oh-oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh, yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough

Been a fool, girl, I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me
'Til this house feels like it did before

Feels like insomnia, ah
Feels like insomnia, ah
Feels like insomnia, ah
Feels like insomnia, ah

Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think that I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now, I'm sitting here, thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

Been a fool (Fool), girl, I know (Know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (Time), you'll change your mind (Mind)
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (Without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (To me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

Because it feels like insomnia, ah (Ah)
Feels like insomnia, ah
Feels like insomnia, ah (Ah)

Ah, I just can't go to sleep
'Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And I know that it's love because
I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (Without you no more)
