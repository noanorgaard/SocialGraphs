You called me loved
You called me loved
By the blood of the Lamb, of Your Son
Comes to me, sweet salvation

You called me clean
You called me clean
Light of life, You are shining through me
White as snow, I'm sealed and complete

You are beautiful
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful
You are beautiful in all Your ways

Oh-whoa oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa oh

The grave has no hold over me
The grave has no hold over me
Death's cold sting, you've tasted defeat
Redemption's blood has won this sweet victory
You might also like
You are beautiful
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful
You are beautiful in all Your ways


You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your ways
You are beautiful in all Your
