You know that I want you head down and your ass up
You've got that spaceship like you squat with nasa
I was tryna' fuck you in the past right now and after
This dick gon' make you fall and I might catch ya

Caught in the bait
Sugar rush lost in the cake
Got the cotty and shes wet as a lake
Long as it takes she travels to come to my place
Fuck around and then im done on her face
She like it nasty
She likes the way I dont know when they ask me
She likes the way I run it like a track meet
Ain't looking back cause none of it get past me
Skinny nigga flexing like an athlete
Smarter than her nigga like a mathlete
When I fuck her imma stretch her like she taffy
Give her back to you the same like shes elastic

You mad at the love of her life, cyph
The nigga she let hit it right
Met up in the heights let her smoke it that one night
Pass her to continue the cyph
Someone get him a light
Cause this nigga is boiling he look like he tight
Overweight nigga mad cause she gave me a bite
She said you lightly salted like a bag of lays
Cause she fucked me when you stepped away
Nigga I am talking every day
She loves it when i fuck around and say
