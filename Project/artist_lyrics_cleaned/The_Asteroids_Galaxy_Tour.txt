I’m on my way, gon' make it big, gon' make the songs for the chicks to dig
It’s really hot and a little bit sour, we’re getting your strength to maximum power
Flying away from reality, whatever-ever happened to gravity?
I see it clear, a shooting star!
I’m a really good singer la-di-da-da-da!

Sing it out loud, gonna get back, honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me

Oh, silver screen on a rainy day, Sally Bowles in a cabaret
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart
My mind is set, I walk the line
But I never really thought it would feel this fine! Yeah!
