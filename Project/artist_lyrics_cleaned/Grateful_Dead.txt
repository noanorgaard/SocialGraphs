Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine

What are they feeling when they see each other's smile?
Is it a love I've never known or an emotion that I've outgrown?
Did I take a wrong turnin' on life's winding road?
Won't somebody help me find the, find the right way to go?
My life need some correction, alteration in direction
Won't someone come with me for a while, for a while, yes, yes I'm lost
What is the secret of this tie that binds
Two souls in communion, both body and mind
Is it special magic or just the nature of things?
Conceived of great spirit, not for beggars but kings
You who have found it, please help me along
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm not, I'm not made out of stone
My needs they are simple, I don't want many things
But I truly want to fly on them wings of love one more time
That's all I need
I wanna fly on them wings
I wanna fly on them wings of love
I'm a stranger here
Won't somebody help me now
I wake up early in the morning
You know, you know, you know my pillow gets soaking wet
All I need, all I need
That's to fly on them wings
I'm in love one more time
I'm a stranger in your town
Don't  on them wingsYou might also

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat

You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Long distance runner, what you holdin out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
