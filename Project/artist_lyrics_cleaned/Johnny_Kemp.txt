Check the mirror, I'm looking fly
Round up my posse, jump in my ride
Radio rocking a monster jam
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound

Feeling so good
Don't you know I'm just grooving to the beat?
I'm grooving, grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Just got paid; it's Friday night
Party hunting, the bass is right
Booty shaking all around
Poured my drink, now I'm getting down

On the floor rocking to the beat
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady, standing by
Come on, baby, sweet eye delight
You might also like
I love the way that you move; you look so sweet
When you're moving to the beat
I'm tired of all these boring parties
Why don't we get on down?
Come on, let's get on down now


Getting down
Say ho (You say it)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho

On the floor rocking to the beat (Rocking, baby)
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady standing by (Come here)
Come on, baby, look me in my eye


Getting down, yeah, getting down
Say ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho-ho)
Say ho
Teddy, you play it
Shake it up, shake it up
I just got paid
I'm feeling, I'm feeling right


Just got paid, it's Friday
 have a good time
Having a good time, baby
Having a good time, baby
I'm getting down
Getting down, getting down

I'm getting down down
I'm getting down
