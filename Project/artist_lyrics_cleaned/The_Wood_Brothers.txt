But people say I'm the luckiest man
Yeah, they say

Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
Too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man

I done talked to the devil when he calls my name
But sometimes when I'm losing it all seems the same
And when I fall I'm back up again
Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in

But people say I'm the luckiest man
Yeah, they say

Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man

Try to keep my faith and keep my mind
Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind
And I can't help but mourning just a little each night
People say everything is gonna be alright

They say I'm the luckiest man
Yeah, they say

That running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man
You're the luckiest
