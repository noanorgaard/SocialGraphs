My uncle back, dad, look at all the work he did
Shawty got a man, taught her how to work the yeah (Work)
Topic of the gossip at the nail shop (Rich nigga)
A lotta traffic, time to get another mailbox (Uh)
Trap bumpin', good enough to go to hell 'bout
Caught a case and sold a brick outside the jailhouse (Huh)
Outside of the jailhouse (Huh, High Class Street Music 5)
Outside of the jailhouse
Dom P, that's for you suckers, we on Belaire
We in the corner with them killers, homie, hell yeah
Hundred niggas, but all it took him was one Glock
Gang signs, then all you heard was the gun shots
Bang, now you wanna do the duck walk
Candy paint got me lookin' like duck sauce (Boom)
Ten-piece shawty and I run the game (Nigga)
Double- M worth more than two hundred thangs (Maybach Music)

Keep it real with your dog no matter what (Preach)
Same bitch that claim she love you, she'll set you up (Preach)
Out here in these streets, it ain't no such thing as love (Preach)
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs (Preach)
Real nigga shit only what I do and speak
If that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech (Preach)
I ain't got shit for a nigga
Ain't nothin' in this motherfuckin' world free (Preach)

Couldn't get it from my mama, so I got it off the block
Been workin' my whole life, but I ain't never punched a clock (Trappin')
Nine years old, I seen a nigga get shot, damn (Damn)
Niggas quick to run they mouth when they get jammed (What?)
Pussy-ass nigga tell it on his own fam (Pussy)
The same nigga that you break your neck for (Yeah)
Be the same nigga that cross you out and wet you up (Ayy)
'Posed to be chasin' money, but you chasin' bitches (What you doin'?)
Real bosses don't talk, we just sit back and listen (Uh-huh)
Stack that paper up and then make boss moves (Yeah)
She like to argue, so I sent that bitch to law school

From the lock to the shop, told 'em cut the head off (Ayy)
You know the motto, ball 'til the feds cut your bread off
Let me take a second, welcome Ronnie Woods home
Yeah, this one for Memphis, talkin' Ronnie Woods home (Yeah)
If you're prayin' for my fall, you deserve to see me ballin' (The Plug Best Friend)
Chain lookin' like it came from Bourbon Street, New Orleans (Yeah)
Keep your frenemies close, keep that .40 cal closer
They call me Jeezy Montana when I bought that white poster (Haha)
Timid-dick nigga fall in love with the pussy (Hey)
