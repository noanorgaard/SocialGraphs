1 ContributorIsland (Tropical Edition) LyricsSoundcloud release from Spect and ANXT of the “Loonies”
The song doesn’t really deal with much, other than ANXT’s supposed sexual encounter in Thailand.

Yeah, Loonigans
ANXT, Spect
Yeah, Uh
Yeah

Rapping on an island, like Tom Hanks
More underrated than Lloyd Banks
Loonigans Music, makes up the ranks
More beef than Azealia Banks
I'm just kidding, please don't Twitter bitter me
And to the boys in Compton no itchy trigger fingers please
Tropical island surrounded by trees
No one else is here, so no birds and bees
So I'm alone
Don't want to call this place home
Talking about rap music to a tree
What is that on the horizon I see?

Nothing
Yeah
*cough*
You might also like
So let me tell y'all a story
About this time I went to Thailand and I got horny
I met this girl and we went back to her place
I had a few too many and I was pretty shit faced
Getting her into bed I felt like a genius
Next thing you know I pulled down her pants and she's got a penis
I screamed loudly and I hear some bells
Next thing you know I'm getting chased by the Thai cartel
I been drinking like I'm  from Ireland
Next thing you know I wake up on a tropical island

*pause*
(On a tropical island)
I'm a disgrace
(On a tropical island)
Think I'm losing my mind
(On a tropical island)
I got left behind
(on a tropical island)
I think I might be flying
(on a tropical island)
I'm probably dying
(on a tropical island)
No longer got rhymes
(on a tropical island)
Running out of time
(on a tropical island)
Spect
(on a tropical island)
ANXT
(on a tropical island)
Loonies
(on a tropical island)
Part One
(on a tropical island)
(On a tropical island)
(On a island)
That's
