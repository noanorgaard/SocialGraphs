I know I have the strength to move a hill
But I can hardly leave my room
So I'll sit here perfectly still
And I'll listen for a tune
While my mind is on the moon

And if I stumble
And if I stall
And if I slip now
And if I should fall
And if I can't be all that I could be
Will you, will you wait for me

'Cause everywhere I seem to be
I am only passing through
I dream these days about the sea
I always wake up feeling blue
Wishing I could dream of you
You might also like
So if I stumble
And if I fall
And if I slip now
And lose it all
And if I can't be all that I could be
Will you, will you wait for me

And wait for me
And wait for me
And wait for me
Won't you wait for me
And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me
And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me
And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me
And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me
And wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
Won't you wait for 

So don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
We're all lifers here
No eleventh hour reprieve
So don't forget to breathe
Keep your head above water
But don't forget to breathe

And all the suffering that you've witnessed
And the hand prints on the wall
They remind you how it's endless
How endlessly you fall
Then the answer that you're seeking
For the question that you found
Drives you further to confusion
As you lose your sense of ground
You might also like
So don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
We're all lifers here
No eleventh hour reprieve
So don't forget to breathe
Keep your head above water
But don't forget to breathe

Breathe
Don't forget to breathe
Don't forget to breathe
You know you are here
But you find you want to leave
So don't forget to
Breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just breathe
Just 

So I'm trying to put it right
'Cause I want to love you with my heart
All this trying has made me tired
And I don't know even where to start
Maybe that's a start

For you know it's a simple game
That you play, filling up your head with rain
And you know you've been hiding from your pain
In the way, in the way you say your name

And I see you
Hiding your face in your hands
Flying so you won't land
You think no one understands
No one understands
You might also like
So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head
And your throat is aching but you swear
No one hurts you, nothing could be said
Anyway you're not here enough to care

And you're so tired, you don't sleep at night
As your heart is trying to mend
You keep it quiet but you think you might
Disappear before the end

And it's strange how you cannot find
Any strength to even try
To find a voice to speak your mind
When you do, all you wanna do is cry
Well maybe you should cry

And I see you
Hiding your face in your hands
Talking 'bout far-away lands
You think no one understands
Listen to my hands
And all of this life
Moves around you
For all that you claim
You're standing still
You are moving too
You are moving too
You are moving too
I will move with
