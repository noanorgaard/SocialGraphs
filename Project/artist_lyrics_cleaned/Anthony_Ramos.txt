Blow us all away

Ladies, I'm lookin' for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father's legacy in front of a crowd
I can't have that, I'm making my father proud
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin' to see a play

Well, I'll go visit his box

And y'all look pretty good in ya' frocks
How 'bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?
Okay!
Blow, blow us all away!

George!
Shh

George!

Shh! I'm tryin' to watch the show!

Ya' shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!
I didn't say anything that wasn't true
Your father's a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

Ooh!

It's like that?

Yeah, I don't fool around
I'm not your little schoolboy friends

I'll see you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now!

I know where to find you, piss off
I'm watchin' this show now
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to
Slow down

I came to ask you for advice, this is my very first duel
They don't exactly cover this subject in boarding school

Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

Where is this happening?

Across the river, in Jersey

Everything is legal in New Jersey

Alright, so this is what you're gonna do
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

But what if he decides to shoot? Then I'm a goner

No, he'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor
To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake
Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak

Father

Promise me, you don't want this young man's blood on your conscience

Okay, I promise

Come back home when you're done
Take my guns, be smart, make me proud, son

My name is Philip, I am a poet
And I'm a little nervous, but I can't show it
I'm sorry, I'm a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

I'd rather skip the pleasantries, let's go
Grab your pistol

Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

Count to ten!

Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky

One, two, three, four

Five, six, 

Sometimes that’s how it goes

Daddy’s gonna find out any minute

Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
Since being one put me on the up and up again

No one knows who you are or what you do

They don’t need to know me
They don’t like you

Excuse me?

Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—

Wait
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it

I’ve always considered you a friend

I don’t see why that has to end
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the
