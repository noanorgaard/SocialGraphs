We are, we are the ones
We are, we are the ones

We get it how we live folk
This is for all my kinfolk
Get live let it ride for the lost soul
Down for my kinfolk, down for my kinfolk
What you think we're here for
Down for my kinfolk, we are, we are, we are the ones
We are, we are, we are the ones
Get it how we live folk
This is for all my kinfolk
We are, we are, we are

Enie minie mi mi many mo many mo
How many mo push pull pull to the pinnacle
No minimal never wanna plateau
Looped with a lasso
Handlin the hassle
What a rascal wicked wanna wrestle
Im look'n at the glass like its half full
Big boy bullying the beast who's bashful
Bang wit the child of the King in the castle
Fight to the death cause the spirit alive
You think this ain't about the king homeboy you falling for lies
This for my brothers and sisters who ride for the mission
In any condition they hold they position
Against opposition another dimension
The tension is risen ain't nobody flintchin'



We do it for the King for sure, He holds me close
We do it for the King you know, He'll never ever let us go
Never ever let you go, never ever let us go
