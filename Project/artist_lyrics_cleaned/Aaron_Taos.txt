Over and over in my thoughts
I can't get enough
Over and over keep on trying
I gotta make you mine
Over and over in my thoughts
Don't ever stop
Over and over I keep on trying
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

I know it's hard to resist telling the truth but I've been burned before
When I showed my heart and I played my cards too soon
Lesson learned, now I know the rules
But I can't shake this feeling and it's got me up on the ceiling for you

Over and over in my thoughts
I can't get enough
Over and over keep on trying
I gotta make you mine
Over and over in my thoughts
Don't ever stop
Over and over I keep on trying
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mindYou might also
