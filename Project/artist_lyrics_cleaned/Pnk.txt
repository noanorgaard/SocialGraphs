Can't handle it

Diamonds all over my teefs
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't, I'm fucked because I live a life of sin
But it's alright, I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight, I'll do what I want
‘Cuz I can

Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

Pictures framing up the past
Your taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle, now a rash

This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one (Fun)

Echoes knockin' on locked doors
All the laughter from before
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory

We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble, tumble, house of cards

I'm gonna burn it down, down, down

My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place
Burn this fucker down
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
