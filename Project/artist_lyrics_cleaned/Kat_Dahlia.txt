I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

My hearts' pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be hallucinatin', I hear it happens
I'm just sayin', babe, I'm just sayin'
Someone give me some paper, someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child, I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say "give me your hand"
Baby, I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

I think I'm in love again

I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

In my dreams, you're the dutch and I'm the duchess
And your blunts are always loose, so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we're getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you to do some crunches
And you say "yeah, well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges"
I say "fuck you" while I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
I think I'm in love
