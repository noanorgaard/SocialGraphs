Helpless, my eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside
You sealed your demise when you took what was mine
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world
No voice to be heard

Waking the demon
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows
Watch the blood flow

There's not much longer, so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
Those painful times, so alone, so ashamed
I'm not coming back; there's nothing to gain

Caution, there's just no limits to the boundaries you push
I've warned you, but still you just fuck with my mind
There's no escape from this rage that I feel

I'm always thinking of you
And all the things that you do
Self-centered satisfaction
No more will I run from you
Dysfunction, family values

Eyes sewn shut so tear them open wide
I'm on the hunt, I'm on the prowl (I can almost taste you now)

Dragged into a world with voices unheard and silent screams
Forced into this hell, where evil compels and shatters your dreams
Trapped in this underworld, confused on how this came to be
The path you walked has lead you on a trail of misery
Unsure of your fate, uncertainty waits, your struggle within

No end and no beginnings
Is this the afterlife?

There's no escape and time is running out
Heaven can wait, come hell or high water

Time's testing your faith, just left there to waste
All hope disappears, so summon the strength

Now break these chains with broken bones, become the enemy
The ends in sight now you're the hunter, show no empathy

Your body's cold
Hope is lost I can't let go
Can I die with you so we can never grow old?
Cut the ties (cut the ties)
With this note you left behind
As I read the words I hear you telling me why

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting, away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong

My sadness shows
As your name is carved in stone
Can't erase the words, so the reality grows
I wish I died (I wish I died)
On that night right by your side (Night right by your side)
So just kill me now and let the good times roll

Sitting here alone with nothing left to say
Staring at the walls won't make them go away
I need to show the world that I'm alive
I have to break this silence, empty out my lungs

I will be heard!
Don't hold me back, don't try to pacify!
This might be hard to hear!

Don't try and heal me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel, feel anything
Don't try and fix me when I'm broken
I need to hurt for me to feel, feel anything

I need a darker place to go and find myself
I don't want to hate or live with my regrets
I have to show I'm strong and I'll survive
I need to break this silence, better mark my words

Now we're playing God
Playing God

No one will stop us, now we're playing God
Thrown out, cast aside
Rejection won't subside
Don't turn the cheek, don't walk away, it's time to decimate
Let's make them hurt and pray
Their turn to run away
Tonight we fight
We make a stand
And dance on shallow graves

We get so complicated (complicated!)
This finger's for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
Light the fire, walk away
There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories
Memories

I want to run and escape from your prison
But when I leave I feel something is missing
I'm not afraid, that's easy to tell
This can't be heaven, it feels like I'm in hell
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking
I want more and I can't stop craving
I still want you, it's easy to see
But guess what, honey, you're not that good for me

Each day will bring us brand new scars

We cannot live like this no more

We could just escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out!), or are we breaking down? (breaking down!)
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever!)

Just keep pushing forward
There's no turning back
There is a tension that hangs in the air
So take a deep breath
There's no time to be scared
Lights out, fist raised!
Adrenaline rushing infecting our veins
Now feel the heat as the temperature spikes
Bodies are thrashing, the fire ignites

We're gonna watch it burn
Let it turn to dust
Behold the madness
Such a beautiful sight
It will never get old
Here's to chaos tonight

Weapons in arms
Army of noise, has come to destroy

We are caught in the eye of the storm
All that's left are just bodies to mourn

Takes you by the hand
Rip this world to pieces
Bid farewell to all you know

So you want to play games with my head?
But you make me fall apart, I wish that I was dead
I just can't believe I fell, for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and used me from the start
Fuck you! (fuck you!), I just want to know the truth
But the words from your mouth they just cloud
All the negativity, forces me down into (silence)
But still I can dream
I want to know
I want to know

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

Now I fucking hate you, with all of my heart
So just disappear, and never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone
And never, no never, will I be unhappy alone

Anarchy will only make it better
We can't, we won't surrender

Don't tell me
Where I will lay in your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Now I'm giving up, I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again

How dare you play the victim?
These tortured eyes, they see right through you

But I hate you, hate you!
