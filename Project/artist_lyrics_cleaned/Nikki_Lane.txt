I know you say you don't wanna leave
But the house just gets so quiet
I lay around and hope you phone me
Won't you sing me to sleep tonight?

Love's on fire
Love's on fire
This traveling round got us burning down
Got us hanging by a wire
Started with a spark but the wind came round
And now our love's on fire
Now our love's on fire

You and me, we got so much love
But we got no money to burn
I'm going away so I can make us something
Sure as the wheels do turn
You might also like
The days and the nights, they just crawl along
It's been a week without a call
Sometimes I wonder if I'm better off alone
Do you think of me at all?

Love's on fire
Love's on fire
This traveling round got us burning down
Got us hanging by a wire
Started with a spark but the wind came round
And now our love's on fire

How could we know
How love was supposed to go
Oh I know, i know it ain't easy
Oh I know, i know it ain't easy

Love's on fire
Love's on fire
This traveling round got us burning down
Got us hanging by a wire
Started with a spark but the wind came round
And now our love's on fire
And now our love's on fire
And now our love's on
