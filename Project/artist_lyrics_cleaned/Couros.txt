We both know
That we're taking the weight of the world
On our own
But we won't work, could it hurt to be held
This ain't love, it ain't freedom
We've got someone to lean on
This ain't love, it ain't reason, when we hurt

All I know is I can breathe a-gain
You help me when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I need
Breathe a-gain
You help when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I need

Hitting rock bottom
It's pretty cold winter, hold something warm

We both know
That we're taking the weight of the world
On our own
But we won't work, could it hurt to be held
This ain't love, it ain't freedom
We've got someone to lean on
This ain't love, it ain't reason, when we hurt

All I know is I can breathe a-gain
You help me when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I need
Breathe a-gain
You help when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I need
Don't need to be that fantasy 
Just some company to remedy how dark the world can get
We won't worry 'bout our timing
So where it's gonna go
Spend it with or without, live for an hour

Honey, we both know
That we're taking the weight of the world
On our own
But it won't work, could it hurt to be hurt
This ain't love, it ain't freedom
We've got someone to lean on
This ain't love, it ain't easy when we hurt

All I know is I can breathe a-gain
You help me when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I need
Breathe a-gain
You help when I need a friend
Breathe a-gain
You help me when I need, help me when I
