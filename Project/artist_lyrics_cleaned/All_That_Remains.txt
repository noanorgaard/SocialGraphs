That I feel nothing
For what's made me the man that you see
What do you think when you look
When you look at me?
Do the pictures make you believe?

From the outside
Stand and judge like enemies
Opened eyes see reality
Trying all the while
To knock me down, this tragedy
And the days turn to memories

I can't believe
How shallow and how dismissive
When I look, I know I see me
No longer see what makes me
What makes me different

Heed failure's lesson

There's no safety
Lest you make your own way

I am the waiting one, it seems
Days grow somber quickly
Now, how the quiet is release
And I feel so lonely

How did you think I would feel?
Throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel?
I won't let you hurt me again

Now I'm nothing to you, I can see

How could they not know, not see
Now broken promise, this legacy
Intent to save, consuming everything before us
Deceived

No remorse, no shame
For the failure
Sold out country, greased palms
For special treatment
Populate the weak mind

When all seems lost, we count the cost
We still remain connected

I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still, I know you'll be long gone
Gnaws and turns as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I

Holding these memories
I feel unfolding

You assume that you're my best friend
No life, just consume what you attach to
Failure, now hang on others
And try to fill the hollow
Pathetic, weak, laughable
You live to follow wantless admiration
Shameless, you dig for status
On your knees, crawl

Validation
Becomes an all-consuming goal
Intruding nature
Demanding one to play the role

You're not worth my time
Ya damn hanger-on
You've got a long way to go
You're still dead wrong

Now dot the map, bring the gifts you offer
As a payment for your audience
Stand up, worship
Bow down to your knees
Entrenched within
A culture that exploits the offers
Relish in the excess
Pathetic, your punishment we must endure

Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day

I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly, I can hear you say:
"Don't leave, don't give up on me"
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember, don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you!
