All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning
The burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall

I've a very strange feeling I never felt before
'Tis a kind of a grind of depression

My heart's acting strangely; it feels rather sore
At least it gives me that impression

My pulses leap madly without any cause
Believe me, I'm telling you truly

I'm gay without pause
Then sad without cause

My spirits are truly unruly
For I'm falling in love with someone
Some one girl
I'm falling in love with someone
Head awhirl!

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone
Plain to see

I'm sure I could love someone madly
If someone would only love me

A little slow, perhaps

Ah!
Enclosed you'll find a small container of the stuff I talk about
Just carefully remove the lid and take a whiff if you've a doubt
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to alert the daily papers
With the news of how our office was affected by your vapours
See Sutton Foster LiveGet tickets as low as $78You might also likeWhich is why I choose to write to you a confidential letter
Full of strong recommendation that you make your floor wax better
I just hope it won't require us to have our floor relaid and
If it does you may expect a bill
Sincerely, Trevor Graydon

Now, read that back to me please

Certainly. "Dear Mr. Hudson," colon:

My eyes are fully open to my awful situation
So I'm writing you a letter to demand an explanation
When the floor wax that we bought from you arrived here Monday morning
We discovered upon usage that the fumes should have a warning
Since the only possibility is that your wax is rancid
I request a full refund of all the money we advanced

Nice!

And unless you can convince me you've improved the floor wax batter
We will take our business elsewhere, so, I hope you solve this matter
Not half bad. Continue please

Miss Dillmount, may I speak frankly?

Yes?

If I could be so lucky as to have a good stenographer
To keep this place as up-to-date as her short skirt and bobbed coiffure
I wouldn't have to worry 'bout our soured office planking
And could concentrate on generating profits ripe for banking
That is why I'm testing you with this outrageous correspondence
Which I don't intend to actually mail to the respondents
So if you can make sense of my unintelligible patter
Then the job is yours and Hudson's Floor Wax really doesn't matter!

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter?
Matter, matter, matter, matter
Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter?
Matter, matter, matter, matter

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!
Matter, matter, matter, matter
Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!
Matter, matter, matter, matter

Now, I want that letter on my desk in two minutes flat. Man your machine! Go!

Time! "Dear Mr. Hudson,"

How much I'll be paid, and
Nice to meet you, I know we'll be friends
Just call me Millie Graydon
