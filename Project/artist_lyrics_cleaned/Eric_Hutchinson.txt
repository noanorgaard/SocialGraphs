Disregard
The lies that he will tell, and what he's probably like, 'cause
It's not hard
His charm is gonna get him through the night

'Cause if he wants to rock, he rocks
If he wants to roll, he rolls
He can roll with the punches
Long as he feels like he's in control, and
If he wants to stay, he stays
If he wants to go, he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there
Long as he gets somewhere he knows, oh no
Ah na na na na, na na na na na na na
Ah na na na na, na na na na na na na

See her, heavy make up and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already, why adjust?
Readin' the magazine secrets
Forgettin' the topical regrets
'Cause if she comes home all alone, the night's a bust
It's a must
The swivel in her hips, and the look she gives
It's all her, trust
If only in the morning she knew where she lived

'Cause if she wants to rock, she rocks
If she want to roll, she rolls
She can roll with the punches
Long as she feels like she's in control, and
If she want to stay, she stays
If she want go, she goes
She doesn't care how she gets there
Long as she gets somewhere she knows, oh no
Ah na na na na, na na na na na na na
Ah na na na na, na na na na na na na

And in a wink, they're on the brink
From drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow
Shot to shot, it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go
All depends, so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance at cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinnin'
Nothing to lose tonight, they both are winnin'
And they fall in love as they fall in bed
They sing

If they wanna rock, they rock
If they wanna roll, they roll
They can roll with the punches
Long as they feel like they're in control
If they wanna stay, they stay
If they wanna go, they go
They don't care how they get there
Long as they get somewhere they know, oh no

If they want to rock, they rock
If they want to roll, they roll
They can roll with the punches
Long as they get somewhere they know
If they wanna stay, they stay
If they wanna go, they go
They don't care how they get there
Long as they get somewhere they know, oh 

When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
She's much too sweet, and she's always gonna be
And when I return to her arms and her eyes
It might not be the same, but it's alright with me

OK, it's alright with me
(It's alright with me)
Some people are scared to see
(Are scared to see)
What's happening frequently
But I would never shy from a fight
Heartbeat with a high demand
(A high demand)
Often will go hand in hand
(Go hand in hand)
But I'm sick of just starting plans
I wanna spend the rest of my life

Some things are just meant to be
It never comes easily
And when it does, I'm already 

Cause I can't stand to be alone
When the buzz starts wearing off

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you

That's me sitting in the bathroom with the lights off
Nobody knows the kind of stuff I gotta to fight off
I wash away my sins but I can't get the white off
What made you think that you could ever take the night off

I can't stand to be alone

You're leaving me between the walls
You fake me out, you say you care
You break me down, I go nowhere
