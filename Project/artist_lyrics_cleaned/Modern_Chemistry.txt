1 ContributorPart Three LyricsIt haunts you in your sleep
So much that you can't even look at me
The places i've gone doubt
The person that i've turned out to be
Oh no
I'm never gonna get this right
Simple thoughts that keep me wrapped up tight
I'll play lost so you can take control
Pull me down but deeper in tonight
No, i'm never gonna get this right
No, i'm never gonna get this right
It's hard to keep in check
The subtle way you look at me, it drags me from my clothes
Oh, the places i've gone doubt
The person I've turned out to be
Oh no
I'm nеver gonna get this right
Simple thoughts that keep mе wrapped up tight
I'll play lost so you can take control
Pull me down but deeper in tonight
No, i'm never gonna get this right
No, i'm never gonna get this right

Words that I still mean?
No, i'm never gonna get this 

I've got a mess of a place to lie my head
Got a few good friends who want me dead
I pile up my sins like dirty clothes
Have an undying passion for being alone
Never again, never again will I falter or break
Cleanse all your sins, tell all your friends
How crazy I am through your lense

I'm never scared, I'm never scared
I swear I'm not, I never am
I'm never scared, I'm never scared
I swear I'm not, I never am
Scared

And it's too much too late to make this right
As I'm watching my helpless body crash into the ocean
In one quick motion
Well I'd rather sink than swim
I've come this far
I'll break another fall with fragile arms
And it's your fault
I've got another scar
But I swear

I'm never scared, I'm never scared
I swear I'm not, I never am
I'm never scared, I'm never scared
I swear I'm not, I never am
Scared

And I can't wait to go
And leave you here alone
'Cause I can't wait to be alone
And I can't wait to go
To leave you here alone
'Cause I can't wait to be alone
I'm never scared, I'm never scared
I swear I'm not, I never
