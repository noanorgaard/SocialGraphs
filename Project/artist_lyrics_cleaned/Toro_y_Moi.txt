Take me far away
'Cause I know my words can be a waste of breath
Space is running low
She thinks I'm guilty of this crime
But I don't think I'll wait to tomorrow
Tomorrow's so far
It seems like a flaw in design
I seek you out and you never seem to have the time
Mirage, so careful now
Too close, you're finding out
Is it me being blind?
Notice that I'm high as a kite
And now I'm pacing too fast to speak
It's me, so fine
I was only looking to be with you now
So take it or leave it, take it or treat it
So high
I dunno why I do this to myself
So high, so high, so high
So high

"Oh hello, I didn't see you 

Too much looking around
I can see how this happens
Using up all the lifelines
Tryna turn out decent
You've got plenty of time
I can see you walked over
What you see isn't in my mind
Don't believe we've met before
I'm acting, playing quiet, smiling, without thought
'Cause my world's been turned inside out
Been gone quite a while

But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

Aren't you gonna stay?
Keep me 'til the sun comes up
Crack a Pellegrino
From the bottle, no cup
That was summer love, that was summer love
Late night, cemetery
Think it's still light out
Temporary love at sight now
Love is scary, baby, look out

No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be 

But even now when they fall into place
I think about you then

I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

Got left surrounded
By my old things
Thought I had moved on (thought I had moved on)
Tried to make ends meet
But picked up a new beat
And so I laid out (and so I laid out)

But even now when they fall into place
I think about 'em then

Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

Love and hold on

Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't 

You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details

What had happened to the time we had?
I thought you said you won't ever
(I know I promised to wait)
Won't ever leave me
(He just means so much more to me than you do)
What happened to us?
(I want– did try
I know, I, I want– did try)

Okay, I’ll take you back
Alright, let’s pick up where we started
Don’t think that’s in my head
I’m not a bit cold-hearted
Save yourself tonight
Tomorrow, I'll get you back
I don't think I have your problem
(I don't think I have your problem)
I don't think I have a problem
I don't think I mean to fuss
I don't want to bother you
And there is no reason to rush
