He'll come after them in the night

No

We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall
I say, we kill the Beast


We're not safe until he's dead

He'll come stalking us at night

Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
You might also like
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So, it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a Beast, he's got fangs
Razor-sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!

No, I won't let you do this

If you're not with us, you're against us
Bring the old man
Get your hands off me

We can't have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out

We'll rid the village of this Beast, who's with me?

I am!

I am!

I am!

Light your torch, mount your horse

Screw your courage to the sticking places
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist, through a wood
Where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a Beast, one as tall as a mountain
We won't rest till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally ho, grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord, and here we go!

We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!

I have to warn the Beast, this is all my fault
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?

Now, now, we'll think of something

We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!

I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up

Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all
Could it be?

Is it she?

Sacré bleu, Invaders!

Encroachers

And they have the mirror

Warn the master
If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them
Who's with me? Ah-ha!

Take whatever booty you can find, but remember
The Beast is mine!

Hearts ablaze, banners high, we go marching into battle
Unafraid, although the danger just increased

Raise the flag, sing a song
Here we come, we're fifty strong
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!

Pardon me, Master

Leave me in peace

But sir, the castle is under attack

Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

This isn't working

Oh Lumière, we must do something

Wait, I know

Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

What shall we do, Master?

It doesn't matter now
Just let them come

Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!
Kill the 

Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor, provincial town

Good morning, Belle

Morning, monsieur

Where are you off to?

The bookshop, I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a-
You might also like
That's nice
Marie, the baguettes, hurry up

Look, there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd

'Cause her head's up on some cloud

No denying, she's a funny girl, that Belle

Bonjour

Good day

How is your family?
Bonjour

Good day

How is your wife?

I need six eggs

That's too expensive

There must be more than this provincial life

Ah, Belle

Good morning, I've come to return the book I borrowed

Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down, have you got anything new?

Ha-ha, not since yesterday

That's all right, I'll borrow this one

That one? But you've read it twice

Well, it's my favorite, far off places, daring sword fights
Magic spells, a prince in disguise
If you like it all that much, it's yours

But, sir—

I insist

Well, thank you, thank you very much

Look, there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Now, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because, you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him till chapter three

Now, it's no wonder that her name means, "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle

Wow, you didn't miss a shot, Gaston
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world

I know

No beast alive stands a chance against you
And no girl, for that matter

It's true, LeFou, and I've got my sights set on that one

Huh, the inventor's daughter?

She's the one, the lucky girl I'm going to marry

But she's—

The most beautiful girl in town

I know, but—

That makes her the best, and don't I deserve the best?

Well, of course, I mean, you do, but—

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said, she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town, there's only she who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there, he goes, isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute
Be still my heart, I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute

Bonjour

Pardon

Good day

Mais oui

You call this bacon?

What lovely grapes

Some cheese

Ten yards

One pound

Excuse me

I'll get the knife

Please let me through

This bread

Those fish

It's stale

They smell

Madame's mistaken

Well, maybe so

Good morning, oh, good morning

There must be more than this provincial life

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife

Look there she goes, the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
But she really is a funny girl
A beauty, but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle (Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour, bonjour,
