Longing somewhere far from home
I need your hand to hold

Will we find a place
To hold us til we're gone
We're on
Pick up the pace until the solace comes

Longing somewhere far from home
I need your hand to hold

Tell me again, it's not the end
Let us pretendYou might also

Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

You have some nerve showing your face here
It had been so long, I thought you disappeared
Why'd you pretend that we’re still so close
When it’s all too clear who you need the most

But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now, so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you’re on

Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

It's been so long since I heard your name
I was losing hope that you felt the same
And it's been so long since I'd seen your face
That, in my own mind, I had been replaced
So won't you just

But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now, so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you’re on

Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

But damn girl, since you come around girl
I need to know right now so won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, I felt the chance that
Maybe you could become my baby
If you just tell me whose side you're 

There is a place
Oh time and space
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to

I can feel the city crumbling around me
Can't seem to find my way
But I can see a bright light calling through the dark night
Hoping I'll find my way

Yeah, I had what I wanted
It went away so fast (fast)
Yeah, got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow (So, here we go)

I can feel the heart beat underneath the concrete
Just like a kick drum plays
Running in a straight line, guided by the streetlights
Pushing the dark away

Yeah, I had what I wanted
It went away so fast (fast)
Yeah, got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No, oh time and space don't exist then
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No, oh time and space...
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
I’ve got to go all the way
I’ve got tomorrow to
