When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

"The can-can's such a pretty show
It'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on Earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong, and it ain't too long
'Fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind, and you soon will find
You're just a boy again"

"When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more, then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way"
Ooh la la!
Ooh la la la la, yeah, hey"

Love is just a game, you know it
And we all like to play
My responsibilities stayed in Paris, tonight I'm gonna play
You got yourself a good girl, so move it, before I get out the way (And he did)

You don't have to buy me drinks. (I'm Uffie, and I shine)
Follow me backstage, right here we're gonna have a good time
We are young and we're hot, we got skills to make us pop
I want you and you want me, so let's not wait to fall in love
Seen a few crazy things with my pretty green eyes
I ain't afraid to talk about how far we're goin' by night
I'm arriving in the club, I get drunk and i get drugs
Faces booming on the sub I lay my vocals on the dub

Now we rock, we don't stop, we drop songs to keep you hot
In the front in the back, watch me get it on like that
I'm the shit, I'm a freak, now everybody get on this
Move your waist and rock your hips, eh
To the Ed Rec hits

Rockin' no stoppin', we're rocking non-stop
We're taking the clock in, rockin' 'round the clock
The substance is on my brain and I gotta do it again
I'm getting late to catch the plane it's not the end of my weekend
Everybody's on my back I've got to do this right
I've got to give them mother fuckers something good tonight
I'm back from tour with my friends, it feels like I never stop
A few hours of sleep and I'm already back on the track
'Cause there is no time to lose
We're rockin' 'round the clock
130 BPM, we think inside the speaker box
Like the Junior Mafia I'm here to get the money
I've got dope beats for my familia, I'm taking your honey
In the club and the hotels, sometimes with my homie
We're getting paid from the club, and we come back with your lady
If you don't like what I keep talking about turn this shit off
We ain't frontin', we're still about what makes you pop that head off
And if you hate it's 'cause you're not hot as the Ed Banger crew
'Cause from Tokyo to Scandanavia they say Ed Banger
