You came to me when I was lonely
And no one cared
You made me see that I was only
Just running scared
I saw your face and something told me
You were the one
You smiled at me and now I see
My life's begun

Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around
Lady
You brought me in from out the rain (Yeah)
Maybe

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way

Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You
