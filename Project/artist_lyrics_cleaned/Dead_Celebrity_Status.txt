Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing
I stay the same while this world keeps changing
I try to run but these walls got me caged in
Is it real or just my imagination?
(Normal)
Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing
I stay the same while this world keeps changing
I try to run but these walls got me caged in
Is it real or just my imagination?
Sometimes I wonder if these walls know my deepest secrets
From who I love, to who I fall asleep with
Can they see my sadness, my raging madness
Or that stack of porno magazines underneath my matress?
Can they hear my breathing, or my footsteps leaving?
Sneaking out my window 'cuz I'm tired of my parents screaming
Louder than Metallica playing with a symphony
Louder than crowds in the eighties screaming for Tiffany
I feel secluded, my thoughts feel polluted
So I escape to music 'cuz I think it's therapuetic, and
This whole world can hate or love me, or think i'm ugly
'cuz unlike my friends these walls won't judge me
These walls won't betray me, these walls are like my safety
But sometimes I feel like these walls drive me crazy
They enslave me or chase me by myself
'cuz if these walls see everything, why the fuck don't they help?
You might also likeIf these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
These walls are my leviathan, my cage, my lion's den
I'm feeling trapped, strapped to this bed that I'm lying in
I can't escape truth so I grab hold of my blanket
Counting the cracks on the ceiling for my own entertainment
And this bordem, it feels like post mortem, shit
I'd rather have my pumpkin smashed by Billy Corgan
'cuz these walls watch me fall asleep and wake up
They've seen my first kiss, they've seen my parents break up
They've seen how I like to make sure my door stays shut
'Cause I like my privacy without it you'd see inside of me
And fall to pieces like clothes with a bad seamstress
These walls are my diary, my notepad, my Jesus
A change of scenery is really all I need
'cuz these walls are closing in and it's hard for me to breathe
It's hard for me to leave but not hard for me to fall
I just don't wanna become another brick in the wall
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing
I stay the same while this world keeps changing
I try to run but these walls got me caged in
Is it real or just my imagination?
Back and forth, forth and back I keep pacing
I stay the same while this world keeps changing
I try to run but these walls got me caged in
Is it real or just my imagination?
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on me
If these walls could talk they'd say
That I was so damn lonely
It feels like no one knows me
These walls keep closing on
