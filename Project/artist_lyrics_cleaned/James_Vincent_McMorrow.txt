My one, my only one
Lies sleeping in the sun
Gave chase and so we run
Nothing breaks your stride like what's become
Oh, oh, oh

Stack, stack the frozen wood next to the shed
Pile it up so high then paint it red
Confuse the dogs, confuse the dogs
And time, time we lost is resting on the stairs
The window out reveals the cooler air
And so we go, and so we go

My one, my only one
Lied twice to keep me on
Gave chase and still we sung
Everything that ends has still begun

From the inside of my mouth
And the slow migration south
And it's not to be denied
It's not to be 

Cause if you're alone, if you're alone
How can I save you?
I find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

I don't want to live without your love
Oh, oh
I tell you what you want to hear if
What you want is incomplete
I don't want to live without your love
I don't mind how much it changes
I can look the other way
I still remember how it felt to be crushed by something
Walk until you see the water
Just in case it disappears

Cause if you're alone, if you're alone
How can I save you?
I find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

And I would just sit in my car
Listening to distant alarms go
They seem far, so far, so
Feeling the weight of the world
Nothing compared to the long road
That seems hard, so hard, so
And I would just sit in my car

That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust

Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope
Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall

Am I an honest man, and true?
Have I been good to you at all?
Oh, I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own

So we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of 

We're in it now, everybody knows
What I've become
Truth is I never once was sad
For what I've done
It's like a game where everybody dies
And has no fun
Still I want to play even if I end
Back where I've begun

Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Because you make me feel alive

It's your lucky day

So write it down
Guess we're gone astray

It wasn't mine

When I wake, realize you were gone
So I sat at the edge of the lawn
Days go by, still no sign of your ghost
Never call, never write, it's a loss
