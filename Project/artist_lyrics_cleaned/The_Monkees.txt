Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave, the less I got

Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings
