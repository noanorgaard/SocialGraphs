Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to Heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command?

I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there

Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?
Follow me into, into my sleep
Baby, I'm yours, I'm yours to keep
You've got the magic that entered my heart and my mind

Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand?
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand?
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand?
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you
