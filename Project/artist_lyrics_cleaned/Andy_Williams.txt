It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus is coming 'round
The Christmas snow is white on the ground
When ol' Santa gets into town
He'll be comin' down the chimney, down
(He'll be comin' down the chimney, down)

It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus has got a toy
For every good girl and good little boy
Santa's a great big bundle of joy
When he's comin' down the chimney, down
(When he's comin' down the chimney, down)

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hangin' on the Christmas tree

And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at twelve o'clock
He'll be comin' down the chimney, down
(He'll be comin' down the chimney, down)

It's the hap-happiest season of all (Ding, dong, ding, dong)
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all (Ding, dong, ding, dong)

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
