I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream I've dreamt about you
And from afar, I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I wouldn't be the same

I'll shine when you shine
Painted pictures on my mind
Sun sets on this ocean
Never once on my devotion
However you are
Or far that you fall
You might also like
I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream I've dreamt about you
And from afar, I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I'd never be the same
Without you
Without 

Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling safely to
The ground
Ah

I'll take this soul
That's inside me now
Like a brand new friend
I'll forever know
I've got this life
And the will to show
I will always be
Better than before
You might also like
Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling safely to
The ground
