Why do you have to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no

A man wants to be approached cool and romantically, oh-oh
I've got needs, I'm just like you
If the conversation's good vibrations through and through, oh-ha

And if I leave, will it end?
Will you need me again?
And if I go, will you love me?
Will you love me when I come back?

I could be what you want me to
Can you hold out and let me do what I want?

Tell me how long could you wait
'Til you move on and tell me that it's too late
