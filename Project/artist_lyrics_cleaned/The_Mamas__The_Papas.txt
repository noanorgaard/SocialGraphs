Stopped in to a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher liked the cold (Preacher liked the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay (Knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day


All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
If I didn't tell her (If I didn't tell her)
I could leave today (I could leave today)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')

Soft rhythms cover me
Soft buckskin next to my feet
Oh, long hair unbound, tumblin' down
Musical songs without sound

Strong magical lights over the land
Strange mystical lines on her hands
Twin Gemini, split in two
Half is for me, half for you

Gemini childe, doot-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo

Gemini childe, woman grown
Lost in a world not her own
My midnight friend, split in two
Half is for me, half for you

Love can never be exactly like we want it to be
I could be satisfied knowing you love me
There's one thing I want you to do especially for me
And it's something that everybody needs

While I'm far away from you, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby
(Yeah) Because it's hard for me, my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn

If there's one thing I want you to do
Especially for me
Then it's something
That everybody needs

Each night before you go to bed, my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby

1 ContributorJust One Night LyricsDon’t be mine forever
Just be mine tonight
Doing what we want
And it feels right
A little empty inside
I’ll work on it but not tonight
We about to take flight
Don’t be mine forever
Just be mine tonight
Don’t over think it
Don’t be uptight
Everything is gonna be alright
Got no time for lames
We gon’ do this all night
Compared to me all y’all saying nada
I’ve got that Authentic Swagger
The rest of y’all knock offs and
People steady hating but I don’t even bother
I just call up my fam’ in Philly
And they pull out that chopper
Me? I just want to be the best
My only goal is success
All y’all lame
Looking for love, me I rather earn this check
All y’all over rated
Y’all leave a brother jaded
I’ma keep it real man
And I ain’t even playin’
I sing to your girl
She is serenaded
She wants to be with me, not you
That must be aggravating
My swag on point, I leave your girl salivating
And I know I said I’d call but
I left your girl waiting
I’m getting money like none of y’all expected
I’m looking back like
“What did you expect kid?”
When I was growing up
Nobody would expect this
But now they see my vision and everybody respect it

I’ll work on it but not tonight
We about to take flight
Don’t be mine forever
Just be mine tonight
Don’t overt think it
Don’t be uptight
Everything is gonna be alright
Got no time for lames
We gon’ do this all night
And she’s loving my lingo
Anybody in my way screaming
“Muevate gringo”
And I’m walking like a pimp cuz
I think I’m El Niño
Mess with me you’ll need a stitch
I ain’t talking about Lelo
Independent making more then your mama and papa
The reincarnation of swag
The black Dali Lama
No disrespect to Buddhists
I just say what I wanna
Getting money and women boy
I’m living nirvana

Bet I’m next up
Everyday I’m dressed up
I could spit this here retarded and
Leave your head all messed up
Everyday I’m swagged out
Matter of fact I’m maxed out
And I ain’t going nowhere
Cuz you know I’ll never tag out
You lost that twinkle in your eye
I’ve got that thrill for life
Best day ever
But I do this every night
I’m on another level
You’ll never reach my height
I’ve just got one request;
Be mine tonight
Don’t be mine forever
Just be mine tonight
Doing what we want
And it feels right
A little empty inside
I’ll work on it but not tonight
We about to take flight
Don’t be mine forever
Just be mine tonight
Don’t overt think it
Don’t be uptight
