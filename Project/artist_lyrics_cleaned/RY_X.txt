Come down, love
Berlin in the cold
All that fighting, all that snow

Sober night
And Byron on my mind
Tell me I'm not going home
And I'll stop waiting by the phone


Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh

Bedroom floor
And silence in my blood
Sorry, love, I'm running home
I'm a child of sun and the stars I loveYou might also
