I believe in miracles
Where you from?
You sexy thing
(Sexy thing, you)
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Miracles right before my eyes
You sexy thing got me hypnotized
Don't stop what ya' doing
What ya' doing to me
My angel from above lying next to me
How did you know I one
Been a long time coming, only just begun
Doing all the things that makes my heart sing
Keep doing what you're doing, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying next to me
Making love to me
You might also like
I believe in miracles
Where you from?
You sexy thing
(You sexy thing, you)
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Only yesterday, I was on my own
Just another day later, my mind was blown
You sexy thing, come into my life
Forever and a day, it feels so right
How did ya' know that I'd be the one
Been a long time coming only just begun
Doing all the things that makes my heart sing
Keep doing what you're doing, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know, every night and day for?
Every day, needing love as satisfaction
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me
I believe in miracles
Where you from?
You sexy thing
(You sexy thing, you)
I believe in miracles
Since you came along
You sexy thing

Oh, kiss me, you sexy thing
Touch me, baby, you sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling, you sexy thing
Oh, it's ecstasy, you sexy thing

Yesterday, I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from?
You sexy thing
(Sexy thing, you)
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing
Oh, touch me
Kiss me, darling
I love the way you hold me, baby
Oh, it's ecstasy
Oh, it's ecstasy (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Kiss me, baby (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
I love the way you kiss me, darling (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Oh, yeah (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Love the way you hold me (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Keep on lovin' me, darling (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Keep on lovin' me, baby (Sexy thing, you sexy thing, you)
Ah, ah, ah-ha,
