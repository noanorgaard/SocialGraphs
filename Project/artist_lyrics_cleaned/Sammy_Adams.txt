(I just took it)
Still haven’t told them where I put it
(where I put it now)
Offers came through, No this ain't new
My agents double that and book it
Anyway, they MIA
But the juice on the trilly now
Tell the truth used to hate it but you feel me now
Here me steppin on the sidewalk, knockin pavement
I can’t, I can’t get involved if there ain't no payment
So you can be the judge yeah
And the defense and the jury and plaintiff
Cuz I could give fuck yeah
I could give a fuck less

But you try prove
Or if you tryin to make it
Do what you do
I know I don’t do basic
Good bye to slow money
Hello to show money

Fuck I don’t know where to put it
Both kinds, on the way
But the crib look silly now

Competition on blaze through the city now
(Through the city now)
Here me floatin down the west side
Chopper dangerous
I been ridin on the cost since I born in Cambridge
They say pesos me
More fades, more X,Y,Z
So I could really give a fuck less

Let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
I've got a friend that's just your type
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night
It takes three to make it all count
You and me and her should get down
So let me show you what I like
Let's have a helluva night, yeah
A helluva night

One is company, two's a crowd, three's a party if it all goes down
Yup, bring a friend, you could both get plowed
Both-both find out how I look down south
I'm what they don't make no more
Your friend's the one I saw on Facebook, though
Gotta make sure her cake looks swole, as I'm pulling up her page, how her face look?
Ohhhh she a savage
Look bad as fuck and she practice
So whatever you down with your mouth, yeah, as she bounces,  it's fantastic
Role play, wanna touch on ya
We can both pay like a customer
She and her fuck in the cuffs and thongs
One, two, three, ménage à trois

Don't know how I got on top of ya
I ain't really into being popular
She told me, "I can really see the star in ya. I can see it from afar like binoculars."
I said, "Don't know if you've heard of this. If you'd even come close to deserving this."
But your friend's my type
I know you like everything that I'm saying so let's go tonight
Gotta x those plans
Under 21?
Gotta x those hands
Master chief, but I've got master plans, in the master bedroom, I'm a master man
Master man, move fast 'round here
And he can't match?
Well I just don't care
So raise your glass, tap an ass, got a pass 'round here
2 girls, 1 guy: that's a fact right there
 X2
This could be perfect, let's run around
Meet up with one of your friends, I would be down
Worth it, if you're in town
Got a voicemail said, "don't back out, don't don't don't back out."

Let me show you what I like

Baby, you been driving me crazy
Can you be my lady?
Can you be my baby, baby?
Driving me crazy

I’m walking on, walking on broken glass
Got a problem too many girls in class (yeah)
Wanna run a show but they just can't wrap (no)
The idea around they head that the kid could rap
Fact, I kill stages all places
Nantucket and ACK city so they could taste it
But I’m real late no way Imma make it
Back to my classes, the clock impatient (I’m back)
Well, apologize to the teacher for me
Cause anything she speaks ain’t doing shit for me (ain’t nothing)
And my bad can't read notes
Still amazing like a chick with a deep throat
Treading water since the very thin ice broke
Now I’m neck deep in contracts
Psycho (yeah) I’m alright though, or I will be
Shake your ass ma, if you feel me

I'm not trying to show you love and affection (Oh, no way)
I'm trying to live the life a kid always expected (That's good)
Over on Sunset, finished a couple sessions
One foot in the door, one in the hills, questions? (Question?)
Angels in leather, I ain't talking 'bout the motor club
But I tend to go hella hard when I go to clubs
Minibar murder, I'm on Denzel's flight
With a stewardess that wants to fuck the whole damn night
Who cares what they all say
Try'na find some girls like Hov did with Beyonce (Hov)
Had you for a week but I heard you say fiance
Na na, none of that girl

I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home
And she said, and she said, uh

Maxing out all my credit cards
Living my own L.A. story
Living it up 'til the morning
We'll be taking shots under the stars
Living off of hotel minibars

Living it up, living it up
We living it up

Everybody's a model or a wannabe
If you're that bad, isn't Paris where you ought'a be?
She's an actress, working on the late shift (Late shift)
Only longs for a big break as a waitress (Waitress)
Walk the strip, see the fashion getting wacky now
Out the door, passing out
Hit the floor, Pacquiao
Credit card at the bar never closing out
But the weather's so nice, nobody slowing down (Always)
Well, except for the 101
Gotta SUV stuck in traffic with a ton of buds
I can promise you tonight's gon' be a ton of fun
Know that c-c-c-c
'Cause I fell in love, the streets got a glow

Up at Urth Caffe like Vinny Chase
She got a big booty, itty bitty skinny waist
Henny straight, every day summer
Never on the sheets like you're on top of the cover
Every day when I'm away look at the toe so
Look at the cops, don't even care, you can just blow smoke
Uh, I'm Robin Hood on the beat
I get paid in L.A. and give it back to the D
I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home
And she said, and she said, uh

Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger
I wanna go all night longer
A couple rounds going down like water
I wanna go all night longer
Cause I do this every night

Hoppin' up out of that Lotus lookin' focused
Everywhere we get noticed cause they know us
Tell the promoters send more gin and soda
If you know me you know I'm never sober
You know this body aroma I'm a stoner
Crumblin' marijuana on your sofa
Watchin the bentley 
I wanna, uh, get to know ya bring you closer
Threw a concert on the highway
Woke up in somebody's driveway
Take a hit to get rid of the migrane
We do it again like it's Friday
Turn this motherfucker sideways
Turn this motherfucker sideways
Came to Vegas for the weekend, but
The after-party last for five days

Whisky straight for the lonlies
Tequlias, red whine and Stoli's
Yeah I mix it, yeah I mix it
Have some beers before this liquor
Now I'm shit-faced at the bar but my games never been sicker
Shoot whiskey like a cowboy
Both guns go off then we wild boys
Got a light skinned girl, sip tall boys
Jump around get loud make some mad noise
Gun natty ice like a college kid
So many girls, come and grab one bitch
Toast to the bars, toast to the broads
Ha! no wonder why you love this shit!
