You're my Coney Island baby, you're so precious, so sweet
Since the day I met you, my life has been complete
You're my everything, soon you'll wear my ring
You're my girl

Just the two of us here on a blanket of love
Writing love letters in the sand
As long as there's sand and as long as there's the sea
You'll be my Coney Island baby

Oh, you're my Coney Island baby, don't ever let me down
You're my pretty little lady, feel like I'm wearing a crown
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go
You're my Coney Island baby, I love you, I love you so

You're my Coney Island baby, I want you, I want you to know
You're my Coney Island baby, I love you, I love you so
