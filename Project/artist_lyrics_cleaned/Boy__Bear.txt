But I'm so damn cold
And if this blood don't turn to gold, I think I'm doomed
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

The time has come, my friend, to run
I bid you, please, to take the roses
An the loaded gun I left you
'Cause I'm hopin' now you find somehow

That I'm so damn cold
And if this blood don't turn to gold, I think I'm doomed
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah!
