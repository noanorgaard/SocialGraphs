Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe
And a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Made the children smile they say
And were they surprised
When he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat, they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
You might also like
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe
And a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
And were they surprised
When he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day

(But Uncle Jimmy, you didn't finish your story.)
I know, I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well, he got in a lot of trouble, you see?

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away."
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
And around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can!"
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, "Stop!"
(No!)

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' "Don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!"

Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Over the hills and
