The smartest men, they saw a world with
Corners and endings far, far, far away
But when they drew it out and searched it
They were a long way, were a long way, were a long way
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way

Hm-m-m-m
Hm-m-m-m
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way off

The erudite composed a thesis
Everything we see is all, all, all there is
But as an apophatic mystic
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way off

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way
We’re a long way, ?with always?, we're a long way
We’re a long way, we’re a long way, we’re a long way off

When the waves of time
Wash the shores stark clean
Of the memories, the last of me
With my castles gone to the constant sea
Will you stay with me
Stay with
