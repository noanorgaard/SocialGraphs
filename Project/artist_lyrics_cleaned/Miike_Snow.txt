I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me

And the lights, they glow
Like I've just lost the World War
And the scene slips away
To the evenness I fake
It's a shit old world
'Cause I don't really want you, girl
But you can't be free
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm obscene

Girl, you say you want it
And I have no trips about it
And these played-out faces around me
Want you to know where they go
But they ain't got nothing on you
To say "ah" and open your mouth for me
I've got you locked down like police
No three-to-five, you're doing life, so

Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

These noisy voices, phony
They say I'm not really for you
Cause I slept around before you
And I had fun, but now I am done
So put your arms around me
And I'll put away the snowflakes
And you'll be my only, only
And no three-to-five, you're doing life, so

Wild hungry arms
Wild hungry arms
Gimme all of the love I need

After a while I fanned the fire
Then I knew that you were wild
I think that the time is now
I think that the time is now, so

Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you

You say isn't it hard paddling out?
Paddling out?
You say isn't it hard paddling out?
Paddling out?

The rattle and the mating crowds
Are out here for the weekend
We had to take our clothes before
The sun was gone completely
I used to lie and think in clouds
Deciding which were queens and which were doves
And lines I throw myself are thin
Are shower-curtand thin
