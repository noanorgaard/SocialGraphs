When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
Drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops
Drops, drops, drops, drops
Bassline drops (Get that)

A-a-a-and it's that for no reason!
 my style!

Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
When the bassline drops, when the bassline drops
Drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops, drops
Drops, drops, drops, drops
Bassline drops (Get that)
