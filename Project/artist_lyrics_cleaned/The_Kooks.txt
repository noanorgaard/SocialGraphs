Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

And at the show on Tuesday, she was in her mindset
Tempered furs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving, make me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey, yeah
So won't you go far, tell me you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause
And you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

I have a secret I need to tell you
Exquisite visions fill up my mind

Do you remember me taking pictures of you
As the light came through?
You were running away
And I asked you for a place to stay
Do you remember me taking pictures of you?
Taking pictures of you

We live in such extraordinary times
Exquisite visions fill up my mind

Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh, go to Hollywood
And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not to pretend I know you, girl
