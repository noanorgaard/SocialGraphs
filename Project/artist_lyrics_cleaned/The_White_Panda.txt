My people used to say where the rappers at?
They don't know what he sayin' what the hell he rappin'?
Got the law like Moses and Im back from mountain
Write it on the tablet so you don't forget it
Poetic stories from africa-by the fire side
The fighters die, black spot on cheetahs make them cry
I bet I was with Diana before she had the might
We had the mic before Mike Tys dey badbite
Backbite people don't turn face to win the fight
But Im the rap-cop, I put yall behind my bars
Bahamas, even monkeys don't deny bananas
Peeled its back on work work Drake's Rihanas'
2015 I drive through the forest hills
Apparently, Im a shy guy in China
Im a black and white panda, desiiigner
Sounds we future, we got broads in Atlanta
My guy

We've been in the dark too long we bouta On the Light
They sayin' we leftys when they know we kickin' right
Serve you with the rap on plate, I know you satisfied

You make I remember the first time I hold a mic
Me and my brothers used to argue 'bout who's got the lines
In my momma's kitchen-cook,cookery that was meant to be
But we couldn't finish what we started so we couldn't eat
Look what you made me do
Look what the jungle in you made me prove
Look what the struggles in you made me choose
Long live the king, no idols, no time, no games, no rival, I accept the jungle
Remember no rains in the wilderness, I give you caution
And if the pastures greener in my field I give you portion, cause
