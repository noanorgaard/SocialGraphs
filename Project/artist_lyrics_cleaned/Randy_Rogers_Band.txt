Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Let's strip away everything
Tonight there's nothing getting in our way
The ties that bind, the wheres and whys
Take em off and leave them all outside
Lock it all outside

Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark

Baby, we can say so much
Reveal everything with just one touch

Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss me in the dark,
