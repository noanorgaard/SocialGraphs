We're leaving together, but still, it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back to Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (Leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown
The final countdown

Oh-oh, we're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still, we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all, yeah
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (To be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (Final countdown)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ohh

The final countdown, oh, oh
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (Final countdown)

Oh, it's the final countdown
We're leaving together (The final countdown)
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown (Final countdown), oh
It's the final countdown


Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie
Things they change, my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere again

I read your mind
With no intentions
Of being unkind
I wish I could explain
It all takes time
A whole lot of patience
If it's a crime
How come I feel no pain?

Oh, somewhere again
