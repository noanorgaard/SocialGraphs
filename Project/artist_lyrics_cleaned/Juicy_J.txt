Yea, I tell you one time, don't play with my bread
Nigga, you do, they gon' find yo ass dead
Body in trunk, hands tied to yo legs
Tape on yo mouth, a hole in yo head
Fronted some dope, now the nigga in debt
How you gon' pay that? Nigga don't sweat
Goons on deck - you know what's next
Send 'em to yo house, now it's time to collect
Now you in a box, nigga - cause and effect
Hollow points and buckshots all in yo neck
Told ya 'bout playin' with a nigga like that
Now yo fam gon' visit you, payin' they respects
Tell ya one time, don't play with my money
Sold all my dope, now you run around stuntin'
All in the mall, spendin' money on ya woman
Nigga must think he don't owe me nothin'
Nigga must think I forgot about mine
He pressed 'ignore' when I called his line
I'ma play it cool like everythin' fine
Catch him comin' home, lay him down with the 9

Very fatal, dippin' in my stash like a soup ladle
Rolled up on him, shot him in his head, busted tomato
You niggas get high on this shit, like to hold ya' nuts
Shotgun blast to ya stomach, bitch, hold ya guts
You say you gang affiliated, extra clips tough
And when the bullets get to poppin', they don't give no fucks

Kidnap ya from ya residence, no mask no lie
F.B.I. found ya body in Project dumpster,

And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hatin' on me
On me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doin' somethin' right
And if their mamas know my name
And if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
And just 'cause she loves me, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band, ooh, yeah
I love the guitars
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, no, she can't feel her knees, oh

No support everybody thought we never be shit
Tryna start our own label on some Master P shit
Tryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us
Doors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up
Still on the grind, still on the rise
Even had to sell my whip to pay for studio time
Made a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame
Now they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane
Tryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets
Had a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'
They ain't hold us down, did it on our own
With our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall
Then the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up
People started switching up, we still not giving up
I love them though, we been through it all
They're my brothers though, now that's some real shit
We weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss
Hustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks
From the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip

Droppin racks off one plate
Took her to the strip then blew it
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds
