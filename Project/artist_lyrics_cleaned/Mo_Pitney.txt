Everywhere
Every step
Every sunrise, every sunset
Every word I say
Every night and day
Every single move
Everything I do
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere

As I walk through this life, on my left and on my right
Even when I cast an eye in my rear view
I feel you ever close in the whisper of the road
This journey unfolds, I see you
You might also like
Everywhere
Every step
Every sunrise, every sunset
Every word I say
Every night and day
Every single move
Everything I do
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere

In the sunshine
When the rain pours
In this heart of mine
I know you're
Everywhere

Everywhere
Every step
Every sunrise, every sunset
Everything I see
Every ounce of me
Every breath of air
In turn every prayer
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
