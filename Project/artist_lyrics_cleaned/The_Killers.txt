But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy, easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turnin'
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet

Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness; watch it now, here he comes

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Lookin' for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well

I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

You got to know that this is real, baby, why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good
We can't wait till tomorrow

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby, are you lonesome now?

At night, I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl, but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you wanna hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
