The bigger they are the harder they fall
Giants they die
Just walk around the Jericho wall
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Let God arise, giants die
Giants do die
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Giants they die
Just walk around the Jericho wall
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Let God arise, giants die
Your praise will bring down strong holds
When you pray, you will see miracles
Just pray when things seem impossible
And the King of Glory will show his glory
Let God arise, giants die
Giants do die
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Giants they die
Just walk around the Jericho wall
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Now we come in Your name and we stand on Your word
What is loose in the heavens will be loose on earth
Let God arise, giants die
When you praise, when you praise
When you praise they gotta come down
When you praise, when you praise
When you praise they gotta come down
When you worship, when you worship
When you worship they gotta come down
When you worship, when you worship
When you worship they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
When you shout, just shout
When you shout they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
They gotta come down, they gotta come down
Let God arise, giants dieYou might also
