You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

You kiss and you kiss and you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round, I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round, I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience impatiently
Circling (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye, but I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I've never had to lie

It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else

I was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the

Who knows what's right? The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (Oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)

I'm sorry, brother
I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine
No, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train
Just by the side of Amsterdam

Just by the side of the Tin Man

It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I keep coming up short

"Congratulations, you are all alone"

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls they're crashin' down
No, I won't wait much longer

While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
