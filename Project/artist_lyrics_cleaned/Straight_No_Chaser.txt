1 ContributorChristmas (Baby Please Come Home) Lyrics(Christmas) The snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) Lots of people around
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) All ringing in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
They're singing "Deck the Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year, yeah
(Christmas) Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
(Christmas) You should be here with me
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
I need you right here with me
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
They're singing "Deck the halls"
But it don't feel like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last , yeah

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I need you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
To warm a lonely night
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby
Don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you
Let me love you
(Just let me love, let me love you)
Just let me love you

1 ContributorChristmas Wish LyricsWhen the leaves start to blow
And the rain turns to snow
It is always the time of year I adore
But I know what I've missed
When I make up my list
There is only one thing I'm asking for
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(All I want for Christmas)
Find a girl for me, so I won't be alone
(Don't wanna be alone)
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(She's all I want for Christmas)
Please find a girl who I can call my own
(Find a girl I can call my own)
Everyday she'd be near me
And when I'd sing, she'd always hear me
We'd walk together in the snow
Humming the carols we both know
I'd give her everything inside my heart
(Give her my heart)
I want someone I can love for Christmas
(All I want for Christmas)
Find a girl for me, so I won't be alone
I don't wanna be
(Don't wanna be alone)
I want someone I can love for Christmas

1 ContributorLittle Saint Nick LyricsOoh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
Ooh, ooh
Well, a way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four-speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

1 ContributorThe Christmas Song LyricsChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
