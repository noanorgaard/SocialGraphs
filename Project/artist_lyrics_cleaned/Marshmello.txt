I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been silent for too long

I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long

I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello

It's like 4 am and I'm bored again
When that 40 end
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench
I just step back, lemme soak it in
I've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win
It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
I'm fine, I'm high
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Focused on that one mistake, let it free, don't let it break
Fuck it all, I'm turning in
My celly's off, the great escape

Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
