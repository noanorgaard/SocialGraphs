Yo, I think Yule snapped
Oh my God, she the queen of the trap
She's so dope, all them girls fall back
I think all of them dudes wanna mack
Pop two, pop three, pop four
I'm so turnt, but I'm 'bout to pop more
Lowkey, I get booty like a chair
She say I'm basic, I said, "Girl, where?"
You can't even really dance, girl
You spillin' out them pants, girl
I'm chillin' out in France, girl
I'm about to take your man, girl
Look at all my exes
Some of them is from Texas
And they keep sendin' these sexts
But I'm steady movin' on to the next
'Cause this pic I took is fire, my selfie 'bout to drop
Put that money in my bag and I'll make the world stop
You might also like
I only like baddies, your new girl lookin' rattie
I be poppin' in that 'Rari while you basic in that Caddy
'Cause I lowkey flex, l-l-lowkey flex
You keep frontin' like you 'bout it, I just lowkey flex

All, all, all this money
All these girls lookin' at me funny
Your man in my 'Rari
And I'm really, really, really not sorry
I be poppin' and poppin' my bags like a seizure
Flow so cold you could find me in the freezer
Pretty face, b-b-big butt
Yeah, I know you wanna squeeze her
Oh, God, I'm too lit
Now you know I'm way too lit
If these haters keep on talkin', now these haters gon' get hit
Now I got more cheese than a Domino's
And I really don't mess with you ugly bo's
Got a big ol' booty like Amber Rose
Stretchin' out these pantyhose
Girl, you lookin' dusty, all you do is flop
Put that money in my bag and I'll make the world stop

I only like baddies, your new girl lookin' rattie
I be poppin' in that 'Rari while you basic in that Caddy
'Cause I lowkey flex, l-l-lowkey flex
You keep frontin' like you 'bout it, I just lowkey
