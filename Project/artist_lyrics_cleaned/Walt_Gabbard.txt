Got to the marsh at a quarter 'til three
Eight other rigs, and we're in the lead
Been scoutin' that hole for about two weeks

Gonna wait 'til they drop from the heavens just right
Me and my buddies and my dog at my side
I love livin' life with my eyes to the sky
With my eyes to the sky

That Mossy Oak Duck Blind blends right in
By the time they see it, it's a sin
Shoot where they're goin' not where they've been
I've got twelve ducks with that green paint job
Six more circling right on top
I love livin' life with my eyes to the sky

When the day is done, we'll wait for the sun
When it comes we'll load our guns
Live our lives with our eyes to the sky
With my eyes to the sky

I've got my finger on the trigger, shells in the gun
Flip off the safety let's have some fun
Send the dog man watch her run
That steam rolling from the top of the blind
Fresh duck cut up tastes just right
I love livin' life with my eyes to the sky

When the day is done, we'll wait for the sun
When it comes we'll load our guns

With my eyes to the sky

Left the marsh at half past nine
Eight other rigs still wasting their time
Boat load of green shining in the sunshine
With tomorrow morning weighing on my mind
Weighin' on my
