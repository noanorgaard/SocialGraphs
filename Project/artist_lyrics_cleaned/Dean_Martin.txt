Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then, how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it'll be Christmas Day

(Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene)
And above all this bustle you hear

(Silver bells) Silver bells, (Silver bells) silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it'll be Christmas Day

Man, it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought me some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dyin'
And, my dear, we're still goodbyein'
But as long as you'd love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
