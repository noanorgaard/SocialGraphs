Yo, I woke up late
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
No need for a shave, I don't need to be fly
But my girlfriend styley (yeah), I'm stepping outside
Such a wonderful sight, not a cloud in the sky
In love with the landscape, she said, "What's the plan, babe?"
I thought for a second, smoked salmon and some pancakes
Start with the flat white, make mine a double shot
Mid afternoon, might swing by the bottle shop
Grab a six pack, layin' in the park (yeah)
Blazed as the daylight fades into dark
See an old man walking his dog, not hurrying
At all like he doesn't have a worry in the world
And as I sit back puffing my trees
I think to myself how lucky I be
I'm the luckiest son of the best mother that ever lived (yeah)
Yo, it doesn't get much better than this

I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday morning
So, I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday morning
"Yeah"
"Yeah"
"I believe"
We keep it easy like Morgs on the beats
We keep it easy like chop another bowl
We keep it easy like chilling by the beach
We keep it easy like going for a stroll
We keep it easy like Lionel Richie
We keep it easy like Faith No More
We keep it easy like Eazy-E did, and
We keep it easy like Snoop Doggy Dogg

I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday mornin'
So, I'ma chill, forget about the Monday morn'
Till it comes I'ma stay ballin'
We keep it easy like a Sunday
