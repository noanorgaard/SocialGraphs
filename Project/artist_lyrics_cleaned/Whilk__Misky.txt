It's just the two bridges
(Standing in my way)
Standing in my way, way, way

It's just the two bridges
Standing in my way, way, way
And the deep dark river
Is picking up its pace, pace, pace
And though I'm a swimmer
I've been floating in the wake, wake, wake
With all of these sinners
Yeah, I just wanna play, play, play

It's just the two bridges
Standing in my way, way, way
Is picking up its pace, pace, pace
Yes, we all got issues
And we don't wanna know, know, know
Yes, we all need comfort
But we don't wanna show, show, show
So feel those twitches
Starting from your toes, toes, toes
And you'll find you're forgetting
As the dancing fills your soul, soul, soulYou might also 

Oh she's my rain in the desert
She's my sun in the storm
She's my food when I'm hungry
She's my rose amongst the thorns
She's my glue when I'm broken
She's my warmth when I'm cold
She's my breath when I'm choking
She's my bio when I'm soaked
But I want cream in my coffee
I want springs in my steps
I want gin in my tonic
And I want all that I can get
I want freedom as I run
And I want wind in my fire
And I want bullets in my gun
To do whatever I desire

When I saw her there with a flower in her hair
Amongst the roses (amongst the roses)
Yes she struck me down, made me scared, made me run
From her loving (from her loving)
Just I didn't understand the power in her hands
As they touched me (as they touched me)
I got hypnotized by her voice and her eyes
Oh babe, I'm yours, oh babe I'm yours

Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours

I'm gonna live for the moment
And want her plenty for her head
With my hands in my pockets and the words in my head
Spelling out the answers through the crystals left unsaid
Don't analyse the problems through the steps that I tripped

When I saw her there with a flower in her hair
Amongst the roses (amongst the roses)
Yes she struck me down, made me scared, made me run
From her loving (from her loving)
Cause I didn't understand the power in her hands
As they touched me (as they touched me)
I got hypnotized by her voice and her eyes
Oh babe, I'm yours, oh babe I'm yours

Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm yours
Oh babe I'm 

So clap your hands
Steal the moment as you shake and prance
Feel that lovin' as you twist and dance
Make the most of this chance, mmmm
And stomp your feet
Feel the thump of the ground underneath
Steal the heart of the sound and the beat
Feel the love and romance, mmmm

Feelin', feelin' dreamy
As I float along the waves
And I'm smilin' at these dreams again
Yeah, I'm feelin' these dreams
You might also likeFeel these dreams again, takin' hold
Put myself in your control
Lose all feels, lose yourself
To the moment, to no one else
Trust me now, let it out
Free your soul, you know how
In the dark or in the light
We merge our hearts, day or
