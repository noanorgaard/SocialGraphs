When you were a vixen and I was a chump
You looked at me like I crawled from a swamp
Now things have a different complexion
I'm the object of your affection
Much as I don't doubt your expertise
Find yourself another hunk to squeeze

'Cause it's too late to come fishing
Yes it's too late to come fishing
Well it's too late, and the fish don't like your bait
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home

I know I had the flair, the clothes
Made you look right down your nose
But now you want to make a new start
Oh I'm so touched by your change of heart
But my diary's fit to overflow
Find yourself some other gigolo

'Cause it's too late to come fishing
Yes it's too late to come fishing
Well it's too late, the fish don't like your bait
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home
See Richard Thompson LiveGet tickets as low as $478You might also like
Well I've seen your work in that TV sketch
Playing poison women is hardly a stretch
And you were typecast as a Stone Age charmer
In that Darwin docudrama
I'd say our time has all but disappeared
Just like the shine on your fabulous career

'Cause it's too late to come fishing
Yes it's too late to come fishing
Well it's too late, the fish don't like your bait
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way home
Tin Pan Ellie better find your way
