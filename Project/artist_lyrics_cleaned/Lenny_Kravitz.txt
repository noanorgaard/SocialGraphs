Don't come hanging around my door
I don't want to see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growing old with you

Now woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama, let me be

Don't come knocking around my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, said get away
American woman, listen what I say

Don't come hanging around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

I gotta go, I gotta get away
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
A-bye-bye, a-bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye
(American woman) You're no good for me and I'm no good for you
(American woman) I look you right straight in the eye and tell you what I'm gonna do
(American woman) I'm going to leave you, woman, you know I got to go
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, I got to go
(American woman) I got to go
I gotta go, American woman, 

I was born long ago
I am the chosen, I'm the one
I have come to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid, I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

But what I really want to know is
Are you gonna go my way?
And I got to, got to know

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

C'mon

Are you gonna go my way?
Because baby I got to know, 

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over

How many times
Did we give up?
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive

All of my life
Where have you been?
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown, never

All of my life
Where have you been?
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win

Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
