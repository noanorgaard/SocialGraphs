When you ask me my opinion
I'm always sure to be your minion
Girl, you're kinda like long division
Everything is difficult

Help me help you
Girl what you trying to do?
'Cause I don't got a clue
No, I ain't no Scooby Doo
Help me help you
'Cause I'm hungrier than you
I just wanna get some food
And you about to kill my mood
Help me help you
"Do these jeans make me look fat?"
Yeah, I know you want the answer
But I'm smart and that's a trap
Help me help you
Oh, and here's a random fact
You still got my favorite hoodie
And you need to give it back
You might also like
It ain't that I ain't calling back
It's just you said you needed space
And so I'm staying out your way
It ain't that I ain't got your back
But you went out of your way to make that "k" a lowercase

Baby girl, when I ask you if there's a problem
Don't tell me you're fine, I know you're not fine
I just don't understand you, you'd steal the covers and then you want me to cuddle you, are you hot or are you cold?
Don't ask me if I think another girl is cute, that's a loaded question
What are you trying to do?
What are you trying to make me, girl?
We're on the same team, so just please
Just listen to me and hear what I have to say, baby girl
Help me help
