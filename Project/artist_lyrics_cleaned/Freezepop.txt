The music is loud, the kids are so young
All over the world, they want to have fun
The music is so loud, it drowns out the talk
All over the world, just give us more rock
The music is loud, the night is so young
All over the world, we want to have fun
The music gets louder, please don't call the cops!
All over the world, we just want to rock

The kitchen scene is damp and sticky
They're lined up at the keg of PBR
We're yelling conversations
Through the floor you hear the keyboards and guitar
I'm getting kind of antsy
I just came up here to get some air
This isn't where the music's at
I guess I'm going back down there

The basement scene is hot and sweaty
Bodies packed from wall to wall
The band are tearing through their set
The encore is the best of all
Let's keep this party going, yo
We've got nowhere else to be
Someone yells, "less talk more rokk"
Mostly unironically


We just want to rock
We just want to rock
We just want to rock
We just want to
