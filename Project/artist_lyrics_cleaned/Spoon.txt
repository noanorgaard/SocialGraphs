And that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
Aw, that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by

We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to "Some Weird Sin"
We seek out the taciturn

And that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
Aw, that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
Well, that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by, it's the way
And that's the way we get by
That's the way we get by

We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Tried it out, it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said, "Let's make a new start"

And that's the way to my heart
It's the way to my heart
And that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
And that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by, it's the way
Well, that's the way we get by
That's the way we get by

We get high in backseats of cars
We put faith in our concerns
Fall in love to "Down on the Street"
We believe in the sum of ourselves, I said

That's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
Aw, that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by
And that's the way we get by
It's the way we get by, it's the way
And that's the way we get by
That's the way we get 

I want to forget how convention fits
But can I get out from under it?
Can I get it out of me? Oh, oh, oh
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
Can't let go of it, uh-huh

'Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know
You will not back up an inch ever
That's why you will not survive
Yeah!

The thing that I tell you now
It may not go over well
And it may not be photo-op
In the way that I spell it out

But you won't hear from the messenger
Don't wanna know 'bout something that you don't understand
You got no fear of the underdog
That's why you will not survive


Blow out that cherry bomb for me
We lost it long ago
You and me

Now you know your way
Back from the spirit bar
Brush your teeth for bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

Blow out that cherry bomb for me
You got to know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve (Come on, come on)

It was the longest day that I'd ever known
I watched you start that drive alone
You might also like
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
It's going to burn right up your sleeve
Burn right up your sleeve

So there you go again
Out in your dressing gown
Get yourself to bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

Oh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on
I could pay to that hand on your cherry bomb
Oh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on
I could pay to that hand on your cherry
