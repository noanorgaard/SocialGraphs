And I don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know if you are less than lonely
Don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know, don't want to know

The day you left me, left me feeling oh so bad
Baby, I'm not sure about all the doubts we had
From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last
Decisions have been made, the die has been cast

And I-
I don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know if you are less than lonely
Don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know, don't want to know

Don't want to know, don't want to know

The phone is ringing and the clock says four A.M
If it's your friends, well, I don't want to hear from them
Please leave your number and a message at the tone
Or you can just go on and leave me alone

But I-
I don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know if you are less than lonely
Don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know, don't want to know
I don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to know if you are less than lonely
Don't want to know if you are lonely
Don't want to
