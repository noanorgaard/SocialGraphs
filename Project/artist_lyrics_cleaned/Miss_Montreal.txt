I'm feeling lost standing still, my back against the wall
We've built it up over time, I don't know who you are
I'm tired of holding it up, I gotta watch it fall
Run away, find a way without you

I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you
But I can't fight anymore
I have tried for so long
It's hard to care when it's gone

I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you

It's not that I don't or I have never felt
It's just that you taught me how to live without
I'm not afraid to face it all by myself
Run away, find a way without you

I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you
But I can't fight anymore
I have tried for so long
It's hard to care when it's gone

I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you

This is not easy for me
But this is what I need
This is goodbye

I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you
But I can't fight anymore
I have tried for so long
It's hard to care when it's gone
I'm giving up on—
I know you want me to fight
I know you want me to try
I know you want me to care about you
But I can't fight anymore
I have tried for so long
It's hard to care when it's gone

I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on you
I'm giving up on
