And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow, I'm going to be by your side"

You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever, I will be by your side"

Long as I have you

Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall

Strange, beautiful, grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains, I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?

"Strange, beautiful...
Grass of green...
With your majestic silver seas...
Your mysterious mountains...
I'd wish to see...
May I land my kinky machine?"

Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your people, I do not understand
So to you, I shall put an end
Then, you'll – never hear Surf Music again
