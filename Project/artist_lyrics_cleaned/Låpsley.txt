One month till February
Keep on holdin' on
And I know it's short
And I know it's short
One month till February
Keep on holdin' on
And I know it's short
And I know it's short

And it's times like these
And it's days like these
And it's times like these
And it's days like

It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short
It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short

Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
( Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this)
You might also like
And it's times like these
And it's days like these
(Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this)
And it's times like these
And it's days like

It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short
(Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this)
It's been a long time comin'
But I'm falling short
(Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this
Not too far to carry this
Not too far to carry )

Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
Heart to higher shelf
(Not too far to carry this)
Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
One month till February
And this is how I feel
Because you took something away from yourself
Come back to this route and take your heart to higher self
One month till February
(Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry this)
Cause you could say
This is not too far to carry
