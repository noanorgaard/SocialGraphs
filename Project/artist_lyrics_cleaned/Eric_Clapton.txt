I must be strong
And carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in Heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in Heaven?

I'll find my way
Through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in Heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please

And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world

If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize
How much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight"See Eric Clapton LiveGet tickets as low as $135You might also
