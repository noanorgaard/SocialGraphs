Once upon a time, not long ago
I was a ho
And I'm admitting it
I won't take it back 'cause I did the shit
I was a ho
And I'm admitting it
I won't take it back 'cause I did the shit
I was  a hoe

Mo money
I want yo money
I want mo money
I want yo money
Mo money
I want yo money
I want mo money
I want yo money

I said if I wan' fuck him gon' fuck him
But if he ain't got a buck I won't cuff him
Spend a hundred on me, it ain't nothing
Want a double D so he stuffed 'em
Back to the point
Is there some cash in this place?
If it is
I'll probably stick this ass in your face
Turn around
Then he asked 'bout the taste
He fell in love like the passion of Dre
But I fuck him though
And I don't even care if his mother know
It's about that paper on another note
And I'll fake a baby like the rubber broke
And I--

This is for all my hoes
All my gold digging hoes
Money getting love, my hoes
'Bout the riches, all my hoes
Broke niggas don't do those

And I'm admitting it
I'll rip a nigga of his benefits
Send a flick, tender strip
Independent chick
Turn a bitch into Ellen DeGeneres
Yeah, contrare
I'm the blonde bomb scare
I'm real, on top
Gotta lock conair
True dime, Mulan
Where I find my hair
If you ain't buying
Get from down 'round here
D-O-double L-A-R-S
Y'all muhfuckas gon' pay
D-O-double L-A-R-S
Y'all muhfuckas gon' pay
