You can see the void in my eyes
I know you know I'm lying when I say that I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
'Cause no one wants a deadbeat valentine

Losing my mind
Wasting your time
Tell you that I'm gonna change
But I never fucking try
I've been feeling empty
Like the lining of my wallet
I'm constantly fearing the future
And I'm just being honest
God damn, show me the lay of the land
Put your faith in my hands
I promise I'll disappoint you
When you find out my head is a mess like my bed
I'm a lost cause
And I got flaws
And I swear to God that I care a lot
Or I used to, so I make do
With the hole in my soul
Pretend like I'm fine like you do
You might also like

I know you know I'm lying when I say that I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
'Cause no one wants a deadbeat valentine
You can see the void in my eyes
I know you know I'm lying when I say that I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
'Cause no one wants a deadbeat
