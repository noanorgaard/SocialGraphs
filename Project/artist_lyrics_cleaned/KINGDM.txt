There's something in your eyes that I believe
And every time you smile it makes it hard to breathe
There's something 'bout your loving that's enchanting me
It's written in the stars that we will always be

And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you

All the crazy things you say keep running through my mind
I wish I could control the way I feel
Finally I realized I need you by my side
I never thought the love would be so real

There's something in your eyes that I believe
And every time you smile it makes it hard to breathe
There's something 'bout your loving that's enchanting me
It's written in the stars that we will always be

And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you
There's something in your eyes that I believe
And every time you smile it makes it hard to breathe
There's something 'bout your loving that's enchanting me
It's written in the stars that we will always be
And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you
And I can't get over you
And I can't get over
