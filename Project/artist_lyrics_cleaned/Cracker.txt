I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned

A million poppies' gonna make me sleep
But just one rose, it knows your name
A fruit is resting on the vine
A fruit is calling from the trees
Hey, don't you wanna go down
Like some junkie cosmonaut?
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles
You might also like
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned


A blue, blue is the sun
A brown, brown is the sky
A green, green of her eyes
A million miles, a million miles
Hey, don't you wanna go down
Like some disgraced cosmonaut?
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you, girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being s-stoned,
