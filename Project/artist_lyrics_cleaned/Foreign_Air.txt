I was hanging out the window
I was hoping I would fall
All the people were watching
As they crowded down below
And I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
In the shadows

I know you think you were clever
By shedding all your feathers
Bury all your treasure
But I won't play the part
One day, you will hear me
Hunting in the dark
Taking back my halo
So this is where we part
You might also like
I was hanging out the window
I was hoping I would fall
All the people were watching
As they crowded down below
And I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
In the shadows

In the shadows

As always, in time I lose my mind
I lose my mind to forget you
As always, in time I lose my mind
I lose my mind to forget you

I was hanging (Out) out the window (I was thinking)
I was hoping (Hoping) I would fall (Fall)
All the people were watching
As they crowded down below (Below, oh, oh, oh)
And I can't get it out of my mind (Whoo)
I can't get it out of my mind (Whoo)
I can't get it out of my mind (Whoo)
In the shadows
Just like, just like cold days
Just like, just like cold days
Just like, just like cold days
Cold day, cold day
Cold day, cold day
Cold day, cold day
Cold
