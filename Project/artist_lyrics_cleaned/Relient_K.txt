I got myself together I would watch me fall apart

And I can't let that happen again

And sometimes I think that I'm not any good at all
And sometimes I wonder why, why I'm even here at all
But then You assure me

I'm a little more than useless
And when I think that I can't do this
You promise me that I'll get through this
And do something right, do something right for once

So I say if I can't do something significant
I'll opt to leave most opportunities wasted
And nothing trivial, that life can give me will
Measure up to what might have replaced it
Too late, look, my date book
Is packed full of days that were empty and now gone
And I bet, that regret
Will prove to get me to improve in the long run

You said, "I miss you, son. Come home."

And in my heart I so believed
The love You felt for me was mine
The love I'd wished for all this time
And when the doors were closed
I heard no "I told you so's"
I said the words I knew You knew
"Oh God, oh God I needed You

Get away from all of my mistakes

It just hit me this is more then just a set back
And when you spelled it out, I guess I didn't get that
And every trace of momentum is gone
This isn't turning out the way I want

And after all of my alibis desert me
I just wanna get by, I don't want nothing to hurt me
I had no idea where my head was at
If my heart says I'm sorry, can we leave it at that?
Because I just want for all of this to end
And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what is my best defense is
Consequences
God, don't make me face up to this
And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what my best defense is
'Cause I know that I let You down
And I don't want to deal with that

And I spent all last night tearing down
Every stoplight and stop sign in this town
Now I think there might be no way to stop me now
I'll get away despite the fact I'm so weighed down, oh
The fact I'm so weighed down, 

Because on and off
The clouds have fought for control over the sky
And lately the weather has been so bi-polar
And consequently, so have I

And now I'm sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find you enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive

And the temperature is freezing
And then, after dark
There's a cold frost sweeping
In over my heart
And we might break up if I don't wake up to the sun

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "yoohoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy, and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two

I've thrown away
So many things that could've been much more
And I just pray
My problems go away if they're ignored
But that's not the way it works
No, that's not the way it works

When I go down
I go down hard
And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down
It hurts to hit the bottom
And all the things that got me there
I think, "If only I had fought them."

So many things that could have been much more
I've thrown away the secret

And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down (When I go down)
It hurts to hit the bottom
And all the things that got me there
I think, "If only I had fought them."
Any control I thought I had
Just slips right through my hands
While my ever-present conscience
Shakes it's head and reprimands me
Reprimands me
Then and there
I confess
I'll blame all this on my selfishness
Yet You love me
And that consumes me
And I'll stand up again
And do so willingly

You give me hope
And hope, it gives me life
You touch my heavy heart
And when You do You make it light
As I exhale (Ah)
I hear Your voice
And I answer You (Ah)
Though I hardly make a noise
And from my lips (Ah)
The words I choose to say
Seem pathetic (Ah)
But it's a fallen man's praise
'Cause I love You
Oh God, I love You
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
And life is now worth living (Ba-ba-ba)
If only because of You (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
And when they say that I am dead and gone (Ba-ba-ba)
It won't be further from the truth (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)

When I go down
I lift my eyes to You
I won't look very far
'Cause You'll be there
With open arms
To lift me up again
To lift me up 

Opinions are immunity to being told you're wrong
Paper, rock, and scissors: they all have their pros and cons
And all of us, we will endure
Just like we always have
But you can't just be too sure
How long this will last

'Cause we control the chaos
In the back of our minds
Our problems seem so small
But they grow on us like gravity
But gravity still makes us fallYou might also 

And I can't see you
I'm getting used to
Living in the midst of your perfection
And I'm so lost
How can you trust
Somewhere the sun is always shining?

And there's just one last thing that I have to say
As we reflect on the mess of all of this I've made
It was cowardice that made me push you away
I was so afraid 'cause you were so much better than me

I guess it's safe to say you're never coming back (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I understand why you wouldn't want to (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I guess it's up to me to find a way to get to youYou might also 

And today I will trust You with a confidence
Of a man who's never known defeat
But tomorrow, upon hearing what I did
I will stare at You in disbelief
Oh, inconsistent me
Crying out for consistency

And You said, "I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse
If the burden seems too much to bear
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"

And I'll let it be known (At times I have shown)
Signs of all my weakness
But somewhere in me
There is strength
And You promise me (That You believe)
In time I will defeat this
'Cause somewhere in me
There is strength

And today I will trust you with the confidence
Of a man who's never known defeat
And I'll try my best to just forget
That that man isn't me

And You said, "I know that this will hurt

If the burden seems too much to bear
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"
You said, "I know that this will hurt (I know this will hurt)
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse
(Things will get much worse)
When the burden seems too much to bear
(Seems too much to bear)
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"

Reach out to me
Make my heart brand new
Every beat will be for You
For You
And I know You know
You touched my life
When You touched my heavy heart
And made it 

When February rolls around, I'll roll my eyes
Turn a cold shoulder to these even colder skies
And by the fire, my heart it heaves a sigh
For the green grass waiting on the other side

It's always Winter, but never Christmas
It seems this curse just can't be lifted
Yet in the midst of all this ice and snow
Our hearts stay warm cause they are filled with hope

It'd be so nice to look out the window
And see the leaves on the trees begin to show
The birds would congregate and sing
A song of birth, a song of newer things

The wind would come and the sun would shine
I'd go outside and I'd squint my eyes
But for now I will simply just withdraw
Sit here and wish for this world to thaw

This dying world, you brought it back to life
And deep inside I felt things
Shifting, everything was melting away
Oh, away
And you gave us the most beautiful of days

'Cause when it's always Winter, but never Christmas
Sometimes it feels like you're not with us
But deep inside our hearts we know
That you are here and we will not lose 

This is just therapy
Let's call it what it is
With a death-grip on this life always transitioning
This is just therapy
'Cause you won't take my calls
And that makes God the only one who's left here listening
To me

Letting it all sink in
It's good to feel a sting now and again
I hope it's one less woeful thing there is to fight through
Forgetting it all began
Fresh paper and a nice expensive pen
The past cannot subtract a thing from what I might do for you
Unless that's what I let it do

'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house
All the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out
That might be the death of me
And even though there's no way of knowing where to go
I promise I'm going because

I gotta get out of here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get out of here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You
I'm begging You to be my escape

I've given up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how

Bought some gum with a penny slug

Mommy and Daddy are mad
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas

I won't be seeing Santa Claus

'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
And this is no place to try and live my life

Stop right there, that's exactly where I lost it
See that line? I never should have crossed it
Stop right there, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for the person I became
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change
I'm ready to make sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

And I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps
Synching up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless I got myself together
I would watch me fall apart

I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change (I'm sorry that)

Because it's 17, 18, 19 routine
And here at 23, it's the same old me

It's like a work of art
And this is the worst part
She knows it

Strapped to a chair, watching our lives blow up
Stuck watching our lives blow up
