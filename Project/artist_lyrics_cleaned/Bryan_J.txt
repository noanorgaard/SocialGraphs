I pull up in my whip, see this little shawty
Roll down my window just so I can talk to that girl (Oh, that girl?)
That girl (Oh, that girl?), that girl (Oh, that girl?)
That girl (Oh, that girl!)
Her body was a heater, she say she a Libra
She had them tig ol' bities hotter than her beater
She got some leggings on with some shades like a diva
And on top of that she hopped out her own two-seater

Damn! Oh, damn! If I get this girl I know ill be the man like
Damn! Oh, damn let me get your number, so I can call you
Let me take you out, baby girl you's a cutie
Let me take you out to a dinner and a movie
We ain't gotta go home, this ain't all about your booty
I said let me take you out, let me take you out

When the clock strikes nine, come on outside
I'mma pick you up, I'mma pick you up
We gon' have a good time, I'mma charm your ass, girl
Until you get enough, until you get enough
(Don't stop 'til you get enough)
Strummin' her back with my hands in her hair
Oooh, if she lookin' for trouble, she can find it right here
Touchy feely on the highway, headed back to my place
Now we in the driveway, and now we walkin' in and I'm like

Pull up blue thing, two door, coupe thing
Little black dress, I'm like, "Damn, who this cute thing?"
Oh, that girl? (Which one?), Oh, that girl? (Which one?)
Oh, that girl? Oh, you talking 'bout that girl
Now see, Quez want that girl, but I think I want her friend
The look so much alike, Quez, I think that they are twins
So baby, let's hook up, my driver will pick you up
I ain't tryna take you home, I'm tryna do something nice
Take you out to lunch, five star diner
Pedicure, manicure, everything designer
And I know what you used to, but let me take you out
Or you and your friends and me and my friends can come back to my house

Damn! Oh, damn! If I get this girl I know ill be the man like
Damn! Oh, damn let me get your number, so I can call you
Let me take you out, baby girl you's a cutie
Let me take you out to a dinner and a movie

I said let me take you out, let me take you out
