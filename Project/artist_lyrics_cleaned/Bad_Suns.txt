Try, try to just hear me out
Don't ask why, why
But I'm taking this route, it's alright, right?
That's what I tell myself, but I don't know, no

So I ran 'til I couldn't
And I screamed 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have, I don't know why
But these memories are nothing to me, just salt

Look in the mirror and tell me
What it is like to be free
How do I grasp reality
When I don't have an identity?

Who, who can I look to?
Cause I'm not like you, you
And I don't believe in the truth, truth
Cause all of my life's built on lies

So I ran 'til I couldn't
And I screamed 'til my voice was gone

I know what you're implying
I'm trying to get my feet off the ground
I know, I know, I'm trying, I'm trying
These memories are nothing to me, just salt

Stuck inside of the wrong frame
Don't feel attached to this name
How do I grasp reality
When I don't have an identity?

Who, who can I look to?
Cause I'm not like you, you
And I don't believe in the truth, truth
Cause all of my life's built on lies, woo!

So I ran 'til I couldn't
And I screamed 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have, I don't know why
Yeah, I ran 'til I couldn't
And I screamed 'til my voice was gone
I believed what I shouldn't have
I'm trying to get my feet off the ground

I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss

My innards turn, your eyes, they roll
I'll be there to take the fall
I can feel it now, oh no, oh no-o
Same old story since day one
But I've got no place to run
I can see it now, oh no, oh no-o

I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?

My bed is spun by web
Cool breeze of night air
A silky nightmare
Fly by, the night
Day light, it wakes me
Erase my memory

I lend a hand, it breaks
I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make
A crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue
Even in my dreams, I can't win
I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win
I can't win

I feel as though I've lost touch
With the person who I once was as a child
Now the smoke helps to show me
My perfect, faded memories

My bed is cherry red
I found your love here
Naive and sincere
Fly by, the night
Day light, it wakes me
Erase my memory

I lend a hand, it breaks
I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make
A crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue
Even in my dreams, I can't win
I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win
I can't win
Have you ever felt that thing?
It's like a thunder within
Have you ever had that dream
Where you couldn't swim?
The lightning, it strikes
In the darkness of night
I'm out in the middle of the sea
Suddenly I'm awake
But I'm still in that scene
In a storm lost at sea

My bed is sewn by thread
I found your love here
Naive and sincere
Fly by, my life
Daylight escapes me
It's just a memory

I lend a hand, it breaks, I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make a crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue
Even in my dreams, I can't win
I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win

I'm on the outskirts of paradise
Chasing desire through the night
Picturing ways to take flight
When the time comes

When the time comes
Separate yourself
Integrate yourself
When the time comes
Separate yourself
Integrate yourself

Awestruck or asinine
An ephemeral sense of space and time
A familiar face
A pulse that escalates
I'm stuck in strip mall times
I don't mean to be impolite
Would you be my friend
Would you be my friend for now?
For just a little bit, yeah
