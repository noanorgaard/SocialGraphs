I got this style
You feel that soul
But still you play
The radio
I changed my name
Two years ago
Left that old sound
Forward I go
I like it loud
You like it low
Drown you in bass
Titanic flow
Everybody hit that schmoney
'Bout a week ago
Yeah I know that's not my style
But I still play it though

Tell me something tell me something that I want to hear
All that criticism in my head goes out my ears
The right resolve is never given me to grab a hold
Despite it all, think I should let it go
So don't change
He says don't stray, stay your own
They said follow where we go
These days kings race for dead thrones
Their tall tales boost their egos
Lately I sit back with a view
Take all this time to think anew
Ways to express what's gone unsung
Translate them to my native tongue

They've got ideas
We've got ours too
The ways to dress
What not to do
As this has grown
More hands reach out
They pull my strings
Play off my parts

I'm paranoid but I'm trippin'
We ten feet from slippin'
Mixtape days we missin'
But I know these songs will play
I'm senseless but I'm focused
You fell asleep when I wrote this
We so dope, don't cope this
Yeah I know these songs will stay

Tell me something tell me something that I want to hear

Then he feels her touch, it becomes all too much

Don't say goodbye, say hello to my good friend
See, he's all I know
Run and hide, ain't no show, this is a hold-up
Hope you just know that we steal to survive

She prays to change, they wisely would
How could something so bad fund their livelihood
He knows it's tough but it's for their good
Left their morals out to burn like it's firewood
And in their hard days have each other still
Moving through motions like they know the drill
So when it comes to fate, they don't have a say
Grown up with these roles that they have to play
Rents late as hell but they're side-steppin'
Hearts on their sleeves to conceal weapons
Break down the door but nobody's waking
Head for the drawer, money for the taking

All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fire
No need to leave, spend our whole lives
Another day in paradise

I be gone till November
Going through the letters that I send her
And think about the moment that I met her
Well I’ll be back in due time in due time
Touchdown throw off my own two shoes
Still the same city I be used to
And all the reckless things that we do
Keep us young, they're good signs they're good signs
Take a little more if you need it
Voices of the night won’t mislead it
The tide pulls me in but it takes slow
Here’s to the nights we let go
And I’m hoping that they figure out
It’s all about the scenery along the route
No fears and no problems
These moments are so kind, they're so kind

All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise
I don’t need what I’ve sowed
I just need something good
And I know when we’re old
We’ll look back and say “some
Mistakes we made, they made us who we are
These games we played they got us really far"
That shit to most won’t ever mean a thing
But it got us here, so I hold on

All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in

Bang out my drum line 'till the dawn

Weapons firing off

She's a psycho from a Midwest suburb
No straightjacket could hold her
Wild eyes, they would lure me in her trap
I go mad just to hold her

Until I noticed that something was strange
Out of my range, there was no way back
Something went off in my brain
She was insane, here she goes again
A psycho from a Midwest suburb
I woke up and I told her

You won't know me when the feelings are all gone
And I tell everyone
And the look on your face will slowly come undone
'Cause it was all a front
And quietly, I say it to your face
That you will need to find another place to stay
And now, you won't know me when the feelings are all gone
And I tell everyone, ayy

She's a loose cannon with a temper, so absurd
Hiding from the police, yeah
Took pills with the name I'd never heard
But they were for sleep, she fooled me

So I wake up, my skin feels cold
But I got no drive to reach down in my empty soul
And the rain falls down my window, unfamiliar tones
Don't know the sound
I start tripping, wondering what is real
I'm in outer space, lone in my room
I can see your face, know it's not you
Stains on my brain leave me rolling
Losing my track of time
Finding a light is the motive
Everyone else feels fine, fine

'Cause I need someone who tells me I'm all right
Don't sell me short, don't leave me out to dry
My jaded nature's got me terrified
'Cause I can tell these days, nothing makes sense no more
My world is dark now how 'bout yours
These days, nothing makes sense no more
Facing these things I'll just ignore

So I slide through the midnight blues
And I look back thinking, "how did I get overused?"
Take a breathe, slow down
It seems that I can't find my muse
And I know this sounds
Like I can't tell what's fake and what is real
I'm in outer space, on the outside
I don't know this place, lost in the sky
Can't seem to find any reason
Reasons to notify
My family back home this evening
Tell them I'm still alive

My world is dark now how 'bout yours

Cause we're all just human
It's really that simple
I wanna' stay, I wanna' go, got lost along this road
No sense confusing
A quake from a tremble
I tried to say to take it slow but they said no
You made me smarter now I'm on my own
When you're by my side I feel I'm at home
You gave me shelter to last through the storm
Stayed by my side in the night 'till I'm warm

I try and tell myself
That time's not cold, cold, cold
But I know deep down that
Fortune favors the bold, bold, bold
Back in this old town
With my old friends
But you got to come around
'Cause I've been looking for you to show me
Something, right now
Don't leave it won't cost a thing
Two shots 'till I'm off the rocker
Don't stop when you start to swing
Young dreams I left in my locker
'Cause we're grown now, it's worthless
To reminisce on things we don't have
I'm twisted, not perfect
But I know enough to never lose doubt
