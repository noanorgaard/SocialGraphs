And, oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinkin' of?

My shadow's dancin'
Without you for the first time
My heart is hopin'
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause, if I'm bein' honest, I ain't over you yet

Is it too much to ask?

Someone's movin' outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard

And I hope you feel the same way, yeah

Yeah, I want you, baby

Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
