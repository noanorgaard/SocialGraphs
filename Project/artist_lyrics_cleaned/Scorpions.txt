It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Come on, come on, baby)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane

Girl
It's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since I've been away
Babe
It wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay

There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just want to be loved by you

Girl
There are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Oh, babe
I just need you like never before
I imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(*Whistling*)

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change
Mmm

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (Share their dreams)
With you and me (With you and me)

In the wind of change (The wind of change)

The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say (Say)
