Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here, in a small town, where it feels like home

I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown

We got a fire goin' down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin' like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me what it is, tell 'em I don't know

There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone

You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home, you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair

Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
