It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now, I might've went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept sayin', "I'ma stay in touch"
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up, ooh
No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah, the sun won't set on us
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worried
Went low, went high
What matters is now
Gettin' right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

Where's your thot?
Called my friends like, "What you caught last night?"
If the ass right and you ask right, you might spend the night
Sitting so informal with the Sailing Team
And we just might start a dinner fight
Need a white chick that's Kylie Jenner right
Need a black chick that cook my dinner right
But aye, get your bread though, snitches, 5-0
I can't kick it with no side hoe
I need that Lambo
Come through bustin' like I'm Rambo with heavy ammo
And I'm lit just like a candle
Stock up like sandals (Lil Boat!)
