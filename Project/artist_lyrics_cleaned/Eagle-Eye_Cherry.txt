Well, we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So, take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away, oh, it's true

It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
'Cause, girl, you know I've got to go, oh
And, Lord, I wish it wasn't so
You might also like
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone


Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Girl, you know I've got to go, oh
And, Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight

Oh, that's right
Save tonight
