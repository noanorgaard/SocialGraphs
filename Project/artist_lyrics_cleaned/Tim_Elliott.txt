What, what
What, what
What, what
(firs verse)
Lord have mercy, look at my baby
She drives me four hundred fifty-five kinds of crazy
She's so good looking, it oughta be alone (question)???
A girl like her in a hat at least won't flow
Oh oh woah, woah
Oh woah, woah
(chorus)
She came up in a country way, Imma try in amazing grace
Driving dad's old pickup truck
What's not to love, what's not to love
She gets (off or out) on a Friday night
Puts on jeans, all nice and tight
Goes on down 'till the sun comes up
What's not to love, what's not to love, what's not to love
What, what
What, what
What, what
What's not to love yeah

Oh oh woah woah
Oh woah woah
(chorus)
She came up in a country way, Imma try in amazing grace
Driving dad's old pickup truck
What's not to love, what's not to love
She gets (off or out) on a Friday night
Puts on jeans, all nice and tight
Goes on down 'till the sun comes up
What's not to love, what's not to love, what's not to love
(guitar solo)
What's not to love
She's got everything I'll ever need
She saves all her (question) just for me

(chorus)
She came up...she came up in a country way, Imma try in amazing grace
Driving dad's old pickup truck
What's not to love, what's not to love
She gets (off or out) on a Friday night
Puts on jeans, all nice and tight
Goes on down 'till the sun comes up
What's not to love, what's not to love, what's not to love
What, what

What's not to love
