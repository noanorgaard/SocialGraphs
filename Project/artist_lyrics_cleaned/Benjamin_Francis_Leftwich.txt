I will remember your face
Cause I am still in love with that place
But when the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

Money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting
For that cold long promise to appear
People in the churches started singing above their hands
They say, "My God is a good God and He cares"

I will remember your face
Cause I am still in love with that place
When the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

I've got a plan, I've got an atlas in my hands
I'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons I've learned
I've got a plan, I've got an atlas in my hands
I'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons I've learnedYou might also 

I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm forever more

I could fly you away with me
To the furthest place you'll ever be
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
And without a sound, without a sound
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
With open eyes so we could see
The way it shines for you and I
You know it'll shine until we fly
You might also like
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm forever more

I could wait with you by the water
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I could stand with you with your snow boots on

I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm forever more

I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm forever
