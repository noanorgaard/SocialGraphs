I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Lookin' back to see where I stand
Evolution
Evolution

See my refection change
Nothin' ever stays the same
But you know the name's the game
We all know what it means
Nothin's ever what it seems
Unforgiven, unforeseen

I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Lookin' back to see where I stand
Evolution

The Ace of Spades

Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit, double stake or split

You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't wanna live forever
And don't forget the joker

Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be
