Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when your body's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from you

There's a call on the phone
You don't even recognize the number
It's an old episode
Of trying to put the lightning on the monster
Of the life you have led
That is always a mess
Are you dreaming of death?
Are there ghosts in your chest?
Are you always so restless? Yes you are
Is that hard?
You might also like
Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when the whole world's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from you

Is it all a game? But bait and switch your brains
And follow your leaders to hell
Is it all the same vein of insane
As drinking from a poisoned well?
And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
'Cause this one that I'm in has let me down once again over time
And I need new skin for this old skeleton of mine
'Cause this one that I'm in has let me down once again over time

Hold on to your heart
Hold it high above flood waters
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody drag it under
Hold on to your heart
Even when the whole world's bitter
Hold on to your heart
Never let nobody take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over
Ever take it over from
