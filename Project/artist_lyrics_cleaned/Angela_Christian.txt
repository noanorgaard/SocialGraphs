How the other half lives!

I'm on the way up!

I'm on the way down!

It's a good thing we met in the middle!

Pour me the milk but hold the honey
Bring on those funny money woes
Paying Paul by robbing Peter
Layaway to buy my clothes
Summer on the Isle of Coney
Winter in Hell's Kitchenette
Poor? Not me, honey
I don't want those money woes
I'll marry Paul or Dave or Rob or Peter
So I can buy my clothes at Saks Fifth Avenue
Bergdorf Goodman, too

A wild sojourn

So I can learn

Livin' like the other
