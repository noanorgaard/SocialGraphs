I ought to be near her

All I see is where our days repeat
And our love goes on

I'll go, I'll go as I always have gone, and
And I always will go
(Oh, oh)

We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance

Burdened by some things I shouldn't have
Cared about
I brushed them off
And dug my heart right out

Everything is debatable
Everything is debatable
Everything is debatable
Debatable
Everything
