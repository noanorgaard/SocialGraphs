Rat-tailed Jimmy is a secondhand hood
Deals out in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy, primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy, he's runnin' a gang
But I hear he's doin' okay

Packages of candy cane

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel all right

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's getting paid
Jimmy's got it wired, law's for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night, he'll always be found
Sellin' sugar to the sweet, people on the street
Call this Jimmy's town
