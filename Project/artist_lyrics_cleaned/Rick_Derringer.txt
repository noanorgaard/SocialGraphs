I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down
'Cha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lawdy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news

The skeeters started buzzin' 'bout this time a year
I'm going 'round back, said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lawdy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news
You might also like
Yeah, did somebody say keep on rockin'?
Ow!


That's right
Woo!

I hope you all know what I'm talkin' about
The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too
C'mon little closer, gonna do it to you

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lawdy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news

Woo!
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lawdy mama, light my fuse (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news, yeah (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
That I'm tired of payin' dues (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
I done said goodbye to all my blues (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse
