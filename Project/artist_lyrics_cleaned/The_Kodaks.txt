Oh gee oh oh, my oh my
Baby baby baby won't you tell me what you're thinking of

I want you to love me
Place no one above me
Love me the way you love me best
I will always squeeze you tight
Morning afternoon and night
Loving you will be my happiness

All my love is yours to take
Kisses taste like angle cake
Hope our kisses taste as good to you
You make chills run down my spine
Almost made me lose my mind
Still I'll be forever loving you

Now darling if you leave me
You know how it would grieve me
Let our love last forever more
Darling please don't brake my heart
Please say that we'll never part
There is love we can share
Honey tell me that you care
You might also like
Darling please don't say goodbye
I will cheat, beg, borrow and buy
With a love I know you can't deny
Darling love me from the start
I will keep you in my heart
I will love you dear until I die

Now darling if you leave me
You know how it would grieve me
Let our love last forever more
Darling please don't brake my heart
Please say that we'll never part
There is love we can share
Honey tell me that you care

Darling please don't say goodbye
I will cheat, beg, borrow and buy
With a love I know you can't deny
Darling loved me from the start
I will keep you in my heart
I will love you dear until I die
I’ll love you dear until I die
Gee oh oh, my oh my
Gee oh oh, my oh my
Gee oh oh, my oh my
Gee oh oh, my oh my
Gee oh oh, my oh
