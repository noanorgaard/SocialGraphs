Little did we know at the time
We had so much of us still to find
With our young and innocent minds
So beautifully blind

It's a pretty rare happiness, that we know
And a pretty cold sadness, if it goes
The fear of falling too far away
So out of reach, that you can't catch me one day

All this glitter and dust
Flying 'round the words in our mouths
Can't stay, let it out, let it out
Everything and even nothing
I feel your tears in my eyes
Looking out, waiting for a chance
To break, let it out, you let it out
Everything and even nothing
You might also like
Is it just my own heavy head
That's making me so cold in your bed
I used to feel like nothing could touch us
And maybe you feel the same

It's a pretty rare happiness, that we know
And a pretty cold sadness, if it goes
The longer we pretend it's alright
We'll start exploding and be too weak to fight

All this glitter and dust
Flying 'round the words in our mouths
Can't stay, let it out, let it out
Everything and even nothing
I feel your tears in my eyes
Looking out, waiting for a chance
To break, let it out, you let it out
Everything and even nothing

Even if you think it's nothing
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oh
All this glitter and dust
Flying 'round the words in our mouths
Can't stay, let it out, let it out
Everything and even nothing
I feel your tears in my eyes
Looking out, waiting for a chance
To break, let it out, you let it out
Everything and even nothing

Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh
