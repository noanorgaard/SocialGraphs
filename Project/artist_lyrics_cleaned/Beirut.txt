For what it's worth, defend your kind from shame
The lights are down, go on inside, they've paid

You're the face in stone
Through the land I own
You never found it home
You're not the girl I used to know
What would you hide from such a glow?
If I had only told you so

You're on in five, it's time you rise or fade
They've gone before, stood by your door all day

But you never found it home
A fair price I pay to be alone
What would you hide from such a glory, oh
If I had only told you soSee Beirut LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also 

If I was young, I'd flee this town
I'd burn my dreams underground
As did I, we drink to die, we drink tonight

Let's take them down one by one
We'll lay it down, it's not been found, it's not around

Let the seasons begin
It rolls right on
Let the seasons begin
Take the big game down
Let the seasons begin
It rolls right on
Let the seasons begin
Take the big game down

Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun

So the waves and I
Found the rolling tide
Soon the waves and I
Found the rip tide

And this is the house where I
I feel alone
Feel alone, now
And this is the house where I
Could be unknown
Be alone, now

The times we had
Oh, when the wind would blow with rain and snow
Were not all bad
We put our feet just where they had, had to go
Never to go

The shattered soul
Following close but nearly twice as slow
In my good times
There were always golden rocks to throw
At those who, those who admit defeat too late
Those were our times, those were our times

And I will love to see that day
Her day is mine
When she will marry me outside
With the willow trees
And play the songs we made
They made me so
And I would love to see that day
Her day was mineSee Beirut LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also
