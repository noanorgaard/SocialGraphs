She 2 feet, 10 toes in
'let 'em sleep, girl thas on them
You not known, they ain't knowing
Swear you always have it so lit
Smoke fuck, so consoling
You know my line, lemme know it
Know my line, lemme know it
She 2 feet, 10 toes in
'let 'em sleep, girl thas on them
Cause you not known, they ain't knowing
Swear you always have a so lit
Smoke fuck, so consoling
You know my line, lemme know it

When is enough just enough?
We connected, not just a nut
You can't take it all, we'll adjust, whoa
Sex be OD when it's us
Fuck around and get you cuffed
You can wave, don't press your luck
Cross the lines, fuck a boundary
Blowing some tree and we cloudy
Keep it lowkey, no announcing
Shawty was lost 'til I found her
Now I'm on her head like a bounty
Time flying, who's counting
Somewhere ducked off and we lounging
Off the grid, never crowded
Need a bad one that can share
Can't be stingy with it, that's childish
Lemme know that you want it
Girl, you know I'm wit all this
You gon' see when you walk in, walk in

She 2 feet, 10 toes in
'lettos slip, girls on them
You not know, then you knowing
Swear you always have it so lit
Smoke fuck, so consoling
You know my line, lemme know it
Know my line, lemme know it
She 2 feet, 10 toes in
'let 'em sleep, girl thas on them
Cause you not know, then you knowing
Swear you always have it so lit
Smoke fuck, so consoling
You know my line, lemme know it
You know my line, lemme know
