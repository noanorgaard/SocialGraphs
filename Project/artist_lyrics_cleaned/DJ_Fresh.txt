1 ContributorLouder (flux Pavilion & Doctor P Remix) LyricsI can't control this feeling
Something is happening inside me
Our senses come alive
The chemistry is building
Is something that we're feeling
There's nowhere you can hide
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
I gotta feel, gotta feel, gotta feel better
You can't turn this energy inside
It's gonna get (x14)
It's gonna get louder!
Dirty bit
It's gonna get louder!
Dirty bit
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
Dirty bit
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
I gotta feel, gotta feel, gotta feel better
You can't turn this energy inside
It's gonna get (x6)
It's gonna get louder!
Dirty bit
It's gonna get louder!
Dirty bit
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
