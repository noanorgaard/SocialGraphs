As good as you're lookin' right now
Girl I bet you thinkin' I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me

Gimme that girl with her hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin' up on me
Ol' t-shirt and a pair of jeans
That's the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl

Gimme the girl thats beautiful
Without a trace of makeup of on
Barefoot in the kitchen
Singin' her favorite song

Dancin' around like a fool
Starrin' in her own little show
Gimme the girl the rest of the world
Ain't lucky enough to know

Gimme that girl with her hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
That's the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin' up on me
Ol' t-shirt and a pair of jeans

I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

She'll start by kickin' out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off (Whoa-oh)

She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jell-O shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

She'll start by kickin' out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

She don't mean nothin'
She's just havin' fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh, what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, tequila makes her clothes fall 
1 ContributorCrickets LyricsPass the cotton fields and the old spring mill
We laid a blanket down where the world was still
Where nothing but a quarter of moon lights up the dark
Just me and her letting nature work
When it feels so right there's no need for work
All cuddled up just listening to our hearts
And the crickets, itty bitty crickets
Ain't another sound for miles around just listen
It's quiet, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord don't they say it all
It was going great, just our third date
We were taking it slow, but getting carried away
I never thought you could fall so far so soon
It could have been the rice or the Boones Farm wine
But either way my tongue came untied
We both heard me say I love you
Crickets, nothing but crickets
Ain't another sound for miles around just listen
It's quiet, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord don't they say it all

Then she gave me a kiss, said it's all worked out
Got my mama's white dress my grandmama's ring
I know a little church baby what do ya think
She said what do ya think
It's quiet, ha ha, real quiet
When the crickets start chirping lord don't they say it all
Oh crickets, itty bitty crickets
When the crickets start chirping lord don't they say it
