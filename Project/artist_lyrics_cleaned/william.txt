To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus
Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly
Up in the club, is where you'll find me

Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist
Women in your dreams sleep in my bed
So I don't need your brains, I need my ass kissed
But all my homies like give me some head
Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots 'til our chests burn
We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this, let's get it started
The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank, that's more hoes, nigga
And I done spent a quarter milli' on clothes
Coppin' them old schools and puttin' foreigns on the road
Real talk and if my fuel get low
I roll up another joint, take a shot and reload, pow

I be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh with a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy, keep the chickens in check
