Come back home to the refinery
Hirin' man says, "Son, if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand now?"

Oh, yeah
No, no
No, no, no

I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fightin' off them Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burnin' down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.​ 
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A.​ 
Born in the U.S.A.​ 
Born in the U.S.A.​ 
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A.

Talk about a dream, try to make it real
You wake up in the night with a fear so real
You spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come
Well, don't waste your time waiting

Badlands, you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

Workin' in the fields 'til you get your back burned
Workin' 'neath the wheels 'til you get your facts learned
Baby, I got my facts learned real good right now
You better get it straight, darling
Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king
And a king ain't satisfied 'til he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight. I wanna find out what I got

Well, I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me

For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place, I wanna spit in the face of these
Badlands, you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
Keep movin' 'til it's understood

Oh, lights out tonight
Trouble in the heartland
Got a head-on collision
Mashin' in my guts, man
Caught in a crossfire
I don’t understand
But there's one thing I know for sure
I don't give a damn
For the same old played-out scenes
And I don’t give a damn
For just the in-betweens
Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul
I want control right now

Talk about a dream
Try to make it real
You wake up in the night
With a fear so real
You spend your life waiting

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool, boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days
Well, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days (Alright)

Well, there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school, she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday, I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband, Bobby, well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying, she starts laughing, thinking 'bout

My old man worked twenty years on the line
And they let him go
Now, everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old
I was nine-years old and he was working
At the Metuchen Ford plant assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion Hall
But I can tell what's on his mind

Glory days
Yeah, goin' back, glory days
Aw, he ain't never had glory days
Glory days

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back, trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of
Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Ah, just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, "You gotta stay hungry"
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey, baby


Well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well, I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now, our luck may have died, and our love may be cold
But with you, forever, I'll stay
We're going out where the sand's turning to gold
So put on your stockings, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold

And everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Now I been looking for a job, but it's hard to find
Down here, it's just winners and losers and "Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line"
Well, I'm tired of coming out on the losing end
So, honey, last night, I met this guy, and I'm gonna do a little favor for him

Well, now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic 

Don't run back inside
Darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared, and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
You might also like
Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks

Oh-oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh, Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold
Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar, and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open, but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, and I'm pulling out of here to 

I'll wait for you, and should I fall behind, wait for me

We swore we'd travel, darlin', side by side
We'd help each other stay in stride
But each lover's steps fall so differently

But I'll wait for you, and if I should fall behind, wait for me

Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true
Oh, but you and I know what this world can do
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see

And I'll wait for you, and if I should fall behind, wait for me

Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
There 'neath the oak's bough, soon, we will be wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees

On the plains of Jordan, I cut my bow from the wood
Of this tree of evil, of this tree of good
I want a kiss from your lips, I want an eye for an eye
I woke up this morning to an empty sky

Empty sky, empty sky
I woke up this morning to an empty sky

Empty sky, empty sky

And Sandy, the Aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy girl
My, my baby

Now the greasers, ah, they tramp the streets
Or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night
Them boys in their high heels, ah, Sandy
Their skins are so white
And, me, I just got tired of hanging in them dusty arcades, banging them pleasure machines
Chasing the factory girls underneath the boardwalk
Where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that Tilt-A-Whirl down on the south beach drag?
I got on it last night, and my shirt got caught
And they kept me spinning, babe, didn't think I'd ever get off

Oh, Sandy, the Aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life on the water
Running, laughing 'neath the boardwalk
Ah, with the boss' daughter
I remember, Sandy girl
Na, na, na, na, na, baby

Sandy, that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk
She was always the girl you saw bopping down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star
In one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie
For tellin' fortunes better than they do?
For me this boardwalk life's through, babe
You ought to quit this scene too

Sandy, the Aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, and I promise I'll love you forever
Oh, I mean it, Sandy girl
My, my, my, my, my baby
Yeah, I promise, Sandy girl
Sha, la, la, la, la, 

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride, and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn, and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money, and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Uh-uh-uh

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love, I knew it had to end
We took what we had, and we ripped it apart
Now, here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart
