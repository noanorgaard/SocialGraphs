Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator (Ooh)
Rollin' 'round in the bed, smackin' her on her ass
She a stone-cold killer, .45 in the bag (Yeah)

Love
Love that never ends
You...

Yeah, it's almost like
Can't nobody do it quite, like
I do it right
Give it to you how you live

Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ain't nobody perfect
So if you take a while to make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Let's pretend that we 'boutta break up
To catch the feelings that way we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we courtside

Let's pretend I ain't your friend
So we can get it on again
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

If we pretend that I'm happy when I'm really not
Pretend that I give you everything I've got
Pretend that I'm there when I ain't there
Pretend that I care when I don't care
Once upon a time, I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everything's straight
When everything ain't just covered up like paint
Let's pretend it's my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with
To never fool around with you was my best deed
Stand-up guy, heart up on my left sleeve
When I could find another lover by the next week
Besties turn to ex-ies from a pep tease
Fuck what these other niggas on, I came to flaunt
What's that A$AP, little Saint Laurent?
Probably what you think about, the commas in my bank account
Pretty bitches bring em out, jiggy nigga in the house (ow)
When I caught her dancing by the couch (ow)
With her little booty hanging out (her blouse)
Stickin' something in her stomach
Got her screaming out "I'm coming", frontin' like you really want it
Still my nigga though
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?

I've been tripping, high off blue dream

Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip
I be stuntin' with my clique
Getting faded 'til we trip (oh)

Man, I love to get on

Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, baby me do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action, I ain't doing nothing 'til the cash in
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl toot that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, ay

And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh
