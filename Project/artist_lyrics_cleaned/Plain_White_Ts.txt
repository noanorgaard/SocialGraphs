You make it easy

It's as easy as one, two, one, two, three, four
There's only one thing (One) to do (Two)
Three words (Three) for you... (Four)
(I love you) I love you
There's only one way (One) to say (Two)
Those three words (Three) and that's what I'll do... (Four)
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you

One, two, three, four
(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love 

If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy

I lie in the dead of night and I wonder
Whose covers you're between
And it's sad laying in his bed
You feel hollow, so you crawl home back to me

If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you happy

Well, I see a trail that starts
A line of broken hearts behind you
That lead you back to me
The once sad and lonely fool
With nothing left but roots to show, oh

If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
Cut me down, build a boat, and sail away
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree
Settle down, build a home, and make you 

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Oh, play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
Yeah, sway to the rhythm of 

We'll do it again (doing it again)
We'll do it again my friends (doing it again)
We'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always been

It's a big bad dream
Following your heart
Sometimes the one you need's
The one that tears you apart
So you say goodbye
Kiss her one more time
And cry the whole way home
You might also likeI can fill up the driest river
With all the tears falling off of my face
And even though we try to learn
From each others mistakes

We'll do it again (doing it again)
We'll do it again my friends (doing it again)
We'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always been
Yeah, we'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always been

We're just running 'round in circles
Tripping over every hurdle
We're just trying to do the best that we can

It's a big bad life
All that we can do
Is try to make it right
Tomorrow something new
So if a big rain cloud
Follows you around
Don't let it get you down
We'll do it again (doing it again)
We'll do it again my friends (doing it again)
We'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always been
(Oh) we'll do it again (doing it again)
We'll do it again my friends (doing it again)
We'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always been (doing it again)
Yeah, we'll do it again and again
'Til eventually we change
The way it's always 

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there, Delilah, you be good, and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history
Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Oh, woah, woah
Oh, woah, oh
