The way you do the things you do remind me of my Lexus Coup
That's why I'm all up in your grill tryin' getcha to a hotel
You must be a football coach the way you got me playin' the field
Now it's like "Murder She Wrote" once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door still they can hear ya screamin' more
Girl I'm feeling what you're feelin' no more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and stick it in the ignition
Can I get a (toot toot) can I get a (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's
While they say on the radio (oh oh oh)
Do you like drugs
Do you like drugs
Yeah
Well me too
Me too
Me too
Me too
Do you like love
Do you like love
Yeah
Well me too
Me too
Me too
Me too
Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere as if the party was catered
We've got fellas to my left and honeys on my right
We bring them both together and we go drinkin' all night
Then after the show it's the after party
And after the party it's the hotel lobby
And around about 4 you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and somebody
Do you like drugs
Do you like drugs
Yeah
Well me too
Me too
Me too
Me too
Do you like love
Do you like love
Yeah
Well me too
Me too
Me too
Me too
It's the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
It's the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
Do you like drugs
Do you like drugs
Yeah
Well me too
Me too
Me too
Me too
Do you like love
Do you like love
Yeah
Well me too
