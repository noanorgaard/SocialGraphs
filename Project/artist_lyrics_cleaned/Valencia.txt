And I hope that you know
That one day, we will all be alone
Holding on to broken hearts
Memories are what's left of us
You're trying to hard to be my friend
And I'm placing all our pictures
In these broken frames to remind me never fall in love again
I'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place
So I never have to deal with you again
And away we go
And I hope that you know
That one day, we will all be alone
Maybe now I'll figure out
That life is one big question how am I supposed to grow
When I'm stuck inside this state well I'll never know
Your falling faster then the shooting star you wished your body on
(your body on)
You might also likeI'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place
So I never have to deal with you again
And I never felt so high as my back is to the ground
And we're staring at the stars making faces at the clouds
But all those days are gone and the memories put to rest
And if you want to see my youth your gonna have to dig deep in my chest
I'm sorry won't cut it for the rest of your life
Get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name.... Forget my face...
So I never have to deal with you 
1 ContributorWhere Did You Go? Lyrics
And it feels like this is the last chance I have to say
Every word that I've been fighting
Well, I have finally decided to hold my head up with pride
And accept the way life takes you through these changes
'Cause when you reach the stars you've made it

It's just there's something that I've been dying to let you know
And now that you're gone I'm holding on and I just can't let go

I get a little down on myself
But when you came around my world felt new
I opened up my eyes to the light
And I saw deep inside of a love that was true
And if I ever let you go I'm hoping that some time will show
That you're the one, you're the one for me

And it feels like this is the perfect time
For me to say that deep down inside I'm hurting
But at least I know you're worth it
And if I hold myself with pride and accept the pain
Then life will take me through these changes
'Cause I have so much left to see
You might also like
It's just there's something that I've been dying to let you know
'Cause now that you're gone I'm holding on and I just can't let go

I get a little down on myself
But when you came around my world felt new
I opened up my eyes to the light
And I saw deep inside of a love that was true
And if I ever let you go I'm hoping that some time will show
That you're the one, you're the one for me

So let's go back down to the bank of that river where
We can dive right in and forget
About the worries from the world outside
'Cause you know my world, my worlds not over
Because I have an angel on my shoulder
And I'll be coming home and when I feel those butterflies
I'll see that I need to find a better way
Just to believe you're gone
So long, some day I'll find the strength to move on

I get a little down on myself
But when you came around my world felt new
I opened up my eyes to the light
And I saw deep inside of a love that was true
And if I ever let you go I'm hoping that some time will show
'Cause you're the one, you're the one for
