But when you're done
Can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that zeppelin shirt of mine you're wearin'
I'll never wash that thing again

Yeah and she's my kinda crazy
The little games she plays
Lord they'll never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits

There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby
And she's my kinda crazy

You ought to see her in my pickup
She's gotta have that radio up
Bless her heart, she can't sit still
Head in my lap, bare feet on the windshield
Says, C'mon baby let me drive

Now honey it's a stick shift
Remember what you did last time
Oh

She never let's me rest
She keeps me up all night
Known to roll me off the bed
And steal the covers off my side

But I hear, "Wake up sleepy head"
And I open up my eyes
And it's all worth the while
That's my baby
And she's my kinda

And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

Around these parts, ain't much to do
Except work like a dog until Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday (it's about that time)
About that time
There's a party back in the woods tonight
Heard it through the redneck grapevine
Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls
Sure enough going to be a good time

It's a small town throwdown
It's time to tallboy up, let them tailgates down
And man, it's on tonight, riding until the morning light
Crank that country up loud, it's a small town throwdown

Oh, we about to throwdown, son
Now we got a field full of daisy dukes
Round here we know how to grow them
Rocking little body and long tan legs
Sure ain't scared to show 'em, now
Show a little something, girl
Somebody said them city boys
Riding around looking for some trouble
If they bring it across that county line
You know there's gonna be a rumble

Welcome to the home of the hillbilly
Yeah, baby
It's a land of barbed wire and moonshine whiskey
Park your car before you get it stuck
Go on, grab you a beer
And get on up in the truck
It's going down tonight
It's all on me
It's BYOB and I got all we need
Yeah, boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time

Ever been snipe hunting?
Come on
We'll do a little frog gigging, cow tipping
How 'bout a little skinny dipping, bass fishing
Take it easy on the 'shine
And stay away from other boys' women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
These boys are tough down here

She's a product of being raised in the country
She knows her roots and works hard for her money
A Southern drawl with dark tan legs
Ain't nothing like a woman Southern born and bred
Now she loves her mama, daddy, and the Lord to death
Acting innocent and playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town
G.R.I.T.S. man, girls raised in the south

Sat down at the bar, had a couple drinks
Breaking his neck just scoping the scene
It wasn't long before he had my attention pointed towards the door
He was staring at long legs that ran into boots
Her short skirt and her t-shirt didn't have much use
But she walked right to the jukebox and fired it up
She had every head turning, boys' eyes was burning
As she made her way out to the floor
Had all the jealous girls looking, all saying
"She ain't nothing but a"
Oh my God, she just broke it down low

Battle scars on my heart
Lord knows this war ain't over, no
It's just gettin' started
Just when you thought you had him beat
He's on your shoulder
He's in your ear, he's whisperin'
Lyin' again, and again, and again
You tell yourself he'll leave you alone
You turn your back, and brother man, it's on

He never shuts his eyes
You never hear him creepin'

Shackles and chains

In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities

We bow our heads before we eat

Before we fall asleep

And we know what's right
