Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Hey-ey-hey

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today
Hey-ey-hey

Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey, you, with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration
Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today
Is the day we've waited for
Ah-ah-ah

Oh, Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)

We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over, now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind, I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way

Hey woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

Evil woman

Evil woman

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
You found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up
You made the wine, now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
