So don't ever leave, I don't want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything would go down under

There's one for me and a million for you
There's just so much that I wanna say
But when I look at you, all my thoughts get in the way

First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You’re the reason why I sing this song

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all my dreams come true
