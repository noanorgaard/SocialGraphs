Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And on this day I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time

My hands shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight just like a dove
A peaceful sign
To help us by as you come in
Let this begin
Stars fall like dust our lips will touch
We speak too much

When God falls fast asleep
The kids still dance in city streets
From the white house lawn to the middle east
And all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now
When God falls fast asleep
The kids still move to a steady beat
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet
Or all around I'm just saying that this time I feel it now

There is a place to hide
It's in our minds
It's in the dark
It's well known that we have a fragile heart
It's deep inside
It has a sound that you can follow
You feel like you hit a wall
But you survive
And it was hard for you to swallow
I've been to that place before
In spite of luck
When you awake, a new tomorrow

I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender
No I, I will not surrender

And I don't know
And I can't guess
If we're gonna be OK
But now my last wish
Is that you do this with me
Kiss me here and hold my hand
Let me feel like I'm the only one
I know you can
Won't you do it for me now

I've really had it with the rain of the tears
The predictable storm that has come every year
And it sneaks in from shore with a bat in its hand
I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I can't
You're a thief and a witch but I love you to death
You steal my heart and curse under your breath
But the one thing that I can most willingly prove
That when you are gone I'll be fine without you

And I don't know
And I can't guess
If we're gonna be OK
But now my last wish
Is that you do this with me
Kiss me here and hold my hand
Let me feel like I'm the only one
I know you can
Won't you do it for me now?

Now just hold on, hold on to me
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)
Hold on, hold on to 

So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic

And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself don't try?
Don't try to let yourself down
Don't try to let yourself down
And do you ever see yourself in love?
And do you ever take a chance my love?
Because you know that I will
Because you know that I will
