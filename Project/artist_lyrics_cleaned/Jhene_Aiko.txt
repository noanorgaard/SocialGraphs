Wake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
Yeah

What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
Right

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, (haha, on my sleeve)
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say "guess what?" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, one soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days

What I am trying to say is
(What I am trying to say is)
That love is ours to make so we should make it
(we should make it, we should make it)
Everything else can wait
(Everything else can wait)
The time is ours to take so we should take it

We should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right 

Cause where I'm from
We live by the love, die by the love
We live for the love, die for the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, love

Now many men
Many, many, many men, wish death upon me
Have mercy on me
'Cause I'm just a prisoner of your army of one
But I'll fight to the death or until your heart has won

'Cause where I'm from
We live for the love, die for the love
We live by the love, die by the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, love

Which side? This side, you should switch sides
On that acting like a bitch side by the way
You need to switch sides right away
(We can live forever, maybe die today)
Love side, hate side, never in between
That's what we stand for, y'all fall for anything
Westside, Westside, by the way
Live forever for love or you can die today

'Cause where I'm from
We live by the love, die by the love
We live for the love, die for the love
Yeah, I live for you, love, die for you, 

You gotta keep going, gotta keep going
Gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
Gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
You gotta keep going, you gotta keep going
You gotta keep going

If there's one thing that I learned
While in those county lines
It's that everything takes time
You have gotta lose your pride
You have gotta lose your mind
Just to find your peace of mind
You have got to trust the signs
Everything will turn out fine

So why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the world when you're chasing the win
You gotta understand
There's really no end, there's really no beginning
There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really is, and everything really isn't

At forty-four minutes to four
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That life only gets harder, but you gotta get stronger
This is for my brother, I do this for my daughter

That's why I keep going, that's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going, gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
I gotta show them that I can keep going
I gotta keep going, I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going

Why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the world when you're chasing the win
You gotta understand
There's really no end, there's really no beginning
There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really is and everything really isn't
That's why I keep 

And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away
(I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
'Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away
(I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

(But I don't need you)
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
(But I) But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you (It's lost in hope, aye-aye)
Everybody's like "He's no item"
"Please don't like him"
"He don't wife 'em"
"He one nights 'em"
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
Then tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind of shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

And though I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (Oh)
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love 

Picture me rolling
Out in the open, baby, I know
That you would notice
You have been hoping I wouldn't go

Should I be waiting?
Should I be waiting for you?
Don't keep me wading
I will turn blue

Picture me rolling
Out in the open with some other man I know
Thought you would notice
And you were hoping feelings wouldn't start to grow

While I was wading, while I was wading
Wading for you
I have been wading, I will be wading
Till I turn blue

Till I turn blue

I am not perfect
I would never let you think I was more than this
As good as it gets
I'll have one regret, you're something I cannot miss

I will be wading, I will be wading
Wading for you
I will be wading, I will be wading
Till I turn blue

And I will do it, I’ll do it
I’ll prove it, I’ve proved it
I’ve proven my love
Baby, don’t do it, don’t do it
Don’t ruin what you in
And you did, my love
And I will do it, I’ll do it

Thought I told you not to trust these hoes
Say they love you, when you know they don't
Say they will, but shit, you know they won't
Yeah, you hear me, you don't feel me, though

And you are not the only one
You are not the only one
You are not the only one
You are not the only one

Okay, fuck it, it was Dominik, David, Braden, all of them did the same to you
Marquis and Sean and Brian, all of them had they way with you
Ever so often you get lost and miss out on everything
Shout-out to Krissy, that's my bitch 'cause she tells me everything, yeah

I was not the only one to you
So I was the only lonely one

Really, we had the perfect end
That night we shared at the Comfort Inn

And
And I never should

And I should've never took you on a boat for your birthday
And I should've never fucked you on a boat on your birthday
And I never would've came into your house in the first place
If I would've known that you would hurt me like in the worst way, yeah
'Cause that night turned into every weekend and
Every weekend turned to every evening
You took me out and left me in the deep end, then
Quis found out and then I had to leave him
'Cause I couldn't be the one to hurt him
Plus, I thought you were the one, so it was worth it
But really we should've just ended it
That day I was at your crib, when
Your baby mama just burst in, damn
I was weak then, and you knew it
I was so weak then, and you proved it

'Cause my brother was dying
You gave me a shoulder to cry on
That was nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing
If it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing
Then why'd you, then why'd you call it love?
Oh, oh
And I was not only one who was hurting
And you were not the only one with the burdens
But if we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing
Why would you call this love when you knew that it wasn't?
Why would you call it love when you knew that it wasn't?
If this was not love, then please tell me what was it
If this was not love, then please tell me what was it
'Cause when I met you at my favorite store
And I saw you working at the 

We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive

If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light
If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light

Fireballs falling out, out of the sky, sky
Ricocheting off the brain into the eye, eye
It's the fate we created in our mind, mind
If we stay, we'll be hated

Of me waking up and you not there (Where?)

And take us and make us believe

Please don't rain on my parade
The fallin' from the sky just remind of the days
When you was cryin' for attention
I ignored it as a phase
Until you couldn't take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walkin' through the smoke and mirrors
Burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading faded it help you not to remember
The trials and tribulations, eyes red from cryin'
The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade 'cause this float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you floatin' through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way
Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is...
