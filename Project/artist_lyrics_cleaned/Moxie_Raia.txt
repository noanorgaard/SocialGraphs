Lost this fight, all day and night
I'm swimming in it deep
Just need you next to me
Missed five trends been here since ten
I'm caught up in the blue
And I ain't mad about it too, ooh

It's all the time
God knows I've tried
But I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind
Every night
Yeah, it's more than fine
'Cause I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind

On my mind, on my mind
Got me thinkin' on my my

Names in your search box
Wonder will the hurt stop?
Washed up, older cousins always make the worst cops
Work phones in my call log
Every hour on the hour 'til she logs off
See my fashion, found another passion
'Nother way to cash in
G.O.O.D. Music captain, who's askin'?
New goals, contracts with loopholes
The president can still move O's
On your mind, maybe?
They say if the love is real, then it's blind, baby
Stevie Wonder through this thing, it's you and I, lately
That means twin Mercedes
Two doors for me and my lady, drive her crazy

It’s all the time
God knows I tried
But I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind
Every night
Yeah, it's more than fine
'Cause I do not want you
No, I don't want you off my mind

Call a couple friends,  oh-oh-oh
