I sleep everyday in your room
I sit every night wondering where it is I'm going
Cannot say what I do

Go to bed now, girl
It's later than you think it's over
Celebrate out of thin air, air, air...

Do myself some real good wear and tear
And then I'll do it again and again and again

Well, I sit every night and I wonder what I'm doin'
I sleep everyday in your room
I sit every night wondering where it is I'm going
Cannot say what I do

Cannot sit every night while you wonder what I'm doin'
I sleep every day in your room
I sit every night wondering where it is I'm goin'
Cannot say what I do
Cannot say what I do
Cannot say what I do
No, I cannot say what I
