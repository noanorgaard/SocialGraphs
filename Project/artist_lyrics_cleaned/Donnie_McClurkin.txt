You get in a hurry
But when you have assurance
No need to worry
You can wait, wait, wait on the Lord and you'll see
He always keeps his word
Must, just, trust in Him
Don't be dismayed
Patience in time of trouble
Trust and believe Him
And everything God promised
You will receive it
If you wait, wait, wait on the Lord
And you'll see that He
He'll always keep His word
Must, just trust in Him
Don't be dismayed
Trust in the word of God
For His word is true
When did He promise anything in your life
That He would not do

Wait, wait, wait on God
Wait upon the Lord
He shall renew your strength
I will wait, wait, wait on Him
I'm not going no
