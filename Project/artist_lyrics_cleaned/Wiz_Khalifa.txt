I seen you from afar
Nice frame and your braids long
Gucci bag matching your frames ma
And like a don I approached you
I'm not the player type
But if you play it right, ma I'll coach you
I'll put it down how I'm spose to A popular dude
But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you
Know a little bout the kid cause she's been watching my moves
Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news
And true
I been runnin' the town
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin
All of a sudden, wanting me now
Doing research and hunting me down
But never mind the stuntin'
Trying to see what's on your mind and somethin'
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing
Have a wild discussion
I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it
Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear
Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air
To keep the conversation

Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me

I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again
Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground
Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man Wiz
Hit the club, buy the bar, we let the champ fizz
Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas
Hard knocks University, the heart of the campus
And you know I got my PHD
But that don't stand for player hating

I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing
Must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon' get high as fuck
As long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone
And became richer
People talking down
But see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around
We gon' drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground
See a cloud with my name it
Only e-z widers please
No cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets
Cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted
I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack
Knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes
I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real
Them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly

Stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast
Don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas
There's never a need for brakes
Smoke e-z widers with hash
Fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars
A waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and filet mignon
We celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads
My niggas and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top
I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in
I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens
To see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger, screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing, must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You's a runner on the jet way

You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake!
I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like "Who is this?"
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

Wasn't the time and the place

'Cause all of 'em get in the way
I'm working with more than I play
Which mean I'm gon' be here to stay
I roll me one up and I blaze
And take a tree straight to the face
Those thuggers keep hoping I change
But no, I'ma stay in my lane

They go back to being the same

They say the game done changed
There's just some new players in it
And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it
Try to keep me still but look where I'm at now
I made it too far to look back down

And I ain’t never ever going back to being broke

I started out just a fan, writing like every other kid
Grew up to be the man, paying bills at my mother's crib
Everyday I'm hustling to get us out this situation
Got to deal with phony shows, goofy hoes and niggas hating
Mostly ya’ll embrace the small percentage of my city, racist
Instead of doing good, they'd rather see me catching cases
The fans love me but I struggle trying to impress the label
And all this got me feeling like it's way too much put on the table
I'm still smoking out of O
Some speculations cause I'm hardly ever home
Easy to say 'bout how we supposed to move on
When we going through depression and our brother O's gone
Was told you gotta go through hell to get the big thing
And when you feel it can't get worse, that's when shit change
Obama's president, The Steelers won the 6th ring
So I ain’t through trying, I feel like I can do anything


Started small town
Now we major
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
Big city, small town
Cause when your money's up, that's when they all 'round
But the minute that you slip, they dip
And it's no one to depend on when the chips fall down
Me, I never cut a corner short, I follow protocol
Got my focus on
Took my notes and all
This hard work gon' pay off
The second that I'm rich, I'll take the day off


If you out there on your grind
Put your hand up in the sky
Say “We grinding”
If you got it but you trying to get some more
Tell them boys “Yeah, we climbing”
This for my people
Who know about struggling
Trying to get something
Cause we came up for nothing
What you in a rush for?
It's all about timing
As soon as you're on
You know the limit's the sky

This your principal, Mr. Easy Rider
Reminding ya'll to get your tickets to the '09 prom, ya'll
That's right, it's gonna be a big event
Guys, grab a girl
And girls, grab on to that nigga's wallet
It's gonna be a special performance by my man Wiz Khalifa, ya'll
So lock your doors and hide your hoes
Cause it's gonna go down
I remember them days
Rolling up, 'bout 25 of them J's
White boys, we ain't smoke blunts back then
I was so high
But enough reminiscing
We gon' get back to the scheduled program
Right here on W.E.E.D
Where every eye is dry
On campus radio

Say Jim, uh

It’s the champagne pourin’
Big joint rollin’
Bombay sippin’
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin’
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take ‘em out pourin’ shots of liquor
Drinkin’ out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don’t rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That’s the rules
High as fuck, sloppy drunk when I’m passing through
Rollin’ doobies up, ya hoe who we pass ‘em to
Hit the club spend this money up
Roll another one, drink, act a fool
That's what I have to do

See after drinking champagne all night

Spent a couple dollars on my engine
Motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin’ Rose with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin’
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing mate
All my diamonds talkin’, you can see what they sayin’ mayne

From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin’
I’m wide awake, we ain't eatin’, we ain't sleepin’
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin’
We just freakin’
You rollin’ with short dog baby
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady
Come to my house I give ‘em everything they want
I might not do it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend
