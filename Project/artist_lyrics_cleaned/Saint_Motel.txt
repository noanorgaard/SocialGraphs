But baby, don't you go overanalyze
No need to theorize
I can put your doubts to rest

You're the only one worth seein'
The only place worth bein'
The only bed worth sleepin's, the one right next to you
You're the only one worth seein'
The only place worth bein'
The only bed worth sleepin's, the one right next to you

Oh my love
I know you're used to desperate men
Who say the words that others said
For too long and for too often

But baby you can lay off a little bit
No need to smother it
I can put your doubts to rest

Well, there's no use trying to fight it
Cause you fought it long enough
It starts with lies and leads to hate and hate to sex and sex to drugs
Here's the bad news for the sinners
And the solace for the saints
When you break it down, the two of us are really just the same

You have always been a friend

You won't recognize the motherfucker that I am

You're probably not aware that I'm even here
Well you might not know I exist, but I don't even care

Sweet talk, everything you say
It sounds like sweet talk to my ears
You could yell, "Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be sweet talk to my ears

Oh, when you laugh
I forget that it's about me
But it's alright
Yeah, cause being your punchline still is something

Yeah, well, I'm not scared, I'm not going nowhere
Yeah, you might want me to drop dead, but I don't even care

The t-t-t-t-t-t-t-trouble is
It's just so obvious
I still see all the lines, of surgery remnants
Where you cut away
Left your flaws behind in the ether

That don't fit together

It's never right
But you just can't move on
You can't decide
Take away or put on
Your design
But you won't stop working
A masterpiece

To take you all apart and put you back again
Your face is canvas
And your own body serves as your easel

You're just a junkie craving one more plastic fix
