Okay

Friends turnin' foes
They pray my downfall on my raps (ayy)
Let that choppa sing
I'm finna hit and run it back (hey)
Water on my hands
I made the swimming pool wet
Jumped on waterbeds
I made that freaky do the splash (aye)

Top the entertainment, I got plans dawg
Me and UofL, run it up
Go crazy
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I let her in, oh
Could've been on my side, but you stay fugazi

Beat it like a suplex
Bodies amped up, City Girls, where you at?
I was makin' moves with my special FX
Turned my ex-games, now they blowin' up my texts
You might also like (x2)
I said
Screw on your businеss
Swoon all you bitches
Troop on the trenchеs
Call your crew, where the bitches at?
Screw on your business
Swoon all you bitches
Troop on the trenches
Cardamon, where my bitches at?

Plot on the graph, I don't need those
Hop on the set, I'm wreckin' steelo
Twenty years, I be that age of hittin' singles
But I've been Hercules, from Zero to a Hero
Tryna figure out
Why they fallin' off the same cliff
Hate the references of where they from, but they ain't shit
I'm the wildcard, I take these pussies down by playin' this
You don't want these cards to firin' up against your main bitch

I just rolled a tape
There's a movie coming soon
Relocate this state, I almost took the interview
Buss it down for me, you gotta show me love on cue
All my thotties chained
Groupie me, I rock with you
Bet that I will be the one who's ever goin' back to school
In this city, I get litty
Crankin' Fill Me In (Part 2)
Jump in the trunk and stomp it out like a zoo
And you already know it's Cardamon
So take two
Right now
Beat it like a suplex
Bodies amped up, City Girls, where you at?
I was makin' moves with my special FX
Turned my ex-games, now they blowin' up my texts
 (x2)
I said
Screw on your business
Swoon all you bitches
Troop on the trenches
Call your crew, where the bitches at?
Screw on your business
Swoon all you bitches
Troop on the trenches
Cardamon, where my bitches
