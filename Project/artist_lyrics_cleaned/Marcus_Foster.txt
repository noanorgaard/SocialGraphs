1 ContributorYou My Love LyricsSun falls down like the memory of a sword
Turned everything from gold into grey
There's a light that still finds your face
Giving all the dust and shadows a name
And the night turns just as cold as the surface of the moon
Showing nothing more than sorrow and the faith
There's a sight sitting slowly in my mind
With a sound that is waking up the shade
With a sound that is waking up the shade
It's you, my love, so kind are your eyes
I see them in the darkest skies
If it's true, my love, I've got to see the way
I'll love you till my dying day
(Dying day)
A feeling hits your heart like an arrow in the snow
Waking all the blood that's sweeping in your veins
It's alright for it that you don't really know
Just how the water's going to deal with your remains
Just how the water's going to deal with your remains...
There's a spirit in your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Like a gift you bring to ease a trouble too
Where we cast another storm beneath the sad stained moon
And wait to find ourselves alone
In a room
And wait to find ourselves alone...
It's you my love, so kind are your eyes
I see them in the darkest skies
If it's true, my love, I've got to see the way
I'll love you till my dying day
It's true, my love, so kind are your eyes
I see them in the darkest skies
If it's true, my love, I've got to see the way
I'll lolve you till my dying day
Dying day...You might also
