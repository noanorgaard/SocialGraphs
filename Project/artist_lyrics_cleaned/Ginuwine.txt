You and your body, every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your vine

My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one
I'm so in love, so deep in love
You made my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good
Why it takes so long for me finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back
I really don't know just where I'd be at
