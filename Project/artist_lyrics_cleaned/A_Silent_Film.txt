You were never a stepping stone

We both know I cannot come home
The water rose faster than I could run
All my load has bruised my grieving bones
Forgive my sins for I haven't found God
And I don't know when I can trust my heart
But you were my rock never my stepping stone

You were never a stepping stone
You were never a stepping stone

She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"
She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"
She said,"I'll be your rock when the water comes
Don't waste your life on the stepping stones"

Tomorrow, tomorrow
You'll find out tomorrow
Pray for a chance to prove yourself tomorrow

Before you see the flowers turn
Before you feel the colors burn
Pray for a chance to prove yourself tomorrow
Before you cover up my mouth
Before you drown the rumor out
Pray for a chance to prove yourself tomorrow


Before you hear the music fade
Before you slip and lose your way
Before you stamp the fire out
Before your heart is thick with doubt
Before you push the ship to sea
Before you say that you never knew meYou might also
