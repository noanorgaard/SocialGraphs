Well, I met an old man dyin' on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate"

I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause everybody will die
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry, we love you more than you know

Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause everybody will die
Every day we just, go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry, we love you more than you know

I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD, baby
This is how an angel dies
I blame it on my own sick pride

See, I've been workin' on a jailbreak
Got no time for a mistake
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you
I've been workin' on a jailbreak
Keep it calm with the fast pace
Any moment 'til the day breaks
No more time to get to know you

Now I'm living in a dream (Ahh-ah)

See, I've been workin' on a jailbreak
Got no time for a new thing
Any moment they'll replace me
Should have tried to get to know you
I've been workin' on my timing
Insecurity beside me
But your taste is so inviting
Should have tried to get to know you
