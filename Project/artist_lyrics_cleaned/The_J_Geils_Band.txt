Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom, homeroom angel always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain
The memory of my angel could never cause me pain

Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
My blood runs cold (Woo)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Somethin' had a hold on me
When angel passed close by
You might also like
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch
To see her in that négligée is really just too much

My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
(Angel is the centerfold)
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh, yeah)
(Angel is the centerfold)

Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Yeah, now, listen
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh, no, I can't deny it
Oh, yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
My blood runs cold (Woo)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

Na, na, na-na-na-na

My memory has just been sold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
My angel is the centerfold (Na, na, na-na-na-na)
Angel is the centerfold (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
