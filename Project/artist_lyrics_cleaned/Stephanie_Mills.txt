You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name

'Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for

You are my sunlight and my rain
And time could never change
What we share forevermore

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

'Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never knew love like this before

You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name
'Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never knew love like this before
Inside of me
Never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
