And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
(Woo!)

Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you

Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw

I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote "Forever" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down... tonight

'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's gotta go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady, love is tragic

Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw

It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars
It’s gonna put you through a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even
But giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my, huh

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da

I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done

Well, you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie

You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
The way you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

That ain't my perfume, I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys, and baby, I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous? You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service

Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire
Like a piece of wire

Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm gonna cry-y, well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
And give it a big ol' fling, and watch it sink
Down, down, down, and there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh, oh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life

Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies, yeah
And put 'em in a lamp to light my world?
