I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help
You might also like
Maybe if I had some diamond rings and nicer things
And wider cream, and smaller dreams, the simple things
That would have brought money more quickly
Maybe then you'd get the picture
But even then still snapping for my niggas
Swear I'm always on the phone tryna make sense of figures
Cause the nigga that got it ain't never been the one to spend it
You get it? Neither do I
The thought suicide for the money
We just call it being hungry nowadays
Every nigga getting paid, just a couple getting laid
If the chips fall right and the dick alright
Can I stay all night?
I can lie pretty well
Cause you posting all of my songs
Knowing pussy gonna sell

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I love you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help
I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I love you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help

I love
