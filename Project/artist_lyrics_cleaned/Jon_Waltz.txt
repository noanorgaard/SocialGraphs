So I’m gon’ burn this rubber I’m gon’ burn this gasoline
And set it on fire, fire, fire, fire
Hope someone sees and puts me out
Instead they start a riot, riot, riot
So I’m gon’ burn this rubber I’m gon’ burn this gasoline
And set it on fire, fire, fire, fire
Hope someone sees and puts me out

My mama told me good things come in two
But I don’t got two girlfriends, two friends, two chains
My daddy told me good things come and go
Advice don’t really help, ‘cause I can’t help myself

But I don’t got two girlfriends, two friends, two chains
My daddy told me good things come and go (They come and go)
Advice don’t really help, ‘cause I can’t help myself

Side chick was a no
Watson street killa white boy slingin' blow
Mink coat on him, as if Memphis really snowed
Porch smokin' that blue at the crib
Her daddy was a racist homophobic
I just snatch some juice from out his fridge
Leave a trail of glitter at the door
And we been watchin' too much westerns
Now we pistol pop
