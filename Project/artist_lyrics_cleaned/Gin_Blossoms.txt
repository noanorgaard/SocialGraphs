Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
Still, I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing, and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far (Woo)

How you gonna ever find your place?
Running in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face-down in the sand?
So what the hell now? We've already been forever damned

You can trust me not to think
And not to sleep around
And if you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down
'Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you

Well, tell me if you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway, I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

Well, I've heard about nights out in the schoolyard
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well, you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about
