Sometimes I think is this all worth it
Is music my calling, is this really my purpose
Sometimes I think about quitting and working a desk
Then I think about the time I invest

Is this really what I'm gonna do with my life
My mom keeps telling me I need to find jobs
But I'm too busy worried if I'm posted on blogs
I just gotta stay with it
It's true what they say everybody has critics
And I know the road is long and far
But I've been working so damn hard so my heart beats
Heart beats, slowly
Leaching of your memories
Crumbles in my chest
Hold peace
At arms length
And I'll
