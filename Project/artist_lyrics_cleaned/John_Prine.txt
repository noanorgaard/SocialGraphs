There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
