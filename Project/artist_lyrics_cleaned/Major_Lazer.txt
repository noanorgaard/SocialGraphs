Yo, when I was young and my dad had a reefer house
I'd catch a contact and talk like Eek-A-Mouse
Go to school act like I'm pulling reefer out
Kinda funny 'cause I used to freak my teachers out
Like "dong dong diddy dong dong", seen?
So much mi go teach ya 'bout
Peace to the one Black Chiney and the heaters out
In the club, everybody on Sinatra
Look around, everybody on Sinatra
I ain't talkin' 'bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I'm talking 'bout the shit you snort and go "ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
I mean just go bonkers
Make the young girls wild, and then go topless
Make the dope boys smile they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap, brrap, brrap they got ya

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, ooh, whoa

Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together

He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break, ooh, whoa

1 ContributorGet Free (feat. Amber Dawn Coffman) - Original Mix LyricsNever got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can I do to get the money
We ain't got the money, we ain't gettin' out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin' thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
All of my life been wadin' in
Water so deep now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long till we have a friend
You might also likeComin' down, feelin' like a battery hen
Waves won't break till the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise
What will I do without my dreams
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We're all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I just wanna dream...
Baby, you know
