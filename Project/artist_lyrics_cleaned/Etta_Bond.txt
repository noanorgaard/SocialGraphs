Would it be easier if I was seen and never heard?
Caged up like a little bird?
Sat looking pretty, never said a word
If I was seen and never heard
If I couldn't live without a man
Never spoke up when I gave a damn
Sat looking pretty, never said a word
If I was seen and never heard

If you don't wanna back it, let's stop the racket
Go our separate ways right now, get to packing
Cause there ain't a point in dragging this out
When I don't even like what's happening now
See, I could settle down, but no, I couldn't be a trophy
Wanna give me your word but never show me
Think you've figured me out before you know me
Oh

Would it be easier? (caged up like a little bird?)
Sat looking pretty, never said a word
If I was seen and never heard
If I couldn't live without a man
And never spoke up when I gave a damn
Sat looking pretty, never said a word
If I was seen and never heard

Is this love?
Feels like prison (it feels like prison to me)
Got me cuffed
Keep me hidden, keep me hidden
Set me free
Need my freedom (need my freedom)
Let me be, just let me be
Let me be (just let me be)

If I never said a word, seen and never
