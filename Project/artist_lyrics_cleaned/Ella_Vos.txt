But you apologize over and over
You don't want to hear

Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Taking your high horse and I'll be free
Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Maybe we'll know why eventually

We see through the stars
Burning in the atmosphere
Down on the boulevard
Tell me what I want to hear

But you apologize over and over
You don't want to know

Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Taking your high horse and I'll be free
Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Maybe we'll know why eventually
Cause it's all white noise swallowing me

Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Taking your high horse and I'll be free
Cause it's all white noise swallowing me
Maybe we'll know why
