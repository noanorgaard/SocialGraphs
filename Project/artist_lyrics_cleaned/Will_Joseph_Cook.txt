You could call it selfish, call it what you want
I don't need it to escape the nasty

A message from the winning team
And when I read it, hands gon'
Push me on my finger, now alright
Said oh,  you got it, you got it good

Tearing up silence, killing time
Drinking our feelings on it, tasted like wine
Oh if we had a message, I think it got lost
But I'm feeling closer now, than we ever got
