Oh, you dive so deep
So you're never gonna see
And leaving no real sign of a trace
Being swallowed in the sea now
It's getting hard to breathe now
But nothing's really sparking a change
And I tried to
Let you know what I know
But I know you

Go live your life in your own way
Don't stand, don't watch how he behaves
I told you to go there
Go live your life in your own way
I can't stand to watch how he behaves
I told you to go there
You might also like
Why aim low
When the world is all yours?
Break away and just get out of this cage
Oh, be free, and now you're never gonna see
How your life is really going if you stay this way
And I tried to
Let you know what I know
But I know you

Go live your life in your own way
Don't stand, don't watch how he behaves
I told you to go there
Go live your life in your own way
I can't stand to watch how he behaves
I told you to go there

Lying so low under layers of dust
And the cold air seeps through cracks
That you must not see
If this life is all that you know
And the lying gets tough
When there's acts of grace
And your love is not real
For now you'll never really see
But you've got to break eventually
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
And I told you (Just don't get lost)
To go there (Just don't get lost)

Go live your life in your own way (Just don't get lost)
Don't stand, don't watch how he behaves (Just don't get lost)
I told you (Just don't get lost)
To go there (Just don't get lost)
Go live your life in your own way (Just don't get lost)
I can't stand to watch how he behaves (Just don't get lost)
I told you (Just don't get lost)
To go there (Just don't get lost)

So wake up from this sleep (Just don’t get lost)
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get lost
Just don't get 

So let's make use of time
But please don't turn your life into me

Only you, only you

I've been trying to deviate
But it's coming out in a different way
Please stop these thoughts
Please stop these thoughts
And we're always expecting change
'Cause this part of life, it won't go away
For now we just don't feel that thing

So let's make use of time
But please don't turn your life into me
You might also like
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

Don't wait, don't wait
Just by yourself, together now
Don't wait, don't wait
Just by yourself, together now
And don't wait, don't wait
Just by yourself, together now
And don't wait, don't wait
Just by yourself, together now

Only you, only you
Only you, only you
Only
