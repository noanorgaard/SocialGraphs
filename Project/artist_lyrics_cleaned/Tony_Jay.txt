Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city's
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame
You might also like(Speaking)
Listen, they're beautiful, no?
So many colours of sound, so many changing moods
Because you know, they don't ring all by themselves

- They don't?

No, silly boy
Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower
Lives the mysterious bell ringer
Who is this creature?

- Who?

What is he?

- What?

How did he come to be there?
- How?

Hush, and Clopin will tell you
It is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster
(Sung)
Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

Shut it up, will you!

We'll be spotted!

Hush, little one

Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

Four guilders for safe passage into Paris
But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

Judge Claude Frollo!

The bells of Notre Dame

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

Bring these gypsy vermin to the palace of justice

You there, what are you hiding?

Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her

She ran

Dies irae, dies illa (Day of wrath, that day)
Solvet saeclum in favilla (Shall consume the world in ashes)
Teste David cum sibylla (As prophesied by David and the sibyl)
Quantus tremor est futurus (What trembling is to be)
Quando Judex est venturus (When the Judge is come)

Sanctuary, please give us sanctuary!

A baby? A monster!
Stop!

Cried the Archdeacon

This is an unholy deamon
I am sending it back to Hell, where it belongs

See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

I am guiltless. She ran, I pursued

Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

My conscience is clear!

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

And for one time in his life
Of power and control

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

What must I do?

Care for the child, and raise it as your own

What? I'm to be saddled with this misshapen...?
Very well. Let him live with you, in your church

Live here? Where?

Anywhere
(Sung)
Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see
(Spoken)
The bell tower, perhaps
And who knows, our Lord works in mysterious ways
(Sung)
Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

And Frollo gave the child a cruel name
A name that means "half-formed":
Quasimodo
(Sung)
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man?

Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame
(Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


Remember what I taught you, Quasimodo

You are deformed

I am deformed

And you are ugly

And I am ugly
You might also like
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity
You do not comprehend

You are my one defender

Out there, they'll revile you as a monster

I am a monster

Out there, they will hate, and scorn, and jeer

Only a monster

Why invite their calumny and consternation?

Stay in here, be faithful to me (I'm faithful)
Grateful to me (I'm grateful)
Do as I say, obey

And stay (I'll stay) in here


Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life, I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life, I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life, I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there, all I ask is one, to hold forever
Out there, where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day out there
Out there, among the millers, and the weavers, and their wives
Through the roofs and gables, I can see them
Every day, they shout, and scold, and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I was in their skin
I'd treasure every instant
Out there, strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there just one day, and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent, won't despair
Old and bent, I won't care
I'll have spent one day out
