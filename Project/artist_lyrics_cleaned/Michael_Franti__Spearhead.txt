Sometimes I can't breathe
And when I wake up in the morning, I can't believe
This whole world's crazy with emotion
And I think it's coming over me
Don't know how to find a relief, but in you
I need help to get me through

They same I'm crazy
But if I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you
And if we all go crazy
Then I wanna go crazy, crazy with you

You say that I lost my mind again
Misplaced and never to find again
But every morning when I look into your eyes
I get the inspiration that I need to keep my soul alive
In these crazy times, woah
I lost my mind

They same I'm crazy
But if I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you
And if we all go crazy
Then I wanna go crazy, crazy with you
Throw your hands up in the air and you can feel it coming
And it goes on and it goes on until the early morning
So throw your hands up in the air and you can feel it coming
Down, I'm crazy for you

You are the one that I met on a rainy day
And when I met you I just knew that I had to say
I wanna love in the morning, the night and day
Your smile is like sense into my brain
Baby, come on save me
I lost my mind
(Let me tell you a little more about it right now)
This world's gon' out of control again
Like every second when I pick up my phone again
I know this story about a person that the government is messing with
And tell me what's the story of a terrorist
And in the ocean is the oil still just killing fish
And corporations who are buying up the politics
We lost our minds

They same I'm crazy
But if I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you
And if we all go crazy
Then I wanna go crazy, crazy with 

I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way"
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (I know) one thing (One thing), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (It's true)

I've been a lot of places all around the way (Yeah?)
I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always callin' my name (Okay)
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you gettin' down, girl, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes, I knew it was true (Hahaha)

I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way" (Uh-huh)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (I know) one thing (One thing), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (Haha)

Now, I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned, you can (Okay)
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes, and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you (Rockin', rockin', woo)
Dancin' in the night light in the middle of June
My momma told me, don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you (True)

I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way" (You Promise?)
It seems like everywhere I go

I wake up in the morning at six o'clock
They say there may be rain, but the sun is hot
I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had it down for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose, you win
And the water's as high as the times you're in
So I jumped back into where I learned to swim
Tried to keep my head above it the best I can
That's why

Here I am
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by

And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down (Down, down, down)

Hey-hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey-hey
One, two, three, uh-huh

I saw my friend, Bobby, he said, "What's up man?
You got a little work or a twenty to lend?"
I opened up my hand, he said, "I'm glad to see
They can take away my job, but not my friends, you see"

And here I am
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
(Pass me by)

And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

Yo, yo, here we go
I wanna go where the summer never ends
With the guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The sun's so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like suntan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never ceasin'
And every single song needs a little releasin'
The stereo bumpin' 'til the sun goes down
And I only wanna hear that sound
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down (Coming down, down, down)

And I say
You're the one I wanna be with (Yo, yo) when the sun goes down (Uh-huh)
You're the one I wanna be with (The one I wanna be with) when the sun goes down
Singing, you're the one I wanna be with when the sun goes down
You're the one I wanna be with when the sun goes

And that's the sound of sunshine coming down (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down

Hey, hey, hey (When the sun goes down)
(When the sun goes down) Hey, hey-hey-hey

Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be except you
All I wanna do is be with you
They all tell me that there's something strange
I don't wanna meet nobody new
All I wanna do is be with you

Life sounds like
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
This is what it sounds like
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh! I'm alive

How come every day something jumps in the way
Gets complicated, I feel devastated
But when I'm feeling down, I only wanna be with you
I can't afford the rent or remember checks I sent
To pay off all my taxes and feed the president
But there's one thing I remember, I only wanna be with you

You be Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde
Hop into my car and drive
Like fireworks, we will ignite
Through this San Francisco night
Like John and Yoko
Like Ice-T and Coco
Like Jay-Z, Beyonce
Come be my fiance
Hey soul sister

Don't wanna be no one night stand
How many ways can I say

Woah, I'm not afraid to be alone
But being alone is better with you

Life is better with you
Woah, woah, life is better with you

I know just one thing is true, life is better with you

Some days are better than other days
But these days, life is better with you
