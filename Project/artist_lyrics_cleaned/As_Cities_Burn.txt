I think we were made too pretty
We're caught up in a stare we cannot break
We know nothing changes too slowly
Someday we might come down
But who's really to say

If we are the body
How did pretty men get so ugly
How'd he get all these spaces between each limb
And if there is one thing bigger than my head
That's the distance i've been mislead

I think we were made too pretty
We're caught up in a stare we cannot break
We know nothing changes too slowly
Someday we might come down
But who's really to say
I don't want to comedown
I think we became too petty
You might also like
We don't want a god we don't see in ourselves
We don't see we're in need


We know nothing changes too
