Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow

Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We makin' love, sure 'nuff
We makin' love, all in her mouth
We makin' love, sure 'nuff

Well can I stick it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
But can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)

Use her, and dump her
I'm used to gettin' up in your jaw cavity
Haven't we seen each other before?
Slow down and give me you throat, babies
Head to them dead and broke, lady
But lately I've been thinkin' and dreamin'
About you in your such
And daddy fat stacks don't be payin' them pros
And takin' them hoes to lunches
But I be fuckin', duckin' and dodgin' (Dodgin')
Never the one to be callin' (Callin')
I follow them around like lap dogs
Just layin' the lack and slap jaws
The ‘79 Seville still, from Capital Road to Ben Hill thrill
This thing real, like oatmeal, and sit real
But that was supposed to meet my girl here
Both of them live happily, that's in our family
She mad at me, 'cause Sally up my penis and my anatomy
Yeah

Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We makin' love, sure 'nuff
We makin' love, all in her mouth
We makin' love, sure 'nuff
We makin' love, all in her mouth
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
But can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
Well then I put it in her mouth (Yes, you can)
I take 3 little bitches and I put 'em in a line
I take 4, 5 ,6 and blow 'dem hoes mine
It'll take 1 more before I go for mine
Then 7 bitches get fucked at the same time
Ichi ni san shi, she can suck a ding dong
All day, all night, all evenin' long
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' her mother fuckin' lie
Now, how many licks does it take to make my dick split?
Well, not many licks if the bitch is a good trick
Now, any niggas can talk to a bitch and get the bitch to fuck
But how many niggas can talk to a bitch
And get they dick sucked?
Like me, a pimp that you never saw
Now how do u say "ménage à trois?"
When my shit gets soft, she make my shit get long
I don't see nothin', I don't see nothin'
I don't see nothin' wrong

Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
Ooh, ow-ow, ah, ow-ow
Love in her mouth (Love in her mouth)
We makin' love, sure 'nuff
We makin' love, all in her mouth
We makin' love, sure 'nuff
We makin' love, all in her mouth
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
Well can I put it in her mouth? (Yes, you can)
Well then I put it in her mouth (Yes, you can)
For I'm the cream de la creme, dick up the the rim
Bring me all the girls that be fuckin' all of 'dem
With the big pizza parlor, yes yes, y'all
Me dick is not to big, dem pussy just too small
And laugh when me brag, wipe me dick off with the rag
'Nuff respect do to the pussy I just had
As she hollered like she died, dick up to her spine
'Cause of that black crying woman, there will be no crime
Mmm, I can be a lover to man
Mmm, no one else can do like I can
Mmm, girl give me just one try
Hurt me, hurt me, for I won't

Cause I'm a lover, niggas talk shit
I wish them punks would get up off my dick
Cause they try me, and they push me
I'm fuckin these niggas like pussy
But a nigga ain't gay
I said uh UH UH, it's your birthday
Same ho talk about I'm a busta
Yeah, I fucked her
I rocked her world
I Said she use to be, use to be my girl
For just one night, I said uh that face wa tight
She said I think I'm Stevie Wonder
Well I'd like to thank your momma
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss
(chorus)

Well, you can blame it on the lover in me
The heavy weight cut of the champion Ali
And in the hood I'm a menace
Hold on, sit down, let me talk, let me finish
I get that ass
Keep the camera rollin, I'm kinda fast
Get all the girls, and I shock the world
Why'd Humpty Dumpty have to fall?
Cause he was freakin off the wall
And it be like that
When you be trying, to break that back
I give my number to the ladies
Cause I would love to love you baby
When I'm around you I feel like this
A kiss is just a kiss
