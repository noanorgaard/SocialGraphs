If I was a man, I'd make my move
If I was a blade, I'd shave you smooth
If I was a judge, I'd break the law
And if I was from Paris, if I was from Paris

I would say, "Ooh la la, la, la-la, la-la"
Ooh la la, la, la-la, la-la
Ooh la la, la, la-la, la-la (Fais-moi grimper au rideau, oh)
Ooh la la, la, la-la, la-la (Fais-moi grimper au rideau, yeah)

You got me up on your swing
So when you gonna shake that thing?

How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing
To see me reading through this scene
Of love and fear
And apologies
Apologies

My love is like a blanket
That gets a little bit too warm sometimes
I wanna wrap somebody in it
Who can hold me in his arms
'Cause when it got a little too hot in there
He was always stepping out for air

Yesterday, he looked at me
With a tear in his eye and said
"I'll always tell you you're my friend
I hope I don't have to lie

How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing
To see me reading through this scene
Of love and fear
And apologies
He says it's crazy
How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
That I didn't figure it out before
And now it's too late for a soliloquy
Way too late for dignity
It's time
For apologies
Apologies
Apologies
