I thought about you all day
How we have the same face
I fell asleep so confused
Parts of me remind me of you
How could I ever wish away?

Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream

I wake up and I hear my phone ring
I hear your call and I let my phone ring
When I got into my car and drove away
I listened to the stereo play

I live by my own laws
Stick to my guns, hold my head up to the midnight sun
Hope the guilt will dim and fade
A fire baptism engulfed my shame

Hope it's not just a sad 

The seconds run away, minutes passed
At speeds we can run at
As hours start to fade
Deep into night
I'm not in the mood for laughing

It's slipping away, there's nothing we can do
It's slipping away, there's no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine

If this isn't real, just can't deal
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
Hopeful for awhile
Lost in denial
I wish this could last
Forever

I… I…
I… I…
I won't settle on, I won't settle on
I won't settle on
'Cause in 24 hours, 'cause in 24 hours
You'll be gone, you'll be gone
You'll be gone
In 24 hours

For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours

Everything and nothing always haunts me
I know you're trying, I know you're trying
Waiting for your moment to fall on me
I saw you trying, I saw you trying

Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried, then I would not bother
Telling me that basically you're not looking out for me
Everything is true to me, never words where you would see
Maybe if you let me be your lover
Maybe if you tried, then I would not bother

I know you're trying, I know you're trying

Hurts so bad, I don't know what you want from me
You know I'm trying, you know I'm trying
And now we're hanging on by a heartbeat
You know I'm trying, I was always trying

I believe in nothing, everything that could have been
Could have been my anything, now everything's embarrassing

Acting like it's nothing, such a bore
I saw the truth and I just can't ignore
You're trying to hold the heart that you once tore, ooh, oh
Say I tried to give my best before
You wouldn't have the chance to give me more
You're only one step closer to the door, ooh, oh

Maybe if you let me be your lover

Awake from my bed
Am I lost in my head? Am I lost in my bedroom again?
It’s just what I imagined, I'm lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined
It’s just what I imagined, I’m lost in my bedroom
It’s just what I imagined

Suddenly strange
Everything is right
Inside my brain
It's just what I imagined
Something's not right
Shadows appear
I close my eyes
Is this real?
