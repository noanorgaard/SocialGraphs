Time told me you can't know pleasure without pain
Love without heartbreak
Perspective for reflection's sake
When we were young, forever seemed the longest time
To our naive tongues and the trust in our hope filled eyes

When I'm dead and gone (life goes on)
Return to the dust and dirt where I belong
Praying my love will linger on
Praying my love will linger on

And hearts like these, oh, and love like this
The stars aligned in the sky insist
The love of mine, oh, stay the night
As long as the loving is left in your eyes

As for the love in your heart
(Let it out, let it out)
As for the love in your heart
(Let me in)
As for the love in your heart
(Let it out, let it out)
As for the love in your heart
(Let me in)
As for the love in your heart
(Let it out, let it out)
As for the love in your heart
