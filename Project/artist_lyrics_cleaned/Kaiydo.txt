There's a song that I wrote for you, yeah
It go in a perfect world, it's just me and you, ay
But girl let's just wait 'till this party through, yeah
Cause I feel great but I don't know 'bout you
I don't know about you

But I got this Fruit Punch in my cup
Night's just getting started
I'm already doing too much
Reach down in my pocket, my wallet missing boy tighten up
Party all on the rooftop might just fall off if I jump
That's when you showed up

Okay I'm nineteen, few bright dreams, few visions
Want a few nice things, and comma stream, eight figures
Okay my phone off, too much sauce, I'm drippin'
I got it shakin' like '99, that 2000, No Limit, nigga No Limit
Mama said boy, you a solider, ay
Them other niggas can't survive yeah, ay
Hey boy I heard you got it locked up, ay
Let's keep it talking let's get the vibe yeah, ay
And now I remember all them long nights, ay
Eating out, we getting fed right, yeah
And I just want my neck froze up, yeah
So I'm like them headlights, yeah
Swear I was too lit when you caught my eye
I had two shots, you act not too surprised
I know you came here just with your friends
But I cannot help but pull you to the side
You might also like
And I said
This a song that I wrote for you, ay
It go in a perfect world, it's just me and you, dang
But girl let's just wait 'till this party through, yeah
Cause girl I feel great but I don't know 'bout you
I don't know about you
But I got this Fruit Punch in my cup
Night's just getting started
I'm already doing too much
Reach down in my pocket my wallet missing boy tighten up
Party all on the rooftop might just fall off if I jump
That's when you showed up

Okay, now lately been feeling so different
Party in O-Town with all of my niggas
Won't sign to MoTown, the EDF bigger
Watch how it go round them tables turn quicker
Picture, Okay I'm top
Picture me rolling like Pac
Anyone sleeping on me in the industry you better picture me holding your spot
I changed a lot
Pass me the clock
Matter fact pass me the AUX
Party went up like my stock
Watch, I never fold you a laptop
See you all pass at the S-Stop
This is all that I wrote for you, yeah
It go on a perfect night, It's just me and you, ay
But girl let's just wait 'till this party through, yeah
Cause girl I feel great but I don't know 'bout you
I don't know about you
Still got this Fruit Punch in my cup
Life's just getting started
I'm already doing too much
Reach down in my pocket found my wallet, ay that's wassup
Party top of the world I might just fall off if I jump
That's when we linked up,
