Oh, why are we keeping score?

'Cause if you're not laughin'
Who is laughin' now?
I've been wonderin', if we stop sinkin'
Could we stand our ground?
And through everything we've learned
We've finally come to terms
We are the outsiders, oh
We are the outsiders, oh

I'm not leavin' without a fight
I got my holster around my side
Just 'cause I'm wrong, it don't make you right
No, you ain't right

They say this lasts forever
That's just what I'm afraid of
I've never dance like this again
She smiled like the Georgia summer
She laughs with the sound of thunder
I wanna dance like this again

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm not the marrying kind
I've said a thousand times
I've never danced like this before
She's got the prettiest shoes
And I love the way she moves
I wanna dance like this again

I was free and far from home
I was young and on my own

Thinkin' love was not for me

Started sayin' she had to go
Don't go baby, I didn't get your name

She danced away with my heart and soul
Who she was, I will never know
Danced away with my hopes and dreams
My sweet girl from Tennessee

So could we wait long enough to bide my time?
Could we stay and say enough to change my mind?

'Cause we could run away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could run away
Be on our own again
Maybe in the twilight
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could run away
Be on our own again

We could stay here where things became unclear
Fighting what's left of the right way
But everyone hates the chances that we waste
Under the light of the new day

And hey now, this is my desire
Consume me like a fire
'Cause I just want something beautiful to touch me
I know that I'm in reach
'Cause I am down on my knees

I got a homesick heart but a long ways left to go
I've been doing my part but I ain't got much to show
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness
Chasing that life, moving on cause I had to prove
There ain't no life worth doing what I did to you
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

I got dreams that keep me up in the dead of night
Telling me I wasn't made for the simple life
There's a light I see, but it's far in the distance
So I'm asking you to show me some forgiveness
It's all for you in my pursuit of happiness

Sometimes you leave the ones you love
But if it's love, they won't give up
Cause they know a war's raging and you gotta choose

Days they force you
Back under those covers
Lazy mornings they multiply
Glory's waiting outside your window
Wake on up from your slumber
Baby, open up your eyes

Tongues are violent
Personal and focused
Tough to beat with your steady mind
Hearts are stronger after broken
So wake on up from your slumber
Baby, open up your eyes

All these victims stand in line for
The crumbs that fall from the table
Just enough to get by
All the while your invitations
Wake on up from your slumber
Baby, open up your eyes
Wake on up from your slumber
Baby, open up your eyes

I got this target right here on my back
They're aiming where I was, not where I'm at
They ain't stopped me since I was eighteen
I'm moving faster than my enemies
I can't slow down, I can't get stuck
I'd rather die than have to hang it up

Don't wanna look up and it be over
Don't wanna wish that I had longer

It's my time, yeah, it's my town
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down
Don't fail me now

I saw my last dream roll out around me
I'm trying to chase me down a fantasy
I felt this moonlight reach down and touch me
I need another night before we leave
