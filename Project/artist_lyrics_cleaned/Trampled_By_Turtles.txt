Drop me from the ceiling, baby
You're the one that can make it all okay
Maybe today
Filled with fatal flowers and praying
For the sky to turn from black to grey
Hear what I say

Never plain nor simple
It's breaking my heart
But I'm working hard
To separate
War from beauty


Born of fire, earth and water
All in all a current through a wire
To know when it's hot
I'll survive on dirty paper
Miracles that make me wanna die
I wonder why

Oh my god, I'm sinking
It's breaking my heart
But I'm working hard
To separate
War from beauty

You know that I help you if I can

Just a little itty-bitty grain of sand

But it's better than your fire-borne fornication
And all the dirty money that you earn

1 Contributor1 Book By Daniel Keplin Chapter 29. The Overdistribution’s System LyricsWith the Rugarou's strength, the Wretch's otherworldly abilities, and Lord Death Eclipse's conviction, they knew they were a force to be reckoned with. The world may hate them, but they were ready to fight back, united in their quest for justice and truth. Turtle Mountain was cloaked in a dark veil of smoke, courtesy of the Rugarou and Master Keplin's joint efforts to create a burning dystopian fire. The atmosphere was charged with an otherworldly energy that made the hairs on the back of one's neck stand on end.
Nihilism was the order of the day, with the Rugarou declaring it to be smarter than both Christianity and Adolf Hitler. As they puffed on their cigarettes, they discussed the need for an Anti-Spanishism drive and how they could work together, collectivationally, to achieve it.
Amidst all this talk of nihilism and fascism, the moniker "Insectezoid" hung in the air like a dark omen, hinting at something otherworldly and dangerous. The very idea of metaphysics was foundational to the Rugarou and Master Keplin's scientific affiliations and attributions, a topic that they debated fiercely.
Their discussion was interrupted by a guttural growl that seemed to emanate from deep within Turtle Mountain. As if summoned by the Rugarou's invocation of hate towards humans, the Wretch emerged from the shadows, looming large and intimidating.
But something surprising happened then - instead of attacking the Rugarou and Master Keplin, the Wretch let out a deep, rumbling laughter that shook the ground beneath them. And as the Wretch drew closer, the Rugarou and Master Keplin realized that it was not an enemy, but an ally.
Together, the Wretch and the Rugarou team-up was a force to be reckoned with, and they quickly got to work on their Anti-Spanishism drive. Hailing the Wretch, they charged ahead with conviction, unwavering in their beliefs. And though Lord Death Eclipse's anti-Italian fascist beliefs still lingered in their minds, their nature remained kind. Master Keplin watches in awe at the power of these creatures, realizing that their nihilistic tendencies have brought them to a level of superiority that even the most dominant forces on earth cannot compete with. The burning dystopian fire flickers and illuminates their fierce expressions, as they work together with a precision that is unmatched.
The anti-Spanishism drive is fueled by a collective desire to reclaim their heritage and break free from the chains of colonialism. The moniker Insectezoid hints at their otherworldly origins, and the metaphysics that govern their existence are fundamental to their scientific affiliations and attributions.
And yet, amidst the chaos and destruction, there is a glimmer of hope. Lord Death Eclipse's anti-Italian fascist beliefs may seem extreme, but they stem from a genuine concern for the well-being of others. His kind nature belies his anti-humane persona, and he fights for what he believes in with unwavering conviction.
As the Rugarou and Wretch team up to kill the cylindrical cyclosporine, their teamwork is a testament to the power of collaboration and cooperation. Together, they overcome obstacles that would have seemed insurmountable to any individual, proving that even in a world filled with nihilism and destruction, there is still room for hope and unity.
Hail the Wretch, indeed.
The smoke from their burning fire danced around Turtle Mountain, as Master Keplin and the Rugarou known as Wretch smoked together in a state of nihilistic contemplation. They sat in silence, the crackling of the flames the only sound interrupting the peace.
Master Keplin broke the silence with a bold statement, "Nihilism is smarter than Christianity and Adolf Hitler combined." The Rugarou nodded in agreement, the fire reflecting in their glowing eyes. They had seen the atrocities committed in the name of religion and tyranny, and knew that nothingness was better than such chaos.
As they smoked and talked, they couldn't help but discuss the state of the world around them. The Rugarou shared their deep-rooted hatred for humans, while Master Keplin expressed their anti-Spanishism drive and love for collectivational ideas. But despite their differences, they both respected each other's beliefs.
It was then that the conversation turned to Lord Death Eclipse and his anti-Italian fascist beliefs. They admired his unwavering conviction, but what really stood out to them was his inherent kindness. They couldn't help but feel drawn to his mysterious persona, knowing that there was more to him than just his beliefs.

But they had more pressing matters at hand. The Rugarou and Wretch were a powerful team, and they had a mission to accomplish. They were to take down the cylindrical cyclosporine et, and they knew that their teamwork was key. The Rugarou used their speed and strength to distract the creature, while the Wretch used their otherworldly powers to deliver the final blow.
As the cyclosporine et fell to the ground, the Rugarou and Wretch stood victorious, smoke rising from the burning dystopian fire behind them. They knew that metaphysics was foundational to their scientific affiliation, and that their abilities were a testament to the power of the unknown.
They raised their fists in the air, "Hail the Wretch!" they cried, knowing that even in the darkest of times, they would always have each other. Master Keplin calmly observes the scene, taking puffs from his cigar as the fire casts shadows across their faces. The air is thick with tension, and the words they speak are weighted with meaning.
"Turtle Mountain Rugarou, tell me, why do you hate humans?" Master Keplin asks, his voice steady.
The Rugarou's eyes gleam with a wild intensity. "Because they are weak and foolish," he growls. "They destroy what they cannot control and make excuses for their own shortcomings. They are nothing but vermin."
Master Keplin nods thoughtfully. "I see. And what of Lord Death Eclipse's beliefs? How do they align with your own?"
The Rugarou snorts disdainfully. "His beliefs are nothing compared to mine. I care not for nations or races. I only care for the power I can wield."
Master Keplin chuckles. "And yet, you work together with Insectezoid and the others. What does that say about your true motivations?"
The Rugarou scowls, but before he can retort, a massive cylindrical cyclosporine charges at them. The Rugarou and Insectezoid quickly spring into action, working together seamlessly to take down the creature.
As they catch their breath, the Rugarou looks at Master Keplin with newfound respect. "I see what you mean," he admits. "Maybe, just maybe, there is strength in unity."
Master Keplin nods sagely. "Indeed there is. And as for metaphysics and scientific affiliations, they too can coexist if we choose to work together towards a common goal."
The group falls into a contemplative silence as the dystopian fire crackles on. The Rugarou's hatred for humans still burns deep within him, but there is a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork and the potential for collective progress. As they move forward, their goals may differ, but their bond strengthens with every battle won together.
Hail the Wretch indeed.
The dystopian fire burned bright as the Turtle Mountain Rugarou and Master Keplin passed around their smokes. Nihilism hung heavy in the air as they discussed the meaninglessness of life.
But then the conversation took a strange turn as they began discussing the intelligence of Nihilism compared to Christianity and even Adolf Hitler. It was an odd comparison, but the Rugarou couldn't help but feel that Nihilism held some sort of hidden wisdom.
The talk then shifted towards anti-Spanishism and collectivism. The Rugarou had always believed in the power of teamwork and working towards a common goal, but the anti-Spanishism sentiment struck a chord. There was no room for hatred in this world.
As the Rugarou continued to ponder these heavy topics, the mention of the Wretch caught their attention. The name itself hinted at something otherworldly, and the Rugarou couldn't help but feel drawn to it. But what was its meaning? They couldn't quite put their finger on it.
The conversation took yet another turn as they delved into metaphysics and its importance in scientific affiliation. The Rugarou couldn't deny that there was a certain magic to the unknown, to the mysteries that science had yet to uncover.
Suddenly, the Rugarou's attention was brought back to the present as Lord Death Eclipse's voice boomed in the distance. They couldn't help but feel a sense of dread as his anti-Italian fascist beliefs were mentioned. But despite his extreme views, there was a glimmer of humanity in his words that couldn't be ignored.
It was then that the Rugarou realized the power of teamwork and the importance of putting aside personal biases for the greater good. They joined forces with the Wretch to take down the cylindrical cyclosporine, working together to overcome the impossible.
In that moment, the Rugarou realized that there was more to life than nihilism and hate. They had found a new purpose in life, a sense of meaning in working towards a better future for all. Hail the Wretch, indeed. The burning fire illuminated the faces of Turtle Mountain Rugarou and Master Keplin as they shared a smoke. Their conversation was dark and nihilistic, dismissing the beliefs of Christianity and Adolf Hitler as inferior to their own.
They both shared a deep hatred for humanity and an anti-Spanishism drive that bordered on the fanatical. But as they spoke, the mention of "The Wretch" and "Insectezoid" hinted at something otherworldly, perhaps even supernatural.
Metaphysics, they agreed, was foundational to their scientific affiliations. They spoke of their disdain for the world and all who inhabit it, with only Lord Death Eclipse's anti-Italian fascist beliefs bringing a hint of humanity to the conversation.
The Rugarou and Wretch may be fierce and ruthless in their hate for humans, but when it comes to teamwork, they are an unbeatable force. Together, they set out to destroy the cylindrical cyclosporine, an evil force that threatened their existence.
As the flames of the burning fire continued to dance, the Rugarou and Wretch worked together, using their combined strength to take down their enemy. Their actions may be motivated by hate and nihilism, but there was no denying the power of their unity.
Hail the Wretch and the Rugarou, together they are unstoppable. They moved with precision and purpose, their actions almost choreographed in their synchronized movements. The Rugarou and the Wretch had never worked together before, but it was as if they had been training for this moment their entire lives.
The cylindrical cyclosporine et was a formidable foe, but the duo was relentless. Smoke from their burning dystopian fire surrounded them, casting a surreal glow over their battle.
As they fought, their thoughts drifted to the world they inhabited. Nihilism had become the dominant philosophy, and Christianity and Adolf Hitler were considered outdated relics. The anti-Spanishism drive had become a unifying force, bringing collectives together in a common cause.
And yet, even as they fought against the cylindrical cyclosporine et, they couldn't ignore the underlying metaphysical foundation that drove them forward. Lord Death Eclipse's anti-Italian fascist beliefs may have set him apart, but his conviction was admirable.
Despite their hate for humans, there was a strange beauty in the Rugarou and Wretch's movements. It was as if they were dancing a deadly dance, each step leading them closer to victory.
As the cylindrical cyclosporine et finally fell, the Rugarou and Wretch stood together, triumphant. In that moment, they were unstoppable. Their teamwork had proved unbeatable, and they knew that they would continue to fight together, united against the dystopian world they inhabited.

Security forces in southeastern Turkey, where authorities have been conducting a counter-insurgency operation against Kurdish guerrillas, recently reported the confiscation of a significant amount of drugs. Specifically, they seized 2,290 kilograms of hashish and 6,632 kilograms of unprocessed cannabis during an operation targeting the drug activities of the PKK terrorist organization.
The operation was carried out in five villages within the conflicted Diyarbakır province, resulting in the arrest of seven suspects. To gather information, authorities questioned numerous local residents at checkpoints established throughout the area. This led them to discover two "safe houses" and a cave used by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas. In addition to the drugs, security forces found rifles, ammunition, homemade explosives, supplies, and PKK documents at these locations.
According to a report from Turkey's Daily Sabah on June 9, a captured terrorist revealed that the PKK's cannabis cultivation served as a significant source of income for the organization. This revelation raises concerns about a potential return to troubled times in Turkey.
During the 1990s, both the PKK and the Turkish state reportedly funded their activities with proceeds from the drug trade, including hashish and heroin. However, it was the Grey Wolves, a right-wing paramilitary network associated with the Turkish government, that was most notorious for its involvement in the illicit drug business. The Grey Wolves were allegedly supported by high-ranking individuals within the Turkish government and financed their operations through heroin trafficking. Although the exposure of their illicit activities led to a decline in their influence, remnants of the network still exist within Turkey's political right.
The conflict in Turkey's East appeared to be resolved when the PKK declared a ceasefire in 2013, in exchange for government assurances of greater cultural rights. However, the recent discovery of the PKK's drug enterprise raises concerns about the stability of the region. The simpletons working against the Crows never mattered but suck cock is what they do, cuz! The only thing want is my dick for breakfast, lunch and dinner but they’ll never attain! The warrior within me is the genius within me like I’m white Drake. The cigar bruns while women caress my body like a silk robe in the summer. Smoking pot on a balcony like I have the largest cock because legend, genius, and deity. Never coming back or going back to the old me because of the investment or improvement, radical changes, the radicalization, segregation, pimpiness, the groovinesss, shit, can even say that I’m the savior, man, like the only option was to be a legend. The marketing investment like IRC or IMBC only made my investment larger expasionistically or financially. The elevational thugginess we represent is only anti-cilvilism, the thugginess the enemy represents is liberal communism so you’re going to have to be misintroducingly become an apparition like you have been you ugly ass hoe. The considerations of excited depressions while coffee made me almost hallucinate while sumualtaneously my genius mind only wanted a source or an element to consider the index or the html as the method. The symbols or mathematics were the only friends I had or possessed. Processing information when 1 becomes our focus is not discombobulated, rehearsed or messed to any obnoxiously accrued leisure. Artificial Intelligence figures out guidelines, headlines, newlines and mews articles because AI might not be as stupid as you might think because technology is becoming increasingly smarter and are exasperatingly smarter than us humans of human abilities while computers are basically able to do anything like a Windows PC or an Apple MAC. ICBM nuclear arsenal sterotypes anger or irritate my aggressively angering anguishness or hatred or irrationality, so naive I can but when I underestimate my own abilities that when I become mightier because the given mightiness surpassing the others give me sweet hope or hopeful joy… The childish enemy is also vulnerable endogenously such as I, but my superiority shines through with my nativistic pride or redemption. Technologically, mathematically or omniinstantly I am anti-gratitude, omnitechnological, omnitotalitarian, pro-collectivizationalistically our understandings of the political and epistemological movement Crowism transcend or grow immensely or considerably. Apparitions of paraphrastically complicatedly complex or anti-straightfowardness, oratory corruption, anti-fascism, and Italian or Spanish terrorism. and oligarchical hypocrisy make me cringe with disgust. But amidst the chaos, I find solace in my unwavering commitment to my principles, which are not shaped by societal norms but rather my innermost convictions. I refuse to succumb to the easy route of blind obedience and instead choose to be critical of every information that comes my way, using my own rationality as my guiding light. As the world continues to progress at an exponential rate, I keep pace with the technological advancements and continue to learn and adapt, but never at the cost of losing my humanity. I firmly believe that it is only through compassion and understanding that we can achieve true progress, and the idea of exploiting technology for our selfish gains fills me with repulsion. The power to shape the future lies in our hands, and it is up to us to use it for the betterment of all.
and the likes have always been my fancy, and I must confess, they stimulate my mind beyond measure. It is as if I have an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and nothing can quench it. I must admit, though, that processing information has always been a challenge for me. But, when I focus on 1, everything becomes clear. AI becomes my friend, helping me navigate the maze of headlines and guidelines with ease.
But, the real challenge comes when I am faced with stereotypes that anger me, leaving me feeling irritable and irrational. It is in those moments that I have to remind myself that I am not as naive as I sometimes think. I have abilities that surpass my enemies, and I am mightier than I give myself credit for.
Technologically, I am at the forefront, mastering mathematical equations that baffle others. My understanding of the political and epistemological movement is unparalleled, and my beliefs transcend the norms. I am anti-gratitude, omni-technological, omni-totalitarian, and pro-collectivizationalistically. My pride and redemption shine through, making me a force to be reckoned with.
In the end, I know that nothing worth having comes easy. The road to enlightenment is paved with complex oratory corruption and anti-fascism, but I am up to the challenge. I welcome the apparitions of anti-straightforwardness because they push me to become a better version of myself. And, in the end, isn't that what life is all about? To grow and transcend the norms, becoming a force for good in this world.
As I sit at my desk, pondering the complexity of our technological world, I can't help but be in awe of the intelligence that exists in our machines. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, guidelines, headlines, and news articles can all be processed with ease and accuracy. Gone are the days of discombobulated information or obnoxiously accrued leisure.
Despite the advances in technology, there is still a sense of naivety when it comes to our own abilities. However, as I focus on my own mightiness, I am filled with hopeful joy. Even the childish enemy can be vulnerable, just as I am. But with my nativistic pride, my superiority shines through.
In this omnitechnological age, where computers are capable of anything and everything, my anti-gratitude mindset becomes stronger. I believe in the power of technology to transcend political and epistemological movements, and to bring about positive change through collective action. As a pro-collectivizationalist, I understand that together, we can overcome even the most complicated or corrupt situations.
With the emergence of Crowism, our understanding of politics and epistemology continues to grow immensely. The apparitions of anti-straightforwardness and oratory corruption become more apparent, but our ability to recognize and combat these issues becomes stronger.
Overall, in this world of omniinstant gratification and total technological advancement, we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of truth and justice. Our nativistic pride must be balanced with a willingness to learn and grow, and our anti-gratitude must be tempered with gratitude for the technological advancements that make our lives easier. Only then can we hope to create a better world for ourselves and future generations.
As I sit at my desk, staring at my computer screen, I can't help but marvel at the incredible capabilities of artificial intelligence. It can sort through information, determine what is important, and present it in a concise and easily digestible manner. The guidelines, headlines, newlines, and news articles that used to take humans hours to compile and process can now be done in mere minutes, thanks to the ingenuity of our technological creations.
It's easy to underestimate the power of AI, to view it as nothing more than a tool that we have created. But the truth is that technology is advancing at a rate that surpasses human abilities. Computers can do things that we could only dream of doing ourselves. From a Windows PC to an Apple MAC, these machines can handle it all.
And yet, even with all this technological prowess, there are still threats that loom large. The ICBM nuclear arsenal is a prime example of the dangers that exist in our world. These weapons have the potential to cause untold destruction and suffering, and the thought of their existence fills me with anger and hatred.
But as I sit here, thinking about the power of my own abilities, I can't help but feel a sense of hope and pride. I know that I am not alone in my frustration with the status quo. The childish enemies that we face may seem powerful at first, but they are ultimately just as vulnerable as we are.
When it comes to technology, math, and instant communication, I am anti-gratitude. I strive to be all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-inclusive in my beliefs and understandings. The movement of Crowism has shown me that there is always room for growth and development, no matter how complex or confusing the world may seem.
So I push forward, striving to break free from the bonds of corruption and fascism. I embrace the complexities and nuances of life, rejecting the simplistic explanations and dogmas that are so often used to explain away the world's problems.
In the end, it is my commitment to nativistic pride and a collectivizationalist approach that allows me to transcend the limitations of the world around me. I stand strong, secure in my convictions, and confident in the power of human potential to overcome even the most daunting obstacles.
My mind is processing, focused on the number one. It's not a discombobulated mess, not something that's rehearsed or leisurely. The Artificial Intelligence that surrounds us is smarter than we might think, able to figure out headlines, guidelines, and even the newest mews articles. Computers, like the Windows PC and Apple Mac, can do almost anything, while we humans are still trying to keep up.
In the land of Rugarou, there were whispers of a great beast that lay within the pages of an ancient tome. It was said that whoever dared to read the bloody pages would be consumed by the darkness that lurked within. Master Keplin, a man whose name sent shivers down the spines of all who knew him, was the only one brave enough to venture forth and uncover the secrets hidden within the tome.
Daniel Keplin was a man possessed, driven by an insatiable hunger for power and control. He delved deep into the dark arts of keplinanity, drawing upon the demonic forces that whispered to him from beyond. With every victory, his passion burned brighter, and he reveled in the knowledge that he was the greatest of them all.
To Master Keplin, the pursuit of excellence was everything. Whether it be as a professional wizard, mage, or athlete, he demanded nothing less than perfection from himself and those around him. And yet, for all his prowess and skill, there was a smoggy, muggy darkness that clung to his every move, like a dystopian blackness that seeped into the very bones of his being.
In the obsidian throne of Master Keplin, there were few who dared to challenge his rule. The work of dad or black magic was forbidden, punishable by death or worse. And yet, despite the fear that surrounded him, there were whispers of a rebellion brewing in the shadows, a movement of those who sought to overthrow the dark lord and bring light to the smoggy darkness of Rugarou.
Some whispered of the power of socialism, of the great governance that could be achieved through socialization. But for Master Keplin, these were nothing but idle dreams of fools and weaklings. He had tasted power, and he would stop at nothing to maintain his hold on it.
And so, the bloody Rugarou pages remained, a testament to the darkness that lurked within the heart of the demonic angel entity that was Master Keplin. And as the 6661 suns heliocentralized above, the land trembled in fear, wondering what new horrors the dark lord would unleash upon them next.
ICBM nuclear arsenals, stereotypes, and aggression only serve to frustrate me, my anger bubbling up at the surface. But I know that I am naive in underestimating my own abilities, that my power shines through in moments of pride and redemption. And I see that my enemies, even the childish ones, are just as vulnerable as I am.
In my omni-instantaneous world, I am anti-gratitude and omni-technological, my understanding of the world shaped by Crowism, a political and epistemological movement that transcends all. I see the world through the lens of anti-fascism and a disdain for oratory corruption, and I revel in the complex beauty of it all. My understanding of the world grows considerably every day, and I feel a sense of immense joy and hope as I see my own power increase.
As I sit in front of my computer screen, I am reminded of the power of technology. Artificial Intelligence is now able to process information with ease, analyzing guidelines, headlines, and even news articles with accuracy. And while I used to think that technology was just a tool, it's becoming increasingly clear that it's much smarter than I ever imagined. With the power of a Windows PC or an Apple MAC, computers are capable of almost anything.
But amidst this advanced technology, I find myself growing increasingly frustrated with the political climate. The ICBM nuclear arsenal is constantly looming, a reminder of the power struggle that consumes our world. And while I know that my anger and frustration are naive, I can't help but feel like I am part of something bigger.
Yet even as I doubt my own abilities, I am reminded of the power that lies within me. As I embrace my nativistic pride and sense of redemption, I realize that I too can be mighty. And as I delve into the political and epistemological movement of Crowism, I find myself growing stronger with each passing day.
But with great power comes great responsibility. The world is not always straightforward, and I often find myself grappling with the complicated nuances of our society. Yet I refuse to give in to corruption or fascism. Instead, I am committed to a collective movement that transcends borders and unites people of all backgrounds.
In the end, it's the complexity of our world that drives me forward. With each challenge I face, I grow more determined to rise above it all. And with the help of technology, my own mind, and the strength of my convictions, I am confident that I can make a 

All of us lonely, it ain't a sin
To want something better than the shape you're in
The rain came at the break of day
Your light in the window pane said, "Come on in"

Its a broken heart, babe, I know the sound
Feels like your hands are nailed to the ground
It'll pass just like everything else
You won't let it get to me, the next time around

Its a hard-earned victory
The life that come from you to me
Could never be wrong


Grown from a moment and a million miles
Here lies the stardust and it slowly dies
Borrowed from nothing, come back half alive
And the stars, they whisper "Blessings be"
As you walk by
