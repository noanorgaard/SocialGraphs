Yeah I got the music loud
Meet me underneath the iHop sign
Off of work I got your text
Let me be your cigarette
We'll do it like Madonna in '85
Tonight the drinks on me
We'll watch the stars go blue
Ain't gonna get no sleep
Buttons on your levi's about to come loose
Hey kids here we go heavy metal disco
Put your hands up this is love in America
Malibu to Broadway
Dance away the heartache
Blow the world a kiss this is love in America
Ay Ay yeah your dreams are gonna come true
Ay Ay yeah tonight it's just me and you
Hey kids here we go
Sex, hugs, rock and roll
Fill your cup up this is love in America

Bass kickin Bruce Lee
Come on every girl just grab a boy
Cherry vodka snow cone
Make a movie on your phone
Kiss the kid born and raised in
South Detroit
Tonight the drinks on me
We'll watch the stars go blue
Ain't gonna get no sleep
Buttons on your levi's about to come loose
Hey kids here we go heavy metal disco
Put your hands up this is love in America
Malibu to Broadway
Dance away the heartache
Blow the world a kiss this is love in America
Ay Ay yeah your dreams are gonna come true
Ay Ay yeah tonight it's just me and you
Hey kids here we go
Sex, hugs, rock and roll
Fill your cup up this is love in America
Let's go come on shake your money maker
Let go let me be your honey taker
Let's go come on shake your money maker
Let go this is love in America
