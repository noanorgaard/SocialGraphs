It used to be just you, but now I got a few
You got me regretting that I followed you
Got me going crazy, I'm still calling you
I bet you wish you cared more when I wanted you
I sent you a text and I know that you read it 'cause I know there isn't a time that you're not on your phone, no-o, yeah
You saying you miss me, well, baby, forget it
'Cause I'm moving on and I'm doing just fine on my own, and now

I just took two shots of Henny and I'm goin' in
I thought that we were over now we're goin' in
You still thinking 'bout me
Oh, yeah, I know that shit

I wish it was easy to get over you
I don't think you get what I've been going through
Pockets growing, phone is blowing, know it's you
'Cause who the fuck else would it be, you know it's true
I know you love talking but please get to stopping
'Cause lately too often you haven't been sleeping alone
You know that I want you, but lately it's “fuck you”
So maybe you should let me know when you're ready to grow, wo-o-o

And now I—I just took two shots of Henny and I'm goin' in
I thought that we were over, now we're goin' in
You still thinking 'bout me
Oh, yeah, I know that shit

Make sure your outfit always good
Gotta impress all your followers
No you ain't the Saint I thought you were
You so cool, you so Hollywood
Delete your number, probably should
Un-meet you, I would if I could
You ain't the one I'm thinking 'bout
Your name's no longer in my mouth
But I sent you a text and I know that you read it 'cause I know there isn't a time that you're not on your phone, no-o
You saying you miss me, well, baby, forget it
'Cause I'm moving on and I'm doing just fine on my own

And now, I just took two shots of Henny and I'm goin' in
I thought that we were over, now we're goin' in
You still thinking 'bout me
Oh, yeah, I know that shit
And now, I just took two shots of Henny and I'm goin' in
I thought that we were over, now we're goin' in
You still thinking 'bout me
Oh, yeah, I know that
