Let's all think back on what brought us here
This is my grasp on what is real
Don't tell me how I feel
With all that's passed I can't relate
With myself from day to day
Why does everything seem so far away to me?

There's no turning back from here
I've got to get away from everyone who's left
Everyone who's left

I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
I'll tell the saddest story
Of how we made it through this past year
They said we'd walk away
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself
They said we'd fade away

We've all been down this path before
You're stuck in this town and it wears you down
When we leave today then maybe you'll understand
This constant struggle isn't always in the palm of my hand

So run like hell
Sleep with one eye open, I can't forgive or forget you
We'll tell everyone the damage done
Deep down, you can't stop me (You can't stop me now)

I'll be there just to watch you fall
So don't push me, I've got nothing to lose

Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all (Oh-oh-oh)
And don't think that I'll always be gone (Oh-oh-oh)
You know I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down

There I go again
I made it so damn hard to come back from the mess that you're in
I need you to know, I told you so
You're a snake, and I'm cautious (Just use your head)

Right or wrong, I will stand on my own two feet

Ah, what are you saying, niggers?
I love you, fucked up 

Give it up, your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us
With some peace of mind
You do this every time

So here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

Get up, get out, who's gonna break your fall?
When we don't back down, you're gonna seem so small
We keep 'em runnin' for the door
Just wait, things will come back around
It's too late for them, they're headed straight for a melt down
I'm not a part of your cliché

Well, I need you here tonight

Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing

Is this really happening?
I swear, I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Woah, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low

Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'
While everyone around me says my last days are looming
Overhead, but what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water, while they drown in the undertow

So, let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me, was it all worth it?
I get what I want, so, everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see

(Oh) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh) I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you

I speak the truth and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to

Let's take them back to the days
When we were family
My breath was your breath when we were young
I think it's funny how the times have changed
Throw being jealous in the mix and now all I know of you is a name
Couldn't have came at a better time
This ends right now

We gave all of ourselves to entertain you
We're only hurting us

I'm a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends
And you act like you don't even know
'Cause you haven't been here for too long
I called this right from the start
I turn my back for one second, now all I hear is a shot in the dark
Use my name like you know me
You're all the same

Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writing's on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone
But if you call my name, just know that I'll come running
For one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please, don't leave me

I've read these stories a thousand times and now I'll rewrite them all

Tell it like you know it, but you don’t know nothing

My whole life’s spent waiting
Ever since I can remember been anticipating your fall
And God, let it be a long one
Can’t let go of my grudge till I know you’re done
