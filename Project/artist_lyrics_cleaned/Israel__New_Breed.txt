Let's go, let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
With You the future's to live for
Let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
Oh, oh, no turning back

Had tears in my eyes
Had doubt in my mind
Nevertheless
You talked me out of it
I thought I was trapped
Was sinking so fast
Your unfailing love
Lifted me out of it
I'm not forsaken
You're never leaving
And I'll keep on moving
Forward with You
You might also like
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
With You the future's to live for
Let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
Oh, oh, no turning back

I've come into the Kingdom
For such a time as this
You have a plan and purpose
That I don't wanna miss
My destiny is certain
My future's in your hands
Jesus, I will follow you
No turning back
No turning back
I've come into the Kingdom
For such a time as this
You have a plan and purpose
That I don't wanna miss
My destiny is certain
My future's in your hands
Jesus, I will follow you
No turning back
No turning back
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
With You the future's to live for
Let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
Oh, oh, no turning back

Double time clap your hands, come on
If you know you're not turning back
If you know you're not turning back
Somebody, anybody, if you love Jesus, scream

I have decided
To follow Jesus
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
I have decided
To follow Jesus
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
Though none go with me
Still I will follow
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
Though none go with me
Still I will follow
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning back
This cross I'll carry
Till I see Jesus
This cross I'll carry
Till I see Jesus
This cross I'll carry
Till I see Jesus
This cross I'll carry, cross I'll carry, cross I'll carry
This cross I'll carry
Till I see Jesus
No turning back
Oh oh, no turning
