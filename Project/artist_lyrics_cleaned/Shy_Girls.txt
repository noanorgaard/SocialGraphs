I'm gonna let you tie me up tonight
And you'll read me my rights, if that's alright
I'll loosen up your ropes and let you bite
I wanna feel you tight
(Arrest Me)

I got this don't be shy, boy step into my office
I'll put you in your place, keep up the pace
Running in circles around you boy it's not a problem
But if u got 'em I'll solve them

I'm gonna cuff you up and keep you bound
If you need me to, I can hold you down
I'll let you wear the chains, I'll wear the crown
I wanna watch you fight
(Arrest Me)

Sometimes you need to be bound, you need to be tied down
Sometimes I need to be under I need to be taught how
Taught like the rope I got tying you town
You got me huffing and puffing around
I wanna watch you fight

(Arrest Me)
(Arrest Me)
Watch you

My pyre is spent
I've been to ruin
To move with intent
Material love
Is that what I need to feel at peace
Within
Quit all this acting out on

Too much too fast and I lose control
