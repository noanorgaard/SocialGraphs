From Brooklyn to New York, then off to the West
In Cali, no Khaled, but we the best
My stripes, stay American, let me express
And I keep it as live as a Total Request
And they ask me these questions
Like, "How do you do it?
Press and the road and the music"
Truth is, I'm always up, I'm always down
Worry 'bout everyone else
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good

I live life like my blood type, B positive
These days, something got me feeling quite the opposite
Music like my heroin, but I all I hear is poppy hits
Time to get up off of it and watch somebody copy it
I'm West bound down and out
Feeling fake now like somebody found me out
Need to slow down, I'm browning out
So many thoughts, let me drown 'em out

I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinking
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinking
Is anything forever, or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good
I've been looking at where we're going
There's no slowing down to go back
And thinking of where we've been
No one's ever been given a road map
Say, "slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year"
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it moving, now, tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
Don't worry about anyone else

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good
I just wanna dance
I feel 

I'll be alright
Still I'm prayin' that you'll change your mind
I'll be okay
'Cause you'll come around eventually

Hey, hey, hey
When I love someone, I'm lovin' all the way
Hey, hey, hey
You know I'm the one to take you all the way

I know you hold back, but just let it go
'Cause I just won't stand to watch you walk alone
Don't be afraid, you're not on your own
As long as you know

We'll be alright
Still I'm prayin' that you change your mind
I'll be okay (Be okay)
'Cause you'll come around eventually

And I (Don't you worry, don't you worry...)
Won't tell you no lie (Don't you worry, don't you worry...)

Cause baby, you are stuck
You are stuck with me

I thank God every day for how you were made
Naturally engage, you don't need the makeup, no, no
Every given shape, I could illustrate
Your body on the page, I could not erase love, yeah

Won't tell you no lie (Don't you worry, don't you worry...)

You know I'm in this for life (in this for life)

Cause baby, you are stuck (stuck)

You are stuck with me

Open up the shades
Sun is on the 

A cup of coffee still steaming
Staring back at me and it’s blacker than the night now
I’m awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I’ll be alright (I won’t)
And I know it can’t get worse than today
Sitting here and she’s trying to rehearse what to say
See, she’s in the bathroom hoping I’m not in earshot
While she’s getting used to the sound of a teardrop (Splash)
It hits the tile
And I know it’s been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I’ve been in denial since it happened
Just take me to the past
‘Cuz I just can’t imagine losing you (too)
I can’t explain this so I’ll keep it all inside
Wear my pain, but it’s masked by my pride
She came to hold me and she cried
Told me this as she stared into my eyes, said

I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

I can’t, you won’t like what you see
If you were in my head and had to hear my plea
It’s like, I can’t believe this is happening to me
And could someone please shut this fucking answering machine
So I can start leaving these messages
That you will never get
And all these cries for help
You’ll never see and never check
But I guess it’s easy for you to leave me
But believe me
See this isn’t something that Imma just forget
I would trade it all for one more minute
Don’t you see I really need you to talk to
I’m still sitting here wondering who did it
While I’m staring out our front door
Knowing you’ll never walk through
Said you’d come right back
And now you’re gone like that
A blank stare as I stand so alone
And know you’re never coming home (damn)
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

I got a heart made of fool’s gold
Got me feeling so cold
You keep chipping away
All the promises that I told
Felt like I was on those
But keep slipping away
I want nobody else
But it’s hard to get to know me
When I don’t know myself
And it helps
Cause I felt
I was down, I was out
Then you looked at me now
And said
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave

I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so
