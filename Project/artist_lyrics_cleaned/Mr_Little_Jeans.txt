Ooooh
Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see
Ooooh
Until it's done
Oooooh
Your secret's safe with me

Blow out the candles on your cake
It's another year due with the same mistakes
Blind like a bat when you hit that wall
Now who's gonna come who you gonna call
Oh lonely man
You know you can
A pocket knife
Will serve you well
Remember what you're good for
There's much more to life

I can see you run
I can see you're undone
Shadow to the sun
Shadow to the sun
See a rule to break
See another rule to make
It's a good mistake
Shadow next to none

Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see

(Ooooh) Broken bones in the walking man
Under the sun
It's a trick to the eye, It's a rubber band
It's not what they can see
Don't let it go, Let it fall appart
Until it's done
It's heavy load, For a tender heart
Your secret's safe with me
Broken bones in a walking man
Under the sun
It's a trick to the eye

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling, again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Nothin at all
It meant nothin

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while i'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
Show her some beauty, before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot i'm still waiting
It's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cos it's Already past
Already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes i can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling, again
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes i can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling,
