We got Swamp vs....nigga why the fuck you ain't take me to Nutty Blocc?
This nigga a straight hoe, swear to God
This nigga took me somewhere pretty as a mothafucka
Security guard, picket fence and a gate code
You be in every fuckin' battle on every fuckin' card
Nigga, you think you can't be killed?
All this battlin' 'Back 2 Back', nigga you ain't learn from Meek Mill?
I wish you would get ya ugly ass up here and act like you know 'bout my past or somethin'
Somebody better get this nigga in the loop
You ain't the only one caught up in the system
I done gave the judge more hell than Minnesota Luke
So watch ya Tone, Bro
For the action, I'm a Fanatic, I let the heat wave in public
Will he survive or move on? Fuck it
Shit, I'd rather catch him traffic and let the paramedics on the Freeway judge it
We get it Geechi, you are a super duper Crip
But the fact that we know that you gon' rep' yo' flag to the death
Is only gon' make me make the .9 spray
Beyonce, push everything you had to the left
These niggas do not be street
That's why you able to get up here and get off easy
I'm really from South Carolina, do you know where Charleston is?
All them muthafuckas watchin'
Tonight, you really gon' have to talk Geechi
How the fuck did you win 2 on 2 then Champion Of The Year twice in a row?
With the same ole' one-two lines
And this nigga- you will not get this money back this time
Yo, you done already finessed two times
Talk about I walk around this bitch arrogant as hell
Wow
How?
Nigga I will always remain humble 'til I get my hands on that hundred thou'
And when I do, I promise you, I will not know how to act, like Bow Wow
These are cold facts
Remember when I said I would knock a nigga fitted off from a hundred yards with a rifle?
No cap
I brought that bitch back
And this bitch will hit a nigga chest from a distance
Nigga this shit got a trick switch
I wanna see a Crip flip, like the Special Olympics
Nigga you not finna do me like you been doin' these niggas from the old era
I even had a talk with the man upstairs
I prayed, God he (Gotti) know better
Rap nigga
He thought cause I rap 'bout the hood that I still live in the hood
Psst, that's what Swamp thought
If I'd have brung you to the hood and SMACK investment would've got killed, nigga that would've been my fault
Y'all think cuz a killer?
I will have yo' kids, beggin' for they life in front of me
Literally, make you and them take a knee
I don't give a fuck about this country nigga
I will break ya jaw, arms, legs, all ya joints
So close when I say it I could whisper, nigga I ain't gotta use all my voice
I'ma invade yo' space so much Minnesota Luke gonna want to deduct all my points
Nigga what you talkin' 'bout boy?
You ain't got no damn ops
Out the window of the Lamborghini with the AK, that was lamb (Lam') chops
Damn, fam' stop
I've been a threat
Nigga, you gettin' bodied and the battle ain't even finished yet
Everybody online like, "Swamp gettin' killed" and you ain't feelin' that
I'll take you outside and really peel ya cap
Now you can be the same nigga in real life as you is on the internet
Nigga let's get into that
How you gon' act Paige?
Huh?
I bet if I give you a 100 shots everybody witchu gon' act strange
After they see how many holes (hoes) on this bitch, ain't nobody gon' want back Paige (Back Page)
I'll slap Paige, into a coma, crack his side
Y'all will see the rib bend (ribbon) on Paige (page) like it's a diploma
Bitch you a goner
Smack, move to the side, just a little bit
Well, at least try to
Cause after this shot I guarantee Swamp land by you (bayou)
Don't lie fool
I'll fuck you up and you know it nigga
You ain't gotta say the truth
I'll beat yo' ass, knock you out and keep stompin' on Swamp 'til these Dolce's turn into gator boots
Nigga, I will hog tie you, throw you in the back of the whip
That's a Carolina nigga in the trunk like Rae Carruth
Did you catch that?
I go for blood once the check is paid
Nigga you better get yo' beneficiary in order
Cause this will be your death, Paige (page)
The TEC spray
I will kill you, Truth, DG, Chaos, all them niggas gon' die when I squeeze triggers
Just sayin', I got a box big enough to pack 12 (PAC-12) of you S.C. (USC) niggas
Man, I shot niggas and sold dope, when I was a kid there was nothin' cooler
My basketball coach was tryin' to figure out how I was known for bricks but yet and still they consider me a shooter
{Smack calls time}

If any one of you mothafuckas got a bond wit' Geechi, you better go ahead and bail on a nigga
Last time it was, "Fuck this clock cuz", then it was complainin' 'bout the time
Got me wonderin' if you would tell on a nigga
You sell hair my nigga
I sell, well, I prolly shouldn't say that cause that'll get me the wrong type of exposure
Let's just say, we both sell bundles
And both of our clients seem to come back lookin' for closure
My auntie cannot be trusted with the packs, she was a messy lady
My uncle back in the day had the PCP, that was that wet and wavy
You been 'round here walkin' crazy as a mothafucka
But I get it, URL catered to ya every fuckin' need, you got it good
Plus the fans love that you really from an L.A. set, not knowin' you Hollywood
I am not, nor am a gang member, I'm a gangsta, don't get it confused
I be with different sets too
Y'all know the Crest logo on the toothpaste?
First you see red, then the rest blue (blew)
This the part where everything gets throwed off
You might've beat my nigga Riggz (rigs)
But now you fuckin' wit' a nigga that's really in it for the long haul
You play stupid, and the gat gon' bang
Nigga, I'll put this fuckin' gun down and rock champion like Jakkboy Maine
Talkin' 'bout you gon' battle on N.O.M.E. two times in a row
Man, you sound like a fool muhfucka
Do NOT make me use this tool muhfucka
Let off a couple of shots
The first round went straight thru muhfucka
And the second round exit just like you muhfucka
His top down, this finna be some ruthless shit
New braids, grew some (gruesome) shit
This bitch here? Toxic, put you through some shit
The code word was "Geechi Gotti"
What that mean?
Absolutely nothing, and I hate this muhfucka do that stupid shit
Nigga if you didn't know, I could not wait to get here
The minute I heard these mothafuckas say I be gettin' gas, that shit immediately begin to fuck wit' me
Had me anxious, couldn't wait, rushin'
I done fuck around and drove off and took the pump with me
Y'all niggas think this nigga gangsta
Shit, 'til you get clapped
Y'all think I'm lost, I be walkin' through this street image like Google Maps
If you got somethin' to do, don't tell me how, nigga do it
If it's beef, I don't speak, I'm in the whip, ridin' wit' the toolie
I'm old school, I'd rather keep it in the streets like a '72 Caprice with no power steering fluid
Rap nigga

Y'all niggas know what the fuck goin' on
He up here rappin' all this dumb shit
Couple of weeks ago I literally had you under my wing like a drumstick
Nigga you, from South Carolina
That's where the Geechi's is really at
But you don't ever really mention that
You don't find it crazy that it took a nigga from Compton to put the Geechi's on the map?
Nigga what's up wit' that?
I'll grab a bat, break ya jaw 'til the bottom of it cover the roof
Now we can't understand shit you say when you talk, finally got you in touch with ya roots
Cuz what it do?
You know I really done dirt
My life I gotta convert
I'm at home cleanin' the pistol makin' sure the bullets Zoom
When I'm supposed to be helpin' wit' my son work
I got a .9 and a 9 year old, it's fucked up, I was taught how to raise my gun first
Nigga what's worse?
Gettin' robbed or the way niggas view you after gettin' robbed?
Answer once but think twice homie
I ain't gettin' robbed for shit, I wouldn't even let a nigga take advice from me
Mafia, bitch I'm wit' the mob
Extension, clip hang out all day like it need to get a job
Nigga you can pick the shots, but you don't get to pick the ops
Nigga you kill a nigga, that's when you get ya props
I pray for peace but I still spray the piece
That mean, yet and still, all my problems get sent to God
Nigga it's not a lot, of good options
Nigga do ya history
You either gon' change yo' life or get killed
Either way, niggas gon' view you differently
Nigga you ain't shit to me
The shit I rep come from within
I got niggas doin' life, they don't even count the days, they don't even know what fuckin' month we in
You a fuckin' kid
Portraying like you would bust that Glock
Sayin' you ain't scared to catch a case, knowin' you don't want that spot
On the yard walkin' wit' niggas who don't care about the time
Every day they be like, "Fuck that clock"
Nigga that's on 
Life is long but death is short
I'ma shoot 'til the MAC stop workin', now I really need tech (TEC) support
Nigga I'll shoot this shit for sport, I'm talkin' hella shots
Ya funeral? Ya casket look retarded, Swamp, that's a special box
Nigga, I went to jai- yeah for niggas that got killed with guns on 'em, I feel for 'em
I went to jail for a gun and got out, like jacks, I'm still armed
Nigga after that 100K, you know I'ma buy chickens and all the yams
Yeah nigga, I'm talkin' pounds
We gon' break 'em down
That's all I'm sayin'
And since they got Drake sponsoring the trap, nigga them is Aubrey grams (Graham)
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in his eyes
Nigga rap

You think I really don't know what's been happenin' lately?
That little pen/pencil of yours been lookin' mighty fuckin' dull
But you've been gettin' by with your charisma and Crip status
The night don't get shit backwards, ain't shit crackin' but ya fuckin' skull
You really dealin' wit' a certified street nigga who just so happened to be raised right
I got a good relationship with both grams
My uncle might've sold dope, but he also was a helluva baseball player
That nigga taught me you become more dangerous when you can pitch with both hands
This nigga let A. Ward kick his fuckin' ass
'Round my way we off reverends
Fuck a Christian, I'd rather apply a dome shot or use my knife as a cross reference
We are not 'round this mothafucka
I don't know if you lyin' 'bout how you sayin' you livin' in California
I just see you 'round this bitch walkin' 'round like you Debo
I'm willin' to bet you you won't try that shit with them niggas around the corner
Do you think I give a fuck if I'm in yo' state?
My respect, I'ma die to get it
I didn't really want to put a foot to this motherfucka face when he fell
But I'd be cappin'
Plus they say you ain't gotta lie to kick it
If you got yo' mind on that money, nigga you better dead it dawg
Before I let you rob my bank those Cleo motherfuckin' braids in yo' head, I'ma Set It Off
Fuck that 2 on 2
I'ma beat yo' fuckin' ass if you get up here actin' tough
They gon' say my partner got murdered by a cal' and Smack gon' prolly say I fucked the battle up
Do you think I don't understand how they look at this shit?
Another fuckin' battle between vets and rookies
Nah, this is a side bitch
Nigga ain't shit but extra pussy
Fuck yo' stories
I had a nigga that got shot five times, died and came back
To be real, that shit right there hurt me to even say that
Cause when he got out the hospital he wanted revenge
But the nigga that did it, caught a charge, went to prison and never came back
Now he walkin' round here and can't get his fade back
Plus, that's a helluva itch that you can't scratch
I met yo' baby mama last year and we had some great times
Now I didn't cuff her, I'm just sayin' we shared the same thoughts (thots) like great minds
Are you familiar with the Parallel Universe?
I bet it cuz
'Til you get killed with something blue steel and was made the same year that yo' set was
They thought I was gon' roll over and die
Bitch please
Nigga befo' that happen I'ma let this bitch squeeze
And they gon' find Geechi Gotti in the fuckin' Pacific ocean
And that's the only time I give a fuck about big seas (C's)
Rap
