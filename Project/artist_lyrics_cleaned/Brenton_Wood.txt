Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum
Boogum, now, baby, you're castin' your spell on me
I say, oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum
Boogum, now, baby, you're castin' your spell on me
You got me doin' funny things like a clown
Just look at me

When you wear your high-heeled boots
With your hip-hugger suit
Hah, it's all right, you're outta sight
And you wear that cute miniskirt
With your brother's sloppy shirt
Hah, I admit it, girl, that I can dig it
Well, then I says

Oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum
Boogum, now, baby, you're castin' your spell on me
I say, oogum, oogum, boogum, boogum
Boogum, now, baby, you're castin' your spell on me
You got me doin' funny things like a clown
Just look at me

Hah, now go on, now, with your bad self

Ooh
Hah
Ooh-ooh, my, my, my baby's cast her spells on me
Ooh-ooh, ooh, now, mercy, mercy on me

When you wear those big earrings
Long hair, and things
You got style, girl, that sure is wild
And you wear that cute trench coat
And you're standin' and posin'
You got soul, you got too much soul
I just says

Ooga-ga-boo-say, ooga-ga-boo-say
Ooga-ga-boo, now, castin' your spell on me
But I says, ooga-ga-boo-say, ooga-ga-boo-say
Ooga-ga-boo, now, castin' your spell on me
I says, ooga-ga-boo-say, ooga-ga-boo-say
Ooga-ga-boo, now, castin' your spell on me, woo
I says, ooga-ga-boo-say, ooga-ga-boo-say
Ooga-ga-boo, now, castin' your spell on me, huh
I says, I says, ooga-ga-boo-say, ooga-ga-boo-say
Ooga-ga-boo, now, castin' your spell on me
