My girl, she drinks and smokes, then she goes to fashion shows
Forth and back, back and forth, takes the (uh) just like a pro
Try to keep on up with her but really why bother
Girl's a super hottie plus she parties way harder
Still looking great with no make-up on
Keep going strong 'til the break of dawn
Eighth to the face, take it straight no chase
When she stay to the pace ain't a damn thing wrong
Mother, sister, brother they insist on drinking water
But she's sipping on some liquor, Janice Dickinson had taught her well
Hammered, you can hardly tell, stammered, but she hides it well
Hands up in the air and yells "Party all the time"
She dance around me in her thong, sing along, favorite song
Rip a shot, hit the bong, going all night long

My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time
My girl wants to...

Then she'll charge it to her card, whole bar, plus tip
Yeah for her and all her friends cause she never pays for shit
Kind of chick that you see on the t.v. (yeah)
Real high heels and her cleavage (yeah)
Rolling up some homegrown asking "Can we smoke some weed in here?"
Isn't like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls
And definitely ain't a lesbian but kisses other girls
Drives a car that isn't hers, keeps the keys up in her purse
Lipstick, red or pink, tell me which do you prefer?
Mini-skirts, exotic furs, wanna make the kitten purr
Try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours, cause she

Parties all the time, shorty she a dime
Ass like Nicki, Barbie in her prime
Stripping on that pole, shorty on her grind
I meet her in the bathroom, dog her from behind
It's the red cup sipping, Cîroc boy mixing
Bottles of that peach got that pussy all dripping
Line goes down the street, room full of bad bitches
Everybody super wasteful and them hoes is mad twisted
Asher Roth passed her off I had to ball, that ass was soft
I dribbled all on it like basketball
She nibbled all on it, I smashed I'm gone
It last through the morning and on through the night
11am I was off to a flight
Land in your city it's all of the lights
I got them hoes rolling like all of the dice

Yo, roll it up (roll it tight), hit it once (hit it twice)
Pass it round (pass it round) but don't roll the windows down
Let's box it out (box it out) and save the trees (save the trees)
We hoppin' out like the Mystery Machine
My eyes be the size of Mr. Miyagis
Squinting to read the fine print on the widescreen
We riding, riding and that's when I see
Headlights behind me, I then start to freak
Hide the weed, oh x4
You know I got it

Fuck everything you heard about
Your word of mouth ain’t worth a dollar
Verses vicious versatile, don’t you take it personal
Turn around, tell another person how I birthed your style
Now  I make you nervous, I’m superfluous, is this allowed?
This is child abuse, I’d beat my kid if he was you
Use the same switch that AP did
These nincompoops, no more cute
Fuck the rules, draft him next year too
This ain't fantasy, you pansy, get your Netflix queue
We on that next shit
Your best bet is to get 2 bedrooms with a pool
A nice view on lake and just move
Take the next few, digest, pack a couple bathing suits
Take your lady on vacation get away, just you two
Get a clue on what to do when in the presence of a fool
Never hesitate to set them straight, don’t get it misconstrued
It's a lesson how to dress when you don’t have a thing to prove
Ayahuasca and a headdress, resting in Peru

That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute

Slip and slide, sit inside
Had Xzibit pimp my ride
Pick her up at 8, but show up later, maybe close to 9
Won’t apologize, other things up on my mind
Like time is money, honey, hope you hungry even though you side piece
Chi tea, latte hot, looking like Ashanti
High for the first time, tell her that I mind read
Nah mean? Sitting shotgun, blowing shotties
Obiv top 3, so work that body, body
Don’t hurt nobody, my bonds diversified as my rhymes
Verses as hot as the mom of Steph Curry, c'mon
The broad side of a barn goes unharmed when you're on
Your arms as strong as I’m hurried
Like when Curtis through the first pitch
Worse then a nerve twitch
Controlling the motherboard, captain of the Mothership
The whirling dervish of this word shit
At my worst I’m perfect, at your girl’s nursing

That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute
That's cute, that’s cute, I ain’t fucking with you, but that's cute

That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Banker's Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

Man I love college, I love it

Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (You know what's going on)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You are all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)

Man, I love college
Do I really have to graduate, or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom
Do I really have to graduate
