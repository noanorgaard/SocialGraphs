Who's been where you are, wishin' all it was was sticks and stones
Those words cut deep, but they don't mean you're all alone
And you're not invisible
Hear me out
There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now
Someday you'll look back on all these days
And all this pain is gonna be invisible
Oh, invisible

So your confidence is quiet
To them, quiet looks like weakness
But you don't have to fight it
'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war
Every heart has a rhythm
Let yours beat out so loudly
That everyone can hear it
Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore
Oh, and never be afraid of doin' something different
Dare to be somethin' more

It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never woulda noticed if we'd never met
But everybody got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in

And every minute guessing, holding my breath you're fueling that fire

But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah

Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah

Because you're perfect girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Every little move and every little groove makes me sing
