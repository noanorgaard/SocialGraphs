Sometimes I wonder
What I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

Well, my mama and papa told me
“Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go a-riding next Sunday”
Well, I didn't go to work
Told the boss I was sick
“Now you can't use the car
'Cause you didn't work a lick”

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem
To the United Nations
Well, I called my congressman
And he said, quote:
“I'd like to help you, son
But you're too young to vote”

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime
