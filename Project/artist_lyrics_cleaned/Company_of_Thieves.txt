And ever since you came into my life
I always felt a little misled
I tried to read the signs, tried to stay in the lines
But shapes were always changing

Almost fooled me when you said, just

Sell your soul for someone's goal
Maybe then you'll have a friend
Go on, sell your soul to be controlled
Maybe then you'll have a friend

Everything we'll ever need is deep inside
Of our limitless beings
We struggle and we fight, 'cause it feels good
To wonder why our lives are happening
You might also like

Go on, sell your soul to be controlled
Maybe then you'll have a friend

Hid in your history, writ in your memory
Oh, you didn't know it's
Hid in your history, writ in your memory
Say you didn't know it

Sell your soul for someone's goal
Maybe then you'll have a, a friend
Go on, sell your soul to be controlled
Maybe then you'll have a friend

In the death of
The death of
The death of
