I saw you on a magazine marked "fashion" something
You looked too pretty to be true so I assumed it wasn't you
Tell me where you got all the courage from
Ignored by your best friends and your mom
I told you that you could do anything you wanted

You only walk on red carpet
Someday soon they're going to end
Twisting all tatterred
Your backward head will form its little plans
But you can't depend on anyone
You can't depend on anyone
It's not my fault
You won't love me if I'm not useful anymore

I saw you at a bus stop waiting for your boyfriend to get off
I wonder what kind of tool that he appears to be to you
You know you had me contemplate last month away
Thinking of what I would say
Stay away, you ruined me
You beautiful but fucking awful thing

You only walk on red carpet
Someday soon they're going to end
Twisting all tatterred
Your backward head will form its little plans
But you can't depend on anyone
You can't depend on anyone
It's not my fault
You won't love me if I'm not useful anymore

You used me as you do
You used me as you do
You used me as you do
You used me as you
