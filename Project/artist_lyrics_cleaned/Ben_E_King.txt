Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?

Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry

Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Woah, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by
