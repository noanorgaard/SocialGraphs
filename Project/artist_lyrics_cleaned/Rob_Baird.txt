Ain't nobody got a hold on me
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
Well I won't be swinging from your hanging tree
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
Been running like a dog for all of my life
And I guess I'll always be
Playing my cards in the dark of night
But ain't nobody got a hold on me
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh

Well I miss that woman with the lips so sweet
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
But there ain't no forgiving what she'd done to me
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
Caught her in the arms of another man
Just a liar and a goddamn cheat
Ain't nothin' like a gun in a jealous hand
But ain't nobody make a fool of me
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh

Oooh, hear it coming
Well they're never gonna let me be
Oooh, won't stop running
'Cause there ain't nobody got a hold on me
Ooh oh oh o oh oh oh

When the yellow moon's got her eyes on me
I said hmm-mmm-mmm
As I'm dragging my boots to the dead old tree
I said hmm-mmm-mmm
Mississippi river, delta sun
Pushing through the fog and the heat
I'll be washed in the water when the morning comes
And ain't nobody got a hold on me
Ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
 x2
Oooh, hear it coming
Well they're never gonna let me be
Oooh, won't stop running
'Cause there ain't nobody got a hold on me
I said ooh oh oh o oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh o oh oh
