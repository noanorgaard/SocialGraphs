I'ma clip these niggas in all venues
This where war gets you
Remember before the battle I asked you for that Wal-Mart job application...cause I'm 'bout to mop the floor witchu
And if you kick the bucket, my shift continues
I'm chefin' a body, if you don't get the menu
Well it's perspective prolly
The levels I be leapin' you can't reach to perceive it with a weak Wi-Fi receiver if your mental connection foggy
Copy?
It might make the message choppy
Damn near top secret- tell everybody
You the pick that pushed me
Why wouldn't I get my lick back? pussy
Backpacker
Who couldn't get to the duffle bag
We from the original SMACK chapter, App rapper
You make me look wack to have to tell a chick I'm battlin' Rum Nitty, Hitman backup
And her ask me, "Who that?" after
The fact that you're not even a factor to tear through
But this what God tier do, nigga
Die for even havin' the thought, I dare (idea) you
Act like you don't know who the truth is
This is exclusive
It get abusive, I even tried hittin' Ozempic, I won't lose it
You confusing the me that went to preach and give a speech
I weeded out the sativa leaf to get relief
They 'bout to see the end of cuh' (Indica)
He in Hell (inhale)
But Heaven knows (nose) he in my house, I'm just makin' him the center piece
Disrespectin' the penmanship, there's penalties
You just rhymes nigga, technique, ability
My scribes describe, breach what's discrete, disguised
I should get metaphysics, physically
You finicky
I put symmetry to the imagery
I'm tryin' to draw the line- nigga I'm out front like a Widow's Peak
You don't know a producer this hungry, I ain't skip a beat
Slap the Mario coins out this lyin' nigga teeth to jog his memory
They lined you up to dry and I'ma ring him out like a Sonic the Hedgehog injury
He on bended knee
I don't care if you write (right) more than spellcheck, nigga
You goin' under the wing like El Chapo findin' out no bail set (no bell)
The way you out here talkin' like a sales rep
You better be nice with them hands like a nail tech
I can smell threats, make it known
Rum, put the gin aside (genocide) it's 'bout to get worse than what Israel did to Palestine
He think he home
Til I dock the, spaceship by the taxi spot
The Alien out here lookin' like an astronaut
And can't nobody on the stream defend it
I seen your business it seems offensive
To think he pimpin', lettin' people pump this
"He's all about the culture"
What y'all deem commitment is interestingly enough, just a means of interest
I mean (Amin) your new found Ace was hot for you, fever pitchin'
'Bout how you, be assisting all the victims that's dyin' to get in the game
Bleedin' the benches, is this what they bumpin'?
But I'm a "clench the series" type of nigga though
Why I care about who on the sideline suckin' they teeth is clenchin'
Just for mentions
This some bullshit you tryin' to make a play off (playoff)
And it's gonna be season endin'
It's not a game nigga
You back slidin' out on payments
Skippin' out on obligations
You wasn't thinkin' 'bout how that other league event went?
Fees, expenses, deeds unmentioned
Uhhh, how the fuck they couldn't keep you locked in?
You ain't never been in a key position
Co-star, you just felt free to mention
That Troy gotta screen intentions, Beas' a witness
You gotta show Chico the cheat code on the cheat sheets you gettin'
But keep forgettin'
They think you makin' offers
No nigga you takin' orders, we work different
You gotta ask, I tell Smack what I need per mission (permission)
Ebony know
Harlem over everything (h.o.e.)
You'se a hoe, nigga
Yeah I hear y'all connection Bluetooth
All the while you tryin' to air (ear) the plug; stoop stoop
That's why I know she the only big Hustle you knew was in a sleeping bag with your Yogi Bear aye Boo Boo
You'se a Goof Troop
She said you ain't shit, but good at eatin' ass like it's in the food group
Cuz, you even did it while she was a SuWoo
Chill gang
I'm still neutral to this new truth
'Bout how you can't even keep it real yourself
You out here rockin' fake Jordans with the cheesy tags, that's what you do
You're usual
And you beat for cash not from YouTube, I'm gon' whoop yo' ass
Live Pay-Per-View proof
Gettin' home delivered
Mr. turn hopes to shivers, broke his vision
It'll line you like you folded picture
You thought this shit was all pretty waters, flowin' rivers
I'll walk a nigga down, it's motion sickness
Road collision
I'll knock the cool out ya bop nigga
Buckle his whole agenda
Tonight, yo' bitch gon' talk to you like an older sister
In sober centers
Somebody get over here and tell Hustle to hold her liquor
Nigga, are you Insane?
Tellin' me how I got a game
Of power that empowers, I let down my guard and trust 'em
It was after the Aye Verb battle I looked at you, you started blushin'
Comin' up to me, tellin' me how much I influenced your becoming
Yada yada, somethin' somethin'
I wanna thank you so much Beloved
Then you get in here and talk like you woke up out of a coma all of a sudden
It's fresh concussions, I'm just adjustin'
Cause I'm no florist, but I saw it, how you gave me my flowers with hidden colors
It's what I read (red), cause who doesn't? (dozen)
Like don't say (Doce), you don't say? But on the subject
History shows a rose'll (Rosa) will get you parked (Park) for frontin', nigga bust (bus) it
I texted you, "bet", what you read? B.E.T. or somethin'?
Entertain me or not man
When the pride on a Crippy's shoulders was all chippy but he iffy
It's sticky, Loaded on a card like a Giphy, he picky
As the NFL on Draft Day
When there's money in it but he feel he (Philly)
Could lose to every Buck in there (buccaneer)
I saw it knock the fun out of Gilly
Your chances,  Cate Blanchett
But plant as if they Pun/Biggie, ya dumb skinny
Hip Hop Is Real
I thought me and Mook set the bar when we discussed Remy
Nah, y'all talked all this Rum Nitty then brung Henny
How much can he metal with my reign (rain), I don't let the rust get me
Sun City, gang member
At heart you a fun hippy
Lookin' like Lil' Smitty with the drug kitty
I know a (Eric) Holder when I see one, you shitty cuz, really
I said I was gonna beat the diarrhea down this nigga leg
Aw man that's enough to freak out like a drunk Diddy
You just props for the desktop
And the mobile screens
Keyboard warriors on the social feed
I don't believe
I know my team
This shit get thick we gon' shake like Ovaltine
Nigga I don't believe, you into all that
Your war batch more matched line for line, you know, call backs
You a hard back, these dog scraps
Like the nigga I whipped before you but aye, these are the Car Fax (facts)
I've never seen you in a picture without a hat
Nigga you all cap
With the bald patch
That's a bar gap
Beloved 3 in stores too
And I drop joints on you like Ong-Bak
I will battle anyone on the card with this hand of Jesus nigga
Don't you ever throw rocks at the sun
(You can't reach it)

Aye! You an outsider
They said he was better when he went by "Pop", niggas couldn't out rhyme him
He was really outside every 'bout fightin'
So fuck a costume, this bitch gotta go back to bein' "Pop" like Ms. Doubtfire
Let me talk to the vulture that was once considered a leader but then got Hollywood on us
You spent most of your career dodgin' the soldiers, not givin' shots to opponents
You got lost in the moment
That's the reason why Rex, ICE and niggas like Hollow is GOATed
You wasn't even a warrior on your own league like Arsonal showed it
On camera he put on this act cause the audience on him
Don't keep that same energy when he Offset knowin' you fathered the culture (Kulture)
You got absent on ya seed
But only to return when you seen what battle rap actually could be
You like that deadbeat father that came back around when his son got drafted to the league
Let Pastor Nitty preach
Open up a chapter
How many of us lost brothers have you actually tried to save in real life knowin' that we damaged?
When you battled Tsu Surf did you pull him to the side and give him some of that knowledge?
Or was it only for the camera?
You playin' with us, we know
You would've thought a Harlem nigga that was Paid In Full like Ace would've tried to save him from that RICO
But it's only for the Cam'
How are you not ashamed?
Out here callin' niggas "bad fathers" like it's all a game
And we never seen you in the same room wit' yo' son; Mama Payne
Dawg a lame
He all for fame
Be off the 'cane
A coat thief
Shall I proceed (pro seed)? Bronny James
You do a lot of sucka shit, disguised as other men
Are you a Farrakhan, Brother Polite or Charleston White?
Cause I (eye) was wonderin', I don't fuck wit' him
You can't lie to me
Actin' like you some pro black activist on your Panther tip that fight for peace
Why don't you jump in all black, fight police?
You wasn't protesting for George Floyd
Our people really in dire need (kneed)
Open your eyes and see, he's a snake in fact
You need your spirit healed, I'm tryin' to fix pop's soul (popped sole), like a VaporMax
I hate ya raps
You do a lot of random shit
Against Calicoe it was a three piece and Jordan 12's
Nigga you can't match a fit?
You some tacky bitch
Nigga had on a suit and taxi's like The Pursuit Of Happiness
Savageness
This man be trollin'
He be gettin' up there lookin' like Huey Newton, niggas just laugh at Loaded
I don't know why the Black Panther went out like that on stage for (4); Chadwick Boseman
I have to smoke him
I'ma do him bad for y'all
I'm GOATed
So you gotta be one brave man Loaded, like a human cannonball
After all, what I now notice is takin' a picture of Calico's ass wild brodie
I had to tell him now
I figured the only reason you kept the file
Is cause you wanted to be down, Loaded (downloaded)
Wow brodie
You kept the pic and then you shared the shit
That make me think 'Everything Healthy' downlow, like a food pyramid
We got tools in the whip, on high alert
These switches? Illegal, you gotta know where to buy it first
Like fireworks
Most of the shit I got, not even allowed (a loud) Pop like these silencers
When it's time for work? Fuck a hater
I won't argue, I'ma pop the trunk for starters, like jumper cables
Mom at the gravesite cryin', "They took my baby"
At the tombstone, drop to her knees like The Undertaker
You fuckin' crazy?
What's the problem with niggas?
If we would've battled on a buildin' he would've probably quit it
I mean try fightin' and bow out, on the roof top like Lottery Ticket
Bombin' on niggas, this .40 open up
Stomach shot, 'Everything Healthy' spillin' out, it's a cornucopia
I'm smokin' cuz
I put a bullet in your top tight
I got a workout routine like Lux too, I do pullups at the stop light
You all hype, jump if ya want
I have ya body missin'
They haven't found cuz in a month, they persistent though
They ain't givin' up on the hunt
If you know anything about the Apollo stump, then your Lux (lucks) in the trunk
You'll get slumped
Most of your opponents, you 30'd (3-0)
But the last two won (2-1) Loaded
It's like comparin' 30 Nits (Nittys) to one Loaded
I told him, "I'ma grab the 30 clip to unload it"
You done Loaded
You don't believe me I'll show you
All three I'm goin postal
When it comes to the rooftop I got the Juice, I ain't even gon' hold you
I told you
You can't keep it real
