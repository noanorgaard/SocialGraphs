Look I got the feeling you been fiending my body
I see us leaving the party, now tell me what you gonna do
Somebody told me you been thinking about me
And I been thinking it probably could be me on you
So come on shawty we could creep into the bed
Get into some more freaky shit
Then we could go back to the crib
Take a look at how I live, take a sip
Let me show you how deep it get
Now we could do it real fast, we could do it slow
I like it when he make it last, 'till he gotta go
He like the way I move that ass, then I make it poke out
Then smoked out the Jag, then we on the roll
And took a ride down Lake Shore Drive, Stay so high
Flipping through the city, nigga ain no dye
Stay so fly, I could take your guy
Cause they know I got the bomb, and I ain't no lie

Because I know what we doing ain't right
And he be on me every time I see him
Because he know me and dude ain't tight
He wanna see me in the middle of the night
Wanna fuck in the middle of the fight
We break up to make up
But when we make love he suck, and he nibble, and he bite
But I know I gotta chill cause now I'm seeing that it's real

I'ma take it a little slower
Then speed it back up like Shaquille O'Neal
The back board, I'll break it, take it, never fake it, shake it
Run around my house butt naked
If you throw it good enough
Then daddy might buy your ass a tennis bracelet
'Cause I got so much dough, I don't know what to do with it
Plus I got so much dro, I roll it up and let you hit it
Lay back, way back, stay back
Like Puff take that, take that, take that
Young Bobby V. and Ludacris and Shawn
Will make you hit that playback, like four times, I'll co-sign
You so fine, L;et me hit one more time
