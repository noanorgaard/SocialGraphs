I don't know what, what
I was afraid of
I was afraid of

Monster take me somewhere
Where I can see my breath in the air
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Monster lead me home
You might also like
Now you surround, 'round, 'round me
Didn't think I could be found
Barefoot we tear through the streets
Don't touch the ground
A long way, way, way from comfort
Keep our backs to the cold
I need you now
'Cause I don't know how

I don't know what, what
I was afraid of
I was afraid of

Monster take me somewhere
Where I can see my breath in the air
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Monster lead me home

Oh, Monster take me somewhere
Where I can see my breath in the air
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadows
Monster lead me home
Monster lead me
