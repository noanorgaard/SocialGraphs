Stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Oh, damn"

So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes
But I, I'll ride that wave with you
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

Maybe all of this is simple
My heart's unconditional, yeah

We get so close
Kissing like Eskimos
It's a little bit much
I know, I do

Isn't she cra-crazy beautiful?
Isn't she stra-strange and wonderful?
And I think I love her more than I even understand

She got a classic style that's all her own
A smile you could hear through the telephone
And she says she's a rebel
But she's way too sentimental
And she's precious even when she's mad
Gets angry and I start to laugh
And I know that it's nothing
She's just pushing my buttons

Oh, still I never want anyone else

I've been waiting on the sunset, bills on my mindset
I can't deny they're getting high
Higher than my income, income's bread crumbs
I've been trying to survive
The glow that the sun gets right around sunset
Helps me to realize
This is just a journey, drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine

Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh, oh
And you can let your hair down, ay, ay
You gotta keep your head up, oh, oh
And you can let your hair down, ay, ay
I know it's hard, know it's hard

I got my hands in my pockets, kicking these rocks
It's kinda hard to watch this life go by
I'm buying into skeptics
Skeptics mess with the confidence in my eyes
I'm seeing all the angles, thoughts get tangled
I start to compromise my life and my purpose
Is it all worth it?
Am I gonna turn out fine?

Oh, you turn out fine
Fine, oh, you turn out fine

You're not the type, type of girl
To remain with a guy, with a guy too shy, too afraid
To say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who'll fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight beggin', beggin' you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try, try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart
But with you, you, you, I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start
And it seems that every time we're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you, that I don't wanna lose

I've been grinding so long, been trying this shit for years (Uh-huh)
And I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here
(Right here, uh-huh)
And if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain (Uh-huh)
But I've been sending up prayers and something's changed (Changed)

I think I finally found my hallelujah

I was old news, I went cold as cold could be (Uh-huh)
But I kept throwing on coal tryna make that fire burn (Uh-huh)
