So, this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails

You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you wanna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?
Oh


Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me, uh-huh
No right, no wrong, selling a song, a name
Whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda
Oh, yeah

"Sell me, sell you," the porpoise said
Dive down deep now, to save my head
You, I think that you got the blues, too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the Western fools
Silly, silly fools

The real thing don't do the trick, no?
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Oh, Barra-Barracuda
Yeah

Ooh, 

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh

How do I get you alone?

Alone


We may still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the Devil and the kids keep coming
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doing all right
There's nothing left to do tonight

But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy
Crazy on you, oh

My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early light

And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
And my love, the pleasure's mine

Crazy on you, oh

Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ooh

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy
Crazy on you
I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
Sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love

Crazy, yeah
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy
Crazy on you, oh
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy
Crazy on you, yeah

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy
Crazy on you,
