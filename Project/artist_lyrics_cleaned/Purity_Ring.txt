You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

There was no light and I swear
I could see your raring fear
I heard the plains moaning back
I saw the thunder roll o'er black
There was no light and I swear
We sat still in our fear
Make a ladder of what folds
And climb up in me
You might also like
You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

(And I) carve out the spaces
(And I) imparted graces
(And I) I couldn't shake it
(And I...)

I built a constellation lair
Out of the moles that hovered there
A fever billowed with the wind
And I bade the sky therein
I built a constellation lair
Out of the moles that hovered there
Make a pardon of what knows
And climb up in me

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go
You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the veins grow in slow
You push and you pull but you'd never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let 

Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't

There is a color that shines through your skin
Like the moon on the wind, when I dare bear you in
The night is full on behalf of your evaded mask
And the rings 'round your eyes

We are stranger than Earth, with her seasons misled
Stronger than her moods
When our parts parted, she bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you

Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't

There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams where I knew
Woken in a fog, don't sweat it
And reckon none of it had come from you

Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week might our weakness elude

There was a stagger that shifted my hips
Oh, how swiftly it shook the dew from my lips
There was a danger that seeped from my skull
How it dripped on us all, but it wasn't your fault

We are stranger than Earth, with her seasons misled
Stronger than her moods
When our parts parted, she bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't, I wasn't
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you

I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
Again, again, again, I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you
I wasn't thinkin' 'bout you, I wasn't

And we break downstairs with our fevers in the air
I forgot to ask how I lonely left them there
How thick it sits and why your eyes glare
How thick it sits and why your eyes glare

Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week might our weakness 

Tell me that you wanna move me 'round like that
I will watch your lips curve in a smooth combat
Make your way in through my tears and I'll relax
If you're the truest one, I'm gonna make you a season

Climb up in my rattling spine and I'll contract
Tell me I'm the only one and I'll move back
If you see your daydreams in me, they'll not lack
What's been weighted in me, I'll make you quake with reason

Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

I can feel your knees sinking into the bed
Searching in my dark eyes to break what's been said
There's a wave of grace hunting your soreness down
There's a light in my skin that's been dimmed

I'ma dig you up and give you what I took
Pull you up and tuck you in and make you look
I'ma smooth your shoulders down and calm what's shook
It was all forlorn, if only for a season

Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray
It was all forlorn, if only for a season

Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Watching me is like watching a fire take your eyes from you
(Watching me is like watching a fire)
Hope it isn't repetition
Though that's the only thing that keeps and takes you

Even though it's the only thing that keeps and takes you
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay
Hey, hey, pray, pray, pay

Don't forget the way she pushed the water inside
Wading through the spirits like a flood on the floor
Don't forget, forget, don't forget, forget

She took your face and called it her choir
Knitting lace out of lashes powdered with ashes, oh, oh, oh
She held your hands and told you to wonder
How you'd fit in the land if the waves held you under, ah, ah, oh

I'll cut the soft pockets, let bleed
Over the rocky cliffs that you leave
To peer over and not forget what feet are
Splitting threads of thunder over me

That I might see with my chest and sink
Into the edges 'round you
Into the lakes of quarries that brink
On all the edges 'round you, 'round you, 'round you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
The lungs of me be crowns over you
Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
The rungs of me be under, under you

Emitting all its graces through the pores
You make a fine shrine in me
You build a fine shrine in me

That I might see with my chest and sink
Into the edges 'round you
Into the lakes of quarries that brink
On all the edges 'round you, 'round you, 'round you

Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
The lungs of me be crowns over you
Get a little closer, let fold
Cut open my sternum and pull
My little ribs around you
The rungs of me be under, under 

Take a break, take me down, take me down there
I wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years
Take a break, take me down, take me down there
I wanna stare at your tears, how they

I, I, I lied, now I'm lying awake
I, I, I cried 'til my body ache
I, I, I lied, now I'm lying awake
I, I, I cried 'til my body ache

You sweat, and you bled
I couldn't look cause your body, your body would shake
And you feared a lonely death
Like a lake leaves you alone in her depths

Take a break, take me down, take me down there
I wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years
Take a break, take me down, take me down there
I wanna stare at your tears, how they—
