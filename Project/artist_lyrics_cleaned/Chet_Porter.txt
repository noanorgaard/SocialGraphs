I don’t know why but I think I like all you’ve put down
Something in the way that you say it’s alright to want you now
And I want you now

There is some kind of light in those eyes
And you've got me
Is this all I can say every time I get close
And I feel your fade, but you've got me

All that I know is I want you to stay
Stay around
Something in the way that you say it's alright
To want you now
And I want you now, now
Yeah, I want you now
And I want you now
And I want you now
You might also likeAll that I know is I want you to stay
Stay around
Something in the way you say it's alright
To want you now
And I want you
