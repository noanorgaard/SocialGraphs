Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey, Diane, let's run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please"

Say uh, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Say, oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on

Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we oughta run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' a thing"

But Jacky say uh, "Oh, yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"
Oh, yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic, that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I wanna be

Anxiety and sorrow
Underneath my skin
Self-destruction and failure
Have beat my head in

Hey, 

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

The winter days, they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth
Couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say do you remember when?

I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong

Got a few kids of my own
