Love (love), joy (joy)
I need space (love)
I need me (action!)
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're going to have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't want to be so damn protected
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected
I'll tell them what I like, what I want, what I don't
But every time I do I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize
I'm overprotected

Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

Took the boy off the dance floor, screaming in his ear

We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change)

The girls roll up (Windows roll down)
Eyes on us (Jaws on the ground)
Watch them go (Wow, it's just so funny)
Like bees to the honey

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty

Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change)

Pour the drinks, bring the noise

All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Oh yeah)
We're just so pretty (Pretty)
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance (Ooh)
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time, Iggs

What's up, Britney? (Uh-huh)

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty (Pretty)

Jump the line, to the front

I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
