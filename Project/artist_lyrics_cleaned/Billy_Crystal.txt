I'd live in a penthouse
In a room with a view

And if I were handsome

No way!

It could happen
(sung)
Those dreams do come true
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin'...

Can I tell you something?
For years I have envied—
You might also like
You're green with it

—Your grace and your charm
Everyone loves you, you know?

Yes I know, I know, I know

But I must admit it
Big guy, you always come through
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothin' to me...
Nothin' to me

Yeah I wouldn't be nothing (No!)
If I didn't have you to serve
I'm just a punky little eyeball
And a funky optic nerve
Hey, I never told you this
Sometimes I get a little blue
Looks good on you

But I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

Let's dance!

Haha!
Look Ma, I'm dancin'! Would you let me lead?
Look at that, it's true, big guys are light on their feet!
Don't you dare dip me, don't you dare dip me, don't you dare dip me!
... Ow, I should've stretched!

Yes, I wouldn't be nothing, if I didn't have you

I know what you mean Sully. Because—

I wouldn't know where to go

Me too. Because I—
Wouldn't know what to do

Why do you keep singin' my part?

I don't have to say it

I'll say it anyway

'Cause we

Both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have... you

One more time!
It worked!

I don't have to say it

Where'd everybody come from?

'Cause we both know it's true

Let's take it home big guy

I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have
You
You, you

A–E–I–O!

That means you!
