The sunlight was just right, you had a crown of daisies
The song was so long that it made the crowd go crazy
The band was singing, la la la la la
For the flower children dancing in the sky

Mom and dad got high in the 70s and
They found some pot to plant a little seed in
Made a flower child, picking petals
Singing, "Love me, love me not"
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild
You little flowerchild

The moonlight was too bright, it glistened on the lake and
That was the first time I ever saw you naked
You had me singing, la la la la la
Just two flower children dancing in the night

You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof
We'll be fireproof

Did you know you and me
Must be fireproof with all these flames between our sheets
When all our lovin' was almost gone
Made some in the moonlight, yeah, before the dawn (Hey)
Made it out of the heat
Crossed the desert and we sailed the seven seas
When all our lovin' felt so wrong
Found out all the hard times just made us strong

I turn to you, you’re all I see
Our love’s a monster with 2 heads and one heartbeat
I turn to you, you’re all I see
Our love’s a monster with 2 heads and one heartbeat
We just got caught up in the moment
Why don’t you call me in the morning instead?
Before we turn into a monster
Before we turn into a monster with 2 heads

I hope to god I’ll love you harder
I hope to god I’ll love you longer
If only I could live forever
If only I could hold you longer

There must be something in the water
And there must be something about your daughter
She said our love ain’t nothing but a monster
Our love ain’t nothing but a monster with 2 heads
