Bruh, I keep  10 ice cubes in my pockets
Unlike Judah I don't put forks in sockets
My children are boiled, and my dog needs spoiling
I'm a chad so I listen to classical
I broke your mother's clavicle
I'm a pro the rank I got is iron
Bruh, my dog's name is Brian

Yeah
Oooh
Its true
What do I got to say
Its true
You might also likeI got diabetes I'm dead (it runs in the family)
That's so sad, I gotta go to bed
Yeah
I look outside and I get spied on with infared (it was a mistake, i swear)
They told me free candy and I got misled (oh no)
Put all my cleaning supplies and make mustard gas
It smells so good
The next thing I do is pass
Referencing my homies man I got so much class (yeah)
Hand it over to Nobe

Yeah, you know Nobe's back on the track again
Rapping with Ulty, Cl*rk and Albert Chen (ay thats right)
All my homies in the dark after 10 (10)
You think you read fast but I'm on chapter ten

Everyone knows I love Chester
But did you know she's an investor
I got me some forces so she's crying in the bathroom
Crying about how much her head hurts
Went to the store to look for some meat
Then I saw a big foot
Looking at his feet
Mad at look me the third time this week
She said she had to go get me some cheese
Haven't seen her since I think it was a tease
Drowning in the toilet, suffering from the past
Man all I do is drown and be in the sigma cast (its true)
I ran into a wall feeling dislexic
Next thing I know I'm getting sick
Yeah

All you mother truckers telling fairy tales (yeah)
All my mother truckers getting females (not me)
Me and my boys in New South Wales (wales)
Me and my boys all Sigma Males (nah yogurt)
Ay you know what
Let's switch this up
Let's do it
Okay
Okay

Yeah I'm Bert
I never get hurt
I'll put you in the dirt and desert you
As I assert my overt dominance
I live in full prominence
It is so ominous
You have urinary incontinence
My voice has an amazing continence
That's right, I'm musically talented
Your mom got patented
I inhabited Tilted Towers
It gave me Fortnite powers
We stay hungry, we devour
Put in the work, put in the hours
And take what's ours
I love Fortnite Battle Royale
I put in the pressure like the Pascal
You see me everywhere, I'm in the Panama Canal
You are so dumb, you have no rationale
My career is an astonishing success
Making progress with finesse
You're playing checkers, I'm playing chess
Your brain is so small, it has regressed
By the way, I know your address
He knows my address
Gonna dox you right on the spot, what can I say
Your career is over (its over)
I'm the inspiration to all, me
