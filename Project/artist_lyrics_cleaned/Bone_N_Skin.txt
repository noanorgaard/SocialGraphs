But to your dismay, this isn't your day
For the happy fun time has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
I am alive, immortalised
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey, there's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long

All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'

The Lonely Island:
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty-year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be carefulo
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These *****es know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young ***** on the corner, *****, I had to serve *****
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my ***** a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans ***** and man, that ***** voodoo
And I'm that ***** now

You got me jumping like
Saigon:
I used to walk uptown to see Mario
That ***** sold more **** than the young Harry O
From Punta Cana to Ghana to Ontario
He made it snow all over the whole barrio
His lil' brother Luigi, he was a real *****
He took mushrooms, they used to make him feel bigger
His job was to pick up the **** like a pooper scooper
And drop it off without gettin caught by the Koopa Troopa
One day they hit Mario on the jack
Told him they had his *****, want a hundred stacks to get her back
He thinkin "What kind of **** is that?
This ain't a video game, lame, we finna go tit for tat"
He lit his cigarette, took a drag of the cancer smoke
And with this hit, he burnt a hole in the ransom note
Then he wrote with ease and I quote
"Y'all must really want one of these in your throat"

After the battle, masterless cattle
Overlords hanging by a thread
With a bit of bravado, maybe tomorrow
We'll be atop the heap
While the rest of Hell's ****ing
Alastor's missing
Fled with his tail between his legs
Nature abhors a power vacuum
It leaves room for you and me
The future of Hell belongs to the Vee's
This place reeks of death, there's a chill in the air

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope
