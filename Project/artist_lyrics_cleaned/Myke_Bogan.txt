Hello you stupid motherfuckers that been hatin' on me
Time is money so I hope you got that lasik on me
Surgery perfectly, come be the patient for me
I'm purchasing purple trees, got some papers, homie
And I been feelin' it, I got a buzz buildin'
I got some pills again but I'm not drug dealin'
Summertime sadness so you know we gon' experiment
I think I'm done dabbin', I had a bad experience
Started out laughin', just passin', it was typical
Trippin mic, smokey in the back of Debo pigeon coop
And I'm still smoking, yes I know this shit is pitiful

So now it's me and the devil on the dance floor
So dance, whore, 'till you feel your spine'll tap
Hoes start to glance more when they see designer cash
Shootin' up with the needle that'll play the vinyl track
And then I bang the Beatles 'till the time has passed
Damn, while I'm thinkin' of my future, I've been copin'
Keepin' options open, still chokin' while I'm smokin'
Humble keeps me balanced, so I'm really tryna to focus
And I haven't even spoken 'bout these labels takin' notice
I'm ooon six beers, one joint, and a cigarette
And I haaad six beers, one joint, and a cigarette
