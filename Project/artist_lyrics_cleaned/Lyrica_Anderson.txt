If I said I want it
If I said I need
If you really got it
Give it to me please
(Verse 1)
I ain’t stutter at all
We can do it right up in the back of the car
Got me on my knees up in the back of the Rolls
I love it when your teeth are filled with diamonds and gold
I’ve been waiting all night
Thinking ‘bout it all day
If you hit it all night
We could go the long way
(Hook)
‘Cuz I’m, so into you
You got the juice, you got the juice
‘Cuz I’m, so into you
You got the juice, now what we gon’ do
(Chorus)
If I said I want it
If I said I need
If you really got it
Give it to me please
If you give me good love like that
Bet I’ll give you good love right back
Can I get some good love like that
Give it to me please
You might also like(Verse 2)
I ain't faking at all
When you put it on me you be setting it off
All between my legs up in the back of the club
And even if they notice know we don’t give a fuck
(Hook)
‘Cuz I’m, so into you
You got the juice, you got the juice
‘Cuz I’m, so into you
You got the juice, now what we gon’ do
(Chrous)
If I said I want it
If I said I need
If you really got it
Give it to me please
If you give me good love like that
Bet I’ll give you good love right back
Can I get some good love like that
Give it to me please
(Bridge)
I’ve been waiting all night
Thinking ‘bout it all day
If you hit it all night
We could go the long way
I’ve been waiting all night
Thinking ‘bout it all day
If you hit it all night
We could go the long way
(Chrous)
If I said I want it
If I said I need
If you really got it
Give it to me please
If you give me good love like that
Bet I’ll give you good love right back
Can I get some good love like that
Give it to me please
(Outro)
If I said I want it
If I said I need
If you really got it
Give it to me please
Give it to me please
Give it to me
