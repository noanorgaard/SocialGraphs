Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together, we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be
(Turn around)
But every now and then, I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you
(Turn around)
Every now and then, I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then, I fall apart

And I need you now tonight (And I need you)
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight (If you love me)
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right (And we'll never)
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero (Hero)
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life

Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Ah, ah

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, blood)
I need a hero (Hero)
