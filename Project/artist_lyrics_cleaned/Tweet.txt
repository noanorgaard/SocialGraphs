Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid, but this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride, let it ride, and partied
But this body felt just like mines, I got worried
I looked over to the left; a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be?
