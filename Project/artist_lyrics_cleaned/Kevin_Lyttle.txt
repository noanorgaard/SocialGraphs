And you're winin' on me
Pushing everything, ah
Right back on top of me, yeah
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home

Let me hold you
Girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you
Girl, wine all around me
You got me going crazy, you
