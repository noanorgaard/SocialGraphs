You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
And in the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"

And then you had enough and you took that ring off (Oh yeah)
You took that ring off (Oh yeah)
So tired of the lies and tryin', cryin', fightin'
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins (Oh yeah)
Dust yourself off and you love again (Oh yeah)
You found a new man, now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear, mama

Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts

Part II: ***Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)

I wanna say I lived each day until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here

I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere

And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm workin'
When I need attention, I tend to nag

Don't slow it down, just let it go

Eyes wide open, can't you see?
