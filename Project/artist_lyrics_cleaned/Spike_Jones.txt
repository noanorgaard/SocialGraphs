All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
And I could wish you
Merry Christmas

It seems so long since I could say
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"
Every time I try to speak
All I do is whistle

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
You might also likeGee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
And I could wish you
Merry Christmas

Mama!
Mama!

Good old Santa Claus and all his reindeer
Heh, they used to bring me lots of toys and candy
Gee, but now when I go out and call Dancer, Prancer
Donner and Blitzen, huh, none of them can understand me

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth
Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
So I can wish you
Merry Christmas
Christmas
Christmas
Aw, for goodness sakes
Happy New
