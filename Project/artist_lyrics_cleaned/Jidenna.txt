Oh Bambi I won't lie
If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it's my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

Bambi Bambi (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear, my dear, my dear (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
My dear I want you here (Ahh Bam-Bambi)
But don't get too near for there’s lions beware (Ahh Bam-Bambi)

Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
‘Cause now they know you are love of my life

I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between loving many and loving one
I got the wedding invitation Bambi
I'm happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church there screamin’ your name Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi

We walk through that village square and broken glass is everywhere
People pissing in the stairs, they hang their head down in despair
We are here, we are here, they can feel it in the air
We are here, we are here, we are so extraordinaire
Round the way they did appear some debutante and debonaires
Well at least that's what it seemed 'til we shot clouds up in the air
We are rare, we are rare, Momma told us we are rare
We are rare, we are rare, we were born extraordinaire
