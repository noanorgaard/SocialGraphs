An empy defendant’s seat
A visitor’s gallery with nothing but junk
Come, let’s begin
This farce called a trial

“Only one of the vessels that we’re seeking out
By orders of god remains
If it’s the case you know its whereabouts
Make your testimony, “Sorceress of Time””
“Transcending time, changing forms
Changing masters
It’s already made its debut on stage”
Even so, not knowing
The whereabouts myself, right now
I fear it’s probably in her hands"

“Search, search, search that bitch
Left or right or down
The who holds all the keys
Search for “The Master of the Hellish Yard””

“Until when is this farce going to continue?
There is nothing after that”
“Spirit of Adam who fell in
There’s nothing you can accomplish anymore”

Swinging scales, a disordered scenario
Vessels sullied in sin
Each song playing their song their own way
A discordant capriccio
The story already let go
Of demons' and gods' hands and walks alone
If they were in this place
They would probably say this lamen
What was truly terrifying
Was the desire of humanity

“Let’s sort what few facts we have
Lowly man descended from a demon
I shall give you permission
So tell us of the time you came to this forest”
“Dwelling in my body is an unpleasant curse
Seeking my original ancestor’s sword
That has become necessary to solve this
I arrived at this forest alone”

Kill him, eat him, if impossible, let’s arrest him
This insolent jackass who entered the forest
Judge, judge, at any rate judge him
Trial! Sentence! Death!

“When I resolved myself after I was arrested
The fickle girl extended her hand”
“I wanted a charge just right for doing chores”
“And so I became “The Gardener””

“Sorceress of Time” “Cursed Gardener”
Substitutes for the unawakened vessels
Each keeping their goals close to the chest
The unsettling invaders
“The Director Doll”
“Master of the Graveyard”, “Gear”
“The Waiter” “Master of the Hellish Yard”
When the end of everything arrives
Who will be laughing, I wonder?
Lu li la lu li la lu li lu li la
The resounding beat of Irregular

Friendship, trauma, justice, illusion
Hope, destruction, dreams, greed, love, death
All of it continues to melt and turn
In this Clockwork Lullaby
Just before the solitary man’s death
He constructed a theater
Will the utopia he wished for
Be completed?
Come, let’s see with our own eyes
This farce called

You know I'm tired of living like a ghost
God only knows I've given more than most
I cover up scars that emptiness has caused
When the chemicals take, will it be me you dream of?

There's a heartbeat somewhere
Love, I'm gonna find you there
In the darkness, sleepless
Love, I wanna have you near
We never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone

You shake me up the moment before sleep
You're calling out the demons inside me
And when they're gone, the hours I'm awake
I take these pills and pray to god they'll take

All my life I’ve been a star

A melody pure and a rhythm loud
