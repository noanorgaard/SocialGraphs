With your gun and your billie claw
Why do you look so mad?
You always look so fucking angry
But you should be happy
And you should feel good to be
King of the neighborhood
You're the king of the neighborhood
Officer, officer, officer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Officer, officer
Oh, please, don't hurt me, sir
Officer, no
Well, I saw you in the forest
And you made me take off my clothes
Why did you get so mad?
Why don't you buy yourself a story
And give up your badge
And give up your company
Give up your company, I gotta give up my company
Oh, no, I'm moving slow
'Cause I'm stopping, I'm on my own
Oh, no, I'm in the road
I see you watching from window
