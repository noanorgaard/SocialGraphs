But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note-me as your friend (Oh)
Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favourite little scene
Oh, oh, oh

I get carried away, carried away, from you
When I'm open and afraid
'cause I'm sorry, sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout things that I've said
I always let it get to my head

Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to

It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
(higher, higher, higher, higher...)

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colours of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong?
How come it takes some people so damn long?
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling

Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

No one needs to know we're feeling

And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
And of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead

Go ahead

But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

Honey, it's your son, I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And, tonight, I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
