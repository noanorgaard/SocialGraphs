Crowd of people always gather
Play a tune that'll last forever
Come correct, come sweet not bitter
Take the load off move your shoulder
That time again, check your conditioning
Looking at life and the passion you're finding
Without fail hit the head upon nail
Let me see your eye, remove the veil
Got the ital, for the ital jockey
Make a motion for the gal pick me
Looking for a rider then come see me
Looking for a rhythm D1 bless me, whoa!
Up the dance now jump on a table
Vibe me ah send till the people get full
Come work it off till your body get fit
Move to the top of the list
We give them reasons (reasons )

Testify, come raise your hand
Make a face from sound system
Touch the sky from elation
Fade away all commotion
Testify, come raise your hand
Make a face from sound system
Touch the sky from elation
We give them reasons (reasons Embed
