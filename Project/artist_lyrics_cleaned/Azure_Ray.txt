I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep

Now these years locked in my drawer
I'll open to see
Just to be sure

I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep

And so I'm reaching out for the one
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light
As it tints the shade of you
Hold my wine, hold it in
Nobody's lost
But nobody wins
You might also like
And I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep

And so I'm reaching out for the one
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light
As it tints the shade of you

I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep
I can't speak to you

I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep
I can't speak to
