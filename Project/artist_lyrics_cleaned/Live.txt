Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall

Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes, pale blue-colored iris
Presents the circle, puts the glory out to hide, hide

Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it

Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind

I can feel it
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel 

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now

Pinned down and abused for bein' strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone, for me all day

Alone in the church by and by
To cradle the baby in space
And leave you there by yourself chained to fate, yeah
