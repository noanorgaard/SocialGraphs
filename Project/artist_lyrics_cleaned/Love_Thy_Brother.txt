Don't leave me without saying something
Don't make this out to be nothing

I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight
And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right (Love me better)
Just take me where home is tonight (Is tonight, is tonight)

Can't be insincere
You know what we have here
I think it's pretty clear
Not afraid to say
That I don't want to play
I'm tired of this game

Don't leave me without saying something
Don't make this out to be nothing

I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight
And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right (Love me better)
Just take me where home is tonight (Is tonight, is tonight)

The sun is coming up tonight
I see the look in your eyes
I don't wanna waste my time

Let's not take this for granted
You know where I stand
So just do what you want
It's your last chance before I leave
I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight
And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right
Just take me where home is
