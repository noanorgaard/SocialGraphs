In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
When all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am

You love me, but you don't know 

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, woah, woah

Oh, oh, 

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still, your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, 

'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in
