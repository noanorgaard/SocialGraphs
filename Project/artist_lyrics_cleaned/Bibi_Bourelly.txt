And I won't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give a fuck
Won't ever, ever, ever give a fuck

You won't bring me down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down, down, d-d-down
You won't bring me down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down, down, d-d
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up, oh Lord

They want me to be this picture-perfect girl
In a little picture-perfect world
But I cuss when I talk, and I lean when I walk
And I've been through some shit and I've gained and I've lost
And all of the teachers used to keep me after the class
Behind the school bleachers suckin' on cigarettes
I'm out of the norm since the day I was born
And I put this on life, I won't ever conform
You might also like
I won't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever give a fuck
Won't ever, ever, ever give a fuck

You won't bring me down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down, down, d-d-down
You won't bring me down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up

Went from high school to Hollywood
From Hollywood to stadiums
From stadiums to the whole wide world singin' my song along
Berlin to Tokyo, Egypt to USA
If you're still holdin' on, let me hear you say

You won't bring me down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down, down, d-d-down
They won't bring you down, down, d-d-down
Down, d-d-down, down, d-d-down
Oh they got you fucked
