Time don't fool me no more
I throw my watch to the floor, it's gone crazy
Time, don't do it again
Now I'm stressed and strained
Anger and pain in the subway train

(Now it's half past two)
Long gone the rendezvous
(Now it's half past three)
Time made a fool out of me
(Now it s half past four)
Oh baby, can't you see?
(No use in waiting no more)
It's a timing tragedy

I think it's nine when the clock says ten
This girl won't wait for the out of time, out of time man
