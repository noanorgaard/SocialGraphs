Oh, it'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I knew then what I know now
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
Ohoh, ohoh, ohoh
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
'Cause then I wouldn't need to spend my whole life
Catching up to you

But I held a seashell
Close to my ear
I listened
To the sound of the deep
It made me swear
An oath of secrecy
I couldn't tell a soul what it told me

It'd be better if I knew then what I know now
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
The shallows, the shallows
It made me swear
An oath of secrecy
I couldn't tell a soul what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me,
