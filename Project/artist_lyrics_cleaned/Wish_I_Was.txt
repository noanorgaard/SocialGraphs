I'm up with the sun,
Always on the run,
And you are the night,
The shadows in the light
:
We move so fast, we're motionless,
We were meant for so much more than this,
I'll always stay,
If you won't slip away
:
I can't deny,
You pull me in like gravity,
And stars collide,
Something takes a hold of me,
Wrong or right,
Meant to be or meant to end,
Here we are again,
Here we are again

:
Fall down from the sky,
Just in time to rise,
Waves crash with the moon,
Washing over you
:
We move so fast, we're motionless,
We were meant for so much more than this,
I'll always stay,
If you won't slip away
:
I can't deny,
You pull me in like gravity,
And stars collide,
Something takes a hold of me,
Wrong or right,
Meant to be or meant to end,
Here we are again,
Here we are again,
Can't deny,
You pull me in like gravity,
And stars collide,
Something takes a hold of me,
Wrong or right,
Meant to be or meant to end,
Here we are again,
Here we are again

:
I can't deny,
You pull me in like gravity,
And stars collide,
Something takes a hold of me,
Wrong or right,
Meant to be or meant to end,
Here we are again,
Here we are
