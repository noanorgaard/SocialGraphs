It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice
Baby, oh baby baby baby

Listen
I've already been thinking about you on my mind
Far too often for you to be here at this time (Baby)
You see, one hands on mine, and the others on my thigh (Oh, baby)
Oh, baby
Look, I already played with the idea of you
Being here in the morning (Mmm, baby)
And the position for the crack of dawn (Mmm, baby)
And the conversation before the yawning (Oh, ah, baby)
But aah, it's getting late (Oh, baby)
It's getting late

Oh, baby, baby, baby

How's about I let you touch the space
That you left behind (Oh, ah, baby)
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling (Oh, ooh, baby)
But now we're talking (Mmm, baby)
Touching, almost making sensual again (Oh, oh, oh, baby)
We can taste the familiar (Oh, mmm, baby)
Cause, the family hour supports it of this moment (Oh, oh, baby)
But was led by the movements (Oh, oh, baby)
'Cause ah, it's getting late (Mmm, baby)

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (You say) don't be

Oooh, baby

I see the memories we replayed (Mm, baby)
Same space, face, bodies

I know there's a method to your manliness (Oh oh, baby)
But ah I'm a afraid

Watching, needing, wanting me

I'm afraid that you're gonna hurt me baby, baby
Twice baby, good baby, baby, baby
Twice baby, oh, baby, baby
