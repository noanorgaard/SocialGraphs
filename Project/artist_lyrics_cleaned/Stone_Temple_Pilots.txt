Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

How far will you go I say
Just to bait a mouse?
Shorter lived and longer gone
Can you figure out?

Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

Have you lost your sister, girl?
She's all but blown away
Blown away and lost the pearl
And the price she paid

Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

Isn't you, isn't me, search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach, somewhere in the vasoline

Two times and it has rendered me, punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone
Flies in the vasoline we are, sometimes it blows my mind
Keep gettin' stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me, search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach, somewhere in the vasoline

You'll see the look and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies and you will

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal

'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
"Think you're kinda neat"
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal

So do you laugh or does it cry?

Leavin' on a southern train, only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be, only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathin' is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied, goodbye

Where you goin' for tomorrow?
Where you goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel so much depends on the weather
So is it rainin' in your bedroom?
And I see that these are the eyes of disarray
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it
