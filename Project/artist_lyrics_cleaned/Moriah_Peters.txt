Caught a glimpse of Your grace
And I'm sure I heard You say
Pack your bags
Take your cross
Count everything as loss
I can feel my heart beat for the first time
And I stand alone for the last time
Now I know love costs my whole life
But my heart's all in and it's all right

To leave it all behind
I'm not afraid
I'm unashamed
I won't wait
To leave it all behind
To leave it all
Take a leap
And all of me
I believe
Is worth the sacrifice
To leave it all behind

In the joy in the hurt
For better or for worse
I'm not scared anymore
It feels like I've been reborn
So with open hands I confess
That You have this day and all the rest
I'm bought by blood You paid my price
My heart's all in and it's all right

To leave it all behind
I'm not afraid
I'm unashamed
I won't wait
To leave it all behind
To leave it all
Take a leap
And all of me
I believe
Is worth the sacrifice
To leave it all behind

I'll lose it all
To gain it all
No turning back
No turning
I'll lose it all
To gain it all
No turning back
I'm ready
To leave it all behind
I'm not afraid
I'm unashamed
I won't wait
To leave it all behind
To leave it all
Take a leap
And all of me
I believe
Is worth the sacrifice
To leave it all behind
To leave it all behind
To leave it all
Take a leap
And all of me
I believe
Is worth the sacrifice
To leave it all behind

And if I should fall You'll catch me
And if I should fall You'll catch me
And if I should fall You'll catch me
And if I should fall You'll catch
