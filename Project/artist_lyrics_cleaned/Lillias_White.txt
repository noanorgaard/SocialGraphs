Trainers hating on me, I don't get it why you mad bruh
Probably 'cuz I don't need a TM to get Swagger
Or 'cuz I can make your girl teleport like Abra
And if she wanna spoon trade that bitch a Kadabra
I just hit it, I'm not trying to chill and cuddle
Innards Out, no move, baby that's the Struggle
No teddy, Bewear, when I dig up in your Stufful
Brick Break in your walls turn your Graveler to rubble
Full Metal Body when I'm grasping the pen
Poke Bank couldn't hold the checks that I'm cashing in
Ability is Stamina no lasting with him
There'll never be a race that you're passing me in
I can go Berserk, I'm a Dragon, who's Drampa?
Professing on the mic, Gen 1, Blue's Grampa
Better man up, bars strong as Mudbray
I think you need to heal... go catch a Comfey
You might also like
The Cypher over of course you niggas ain't had enough
I'm honing edges I never miss my claws are tough
I splatter Rattata, you rats are gettin' fatter
A nigga got the juice never see me, Marshadow
I pop up real quick I'm like a Spectral Thief
Switchin' like Nintendo, you shocked, it's easy
I'm a vet, something like the goat
Can't hear competition I'm Choppin' all the Throats
Niggas wanna be relevant, ghost like Trevenant
Root of the problem, see through transparent
Don't speak you're a geek, just follow you're a sheep
Zubat's can't see, you suck no fleas
I'm in love with the cocoa
Niggas tappin' out in Round 2 like Johto
But I'm still up in it
I get my money rapid clear the haters I'ma spin it

B-E-A-T-D-O-dub-N 'GITTEM
OK Shofu Tha Beatdown
Tell yo' girl she ain't ready for the Meatdown
She got a Scary Face so you know my speed down
Still had a quickie so I shot my Bullet Seed out
We run this shit. We don't pretend to
Known to carry long arms, Mienfoo
Shofu brothers together, me and Fu
Infiltrated the song, let me in foo'
Don't get it twisted outside of this I'm a thug
Always got ice on my neck, Avalugg
Ice Punch 'til you freeze make your heart stop
Get the whip, ride on you niggas like I'm part rock
She Giga Drain these nuts and won't Spit Up
Every time I hashtag #GetInThemGuts
I burned up and kept the heat cuz I'm so hype
Then I burned up Rae Sremmurd got no type
Back at it again like Smeargle with the pen
When I'm Skethcin' you Trace, it I'm penning a win
Inkays you ain't catch it yo' rhymes are just hollow
Remixing these squids cuz you Mars are so mallow
Been a threat with the Mean Look
Trainers askin' me what I mean, look
These rappers stay shook when I'm Quaking the Earth
You ain't big you just Fluffy, this Klutz gon' get merked
I'm in tune with the bad guys
Soundproof in the booth, Bastiodon wise
Stay dressed to the nines, call the fit Blastoise fresh
Been buggin' on the Cypher, we the First to Impress
Give this track to a Rotom, it'll turn his ass to a toaster
Got the crowd jumpin' high bass kickin' like Pheramosa
Lookin' for a Trick, we'll treat ya before we ghost ya
Knock Off that Sleep Talking time's tickin' it's over

Don't blink.  You're in the midst of a Legend
The Rising Sunder straight out of Gen 7
Call these nobodies Nebby, how I'm baggin' 'em up
My heat flows make 'em sweaty like a magma slug
Can't see me like you're Slapped with Mud
Ice 'trios like I-Crash a Dug, Avalugg
You already a carcass for the Mandibuzz
I am the Sandslash Fissure to your Magneton
This what happens when the Totem calls
Get your Rotoms on cuz we the new Photo Spot
Roggenroll-up out of Johto looking Ho-oh hot
Squad of sharp lookin' mo-fos like Kommo-o claws
We on that Champion of the World shit, Wolfe, Glick
Volt Switchin' into a Room Tricked
You guessed wrong
And now your moves are truly useless, clueless
Take your fat L and know now that's how we do this
Got a Cryogonal on my chain
Diamonds stay icy but I'm spittin' flame
Pull up on Gogoat but y'all ain't the same
HM03 y'all just riding my wave
Came in with Shofu so know I'm not playing
Fuck is you sayin', stay out my lane
Catch you, release you, then I save the game
Ain't gotta say it, they all know the name
Gone for a minute but a nigga never lost hype
Went Ghost nigga try to hit me need to Foresight
Pussy right beside me, Giovanni I'm the boss type
Everything they hit me with is feeling like a False Swipe
I'm just getting better while you dying, call it Leech Life
Not a Double Battle but I'm still up in the Spotlight
A-Team nigga I'm a scholar try to sound bite
Young Fly nigga give a fuck about a Ground-type

Man this shit's too Eevee (x2)
And I keep my niggas with me like a Z-Move
Oh you got that Light Screen up?
Well it's all bullshit that I see through
Slaking, Slowking, nigga Nidoking
Man these niggas don't move 'til a King move
And you might not like me but you know who I am
Because my name ring bells like Chingling do
You thought I was gonna stay with that flow forever
Used to be a daredevil, now they say I know Endeavor
Cold hearted but I know I can do it in a colder weather
And I'm spitting fire I call it Scald cuz they go together
Putting all my Energy in all of these Punches, nigga I Focus better
Shocking niggas I stay in my Magnezone forever
Pidgeot fly, I'm taking it back to older feathers
Back on my bullshit for the niggas that don't remember

ShueTube and I'm at it again
About to Counter all the doubters, Hitmonchan with the pen
I'm back for Revenge, this track's for the Rattata who said
"He only raps about weed man, he's average at best"
Keep talking smack get Marowak'd in the head, you won't Retaliate
You'll probably just throw a Stomping Tantrum instead
Softer than Flaafy's mane, you're Cottonee attacking my cred
My Swagger attracted your girl and brought her back to my bed
She said she hasn't been fed, so I made sure that she was Klang'in on
She took a Tauros Ride, gave her that Filet Mignon
Doggy style she takes it raw, Naughty but her Nature's Calm
She told me my Steelix is her weakness like a Glaceon
She likes 'em crazy long, she don't like that baby dong
PP like a Chingling, you just made her Yawn
She keeps tryna breed me like an Eevee, see me fleeing if I make a mom
Later on, make her raise the spawn like a Kangaskhan

Hola, it's ya boy Jok3r and I'm in Alola
Got the chronic from Koga
Then hit up Gardenia to come through and roll up
On that Poke organic
Gettin' stoned like Roxanne is
Bitch I'm rock rough, I got a Keen Eye
And I'ma hit you with Toucannons
They must've thought I retired or quit
Been a while since spittin' this fire, burn tires on Firestone shit
Pop a flare on these hoes on my Fire Stone shit
Nauseous, on that Venomoth Toxic
PokeCash in my pocket
I got Beast Balls, I make three calls
And had three different squads of Team Rocket
Pull up on you, stop it

I guess my verse is next; like Toxapex, I'm Merciless
You're 10%, I'm perfected
Ego got my head bigger than a Persian is
So bear with me as I go hard, Ursuring
You soft like Stufful, don't got muscle
You always call for help like a Totem does, yo
Only tough when you're with your posse like a Wishiwashi
Otherwise you're a wimp you got me?
I don't know what kind of work you think you're putting
When your verses have no lines like Citra footage
I Blaze the track 'til it's melting slow
I sin, I roar, I'm fire, I got the belt for show
I run circles 'round you trainers like Festival Plaza
This Legend's coming after beasts guess I'm Necrozma
The monster's all black just like me
These ideas bouncing around in my head
Will leave 'em with a Shattered Psyche

Haven't dropped improbable bombs since 2013
Plotting nonsensical concepts I'm always Quirky
You're just another obstacle cop, you're probably thirsty
I'm an unstoppable God, rocking the first seed
This is my Tourney, you cannot verse me
Hot like Malasadas and I'm also Hala burly
You're trash like Burmy, you are not worthy
Think that you can hurt me but it turns out that I'm Sturdy
I'm the Wrath to all these Poliwags
I'm like Kakashi when I cop your moves with Copy Cat
You cannot stop me when my Toxic makes you lollygag
You're gonna want a Rocky Helmet when I drop these raps
I'll leave you hollering in pain, we're talking Wally bad
Why don't you head back down to Hau'oli where mommy's at
I will not sleep 'til I deafeat you, Insomniac
I'm taking Nebby out, get into the body bag!

I'm about to take the top spot, wait hold up
Underground rapper, Donphan how I roll up
You're 95% of Chansey, you ain't got no luck
Or Silvally that never evolved, you ain't gettin' no love
Sure enough, the flames I'm spittin' 'bout to make a nigga burn up
Brain dead flow, vegetable, Turnip
Mention me, you tryna get me riled and worked up
I'm snatchin' souls like Spiritombs and bodies never turn up
I said my name before so they hated me
Keen Eye, the dirt they throwing at me ain't phasing me
Comatose Komalas sleeping on me, that's insane to me
I'm always in the green stackin' 100's like a Celebi
You feelin' me? Haters air balloons, yeah they gettin' popped
Keep up with the chatter and I'm down your block, parting shot
Your girl like my style, she said that I'm spittin' hot
But if I go hard best believe she gon' be Lycanroc

Tanook's sorta like Giovanni: a boss, see
I'm doing it Fortrees so my Mossdeep
Y'all sleep on him but the kid be working all week
Kicking it like Brawly and his 'monlee
Low Kicks, high key
No Klef, man why he so fresh
Clothes from Malie City, PokeDollars on a rolex
Traveled to Alola, clear the dome, take a dope jet
Send her Floettes, now she hittin' me for phone sex
Iverson 76 Fly
Oh you, '02? You a little behind
Dude the kid'll beat minds but why am I never stressed, b?
Yo' girl in my DM's and she say that she wanna text me
Vibe's Soothe Bell, all these ladies acting friendly
Send me X's and O's like we making blocks in Gen 3
Amnesia, did you lose your memory?
Catch a Naughty man, drop a Body Slam
On a couple dead beats

I turn into an Ultra Beast once the beat's Thrashing
U-Turn into a Leavanny whenever the Heat's Crashing
Tell me, what's some weak scratches to some deep slashes
Headbanging to these bars 'til you leave your Skull Bashed in
Monstrous Megas with Metal that makes the Grossest Meta
The Heat Wave is here, I'm an alternative sweater
I leave 'em sweating cuz they Sea a King
Bars are what I tend to Fling
Not off the top I'll leave your top off like a Guillotine
Put a bit of Embers, now my bar's lit
Selling Stardust in the market
Girls are like Berries, I eat 'em and Harvest
Don't need a Lock-On to scope out my targets
Threw these birds miles away now they looking pretty Farfetch'd
To get on my level you'll have to Levitate
It's useless to Celebrate, try to run, Pursuit, it's too late
Wisped a Will-o on a widow proceeded to lit
And left that cat in a burning state

It's ya boy, the Alolan Gary Oak
White beetles on me bitch, you know I do the Phero-most
I'm out here sweeping trainers man, I'm nasty with the Poke's
And ya boy is Hard Body like I got that Metal Coat
Nigga I'm nice with it
Homie you better get your skills lined
Skarmory, this ammo hit you heavy but I'm Steel Fly
You ain't worthy, even with Sturdy you still die
I ain't missing nothing, especially with a Keen Eye
Niggas bugging think they fucking with us
Bitch I'm eating and y'all boys ain't Grubbin with us
Ladies love the way I flex, man they loving the Buzz
You grounded while I'm in the air, this that flow you can't touch
I'll battle anyone and I don't even play competitive
Y'all got Choice Band bars, boy that shit's repetitive
I never gave a fuck and these other trainers suck
Cuz they team is dysfunctional just like Lillie's relatives

From Mt. Coronet, download it and- wait...
The tape dropped now I'm back like Colress
Gun game Vulpix, first gen my heat so Moltres
But now I Let It Go like Frozen
Cuz we Disney here, pullin' fire out my ass like a Simisear
Yeah I ain't even really tryin' like Experience Share
It's too easy, G.Yee's a different tier
I'm at the top, you at the bottom rockin' with a Golem
Roster been a problem, fresh cuts like my barber been Kartana
Hotter than a Groudon, drown 'em in the lava
Spoutin' out the Mountain, shine and you don't like the body on Komala
Y'all suck
All these dudes are gettin' slapped
Colder than a Cubchoo chewing on the track, so chill
Someone tell this Lusamine relax
I go Lillie on the beat when I put it in a bag

Wearin' all black, Marshadow and I'm holding that
Thing I'll let fire in your bones like Alola 'wak
I Block the Mack quick so I suggest you chill ocky
I'm the gawd, you ain't shit but a carbon copy, Silvally
Pop up outta nowhere, feelin' Ultra Beast, whaddup tho
Fuck the gym up, my mind state is Buzzwole
Battle me? Boy you'll get a burn to the 3rd degree
Hookin' you to wires 'til you lookin' like a Xurkitree
Catch more shells than an army of Carracosta
Got a bad model bitch and she stand like Pheromosa
Pockets fat as Guzzlord, sharp as Kartana
Separate the arms of anyone that wants drama
That's Celesteela, they gon' feel the blast in Lilycove
When I Rock and Poison the game like Nihilego
I'm a whole different nigga, don't like it, I'll off ya
All you'll see is beams like you beefin' with Necrozma

Raindrop, drop top
Run up on Red, he like "dot dot"
'Zard put that heater in his mouth no hotpot
Blastoise open up his chest like a cough drop
Venusaur stomp his ass out, that's hop scotch
Hold up, never try to spy the man, you ain't Doc Oc
Buzzwole, I got them hands, bitch I'm Doc Oc
Hit you with Octillary, just like Doc Oc
Do you like Hillary, you gettin' Knocked Off
Bitch I'm runnin' shit like Trump do
Bet a bitch I'm runnin' in this bitch, I got Gumshoos
Purple in my hand, open up pineal gland like Oranguru
Readin' all my enemies' moves, bitch I'm Sun Tzu
I come through. Passimi-anything, I never fumble
Anything can happen, finger waggin' like Mutombo
Underneath the moonlight, hit the moonwalk
When the mood right, I might drop something you can bump to, hol' up

Yuh, that way, turn yo' Gym into an ashtray
Yuh, that way, volcanic flow on me now that's Blaine
Yuh, that way, niggas nosier than Probopass face
Yuh, that way, chain frozen, Alolan Sandslash way
Got some big dreams, bitches better wish me well
They give me mouth on sight, James' Victreebel
Do it out of Spite, your feelings get crit to hell
To spittin' Strength, I'm a slave that's Bibarel
Kill all these haters, do damage
Clippin' yo' wings with Toucannon, leave you lookin' Slowbro
Shock the world, that's Tapu Koko
We're on different scales, you should know you ain't shit to Kommo'o

We throw the fighting words around like a Judo Chop
A name's something that you don't got
Someone tell 'em Shofu don't stop
Keep it six-hunned, Pseudo slot
Yo' girl stay up on my head like Cubone's mom
Bitch if you don't Taunt, my bars burn you like a Will-o-Wisp
Just got my starter but I think it's time I finish this
Running through Vermillion, leave you blue like Cerulean
Check the furry channel to see how Toxic shit can really get
The flow is too cold, I got Frost Breath
Switch it up like Pokemon Trainer when he's exhausted
Lock him On then I off him, extra item, I toss em
My money too deep, I got Relicanth in my pockets
I'm ballin', yeah I make it rain like a Pelican
Shining like a lighthouse, I'ma need some medicine
Kartana ass niggas kinda delicate
Making pussy niggas call for help, I get going off my
