Now I know that hello is a show for a sweet goodbye
No tears to cry

Which one of us set on fire?
Cause we both went up in smoke
Which one of us cut the wire?
Ain’t no bottom to this hole

Coward burning the page
Rose from the flames
Flowers tossed to the wind
End to begin again

Now I know that hello is a show for a sweet goodbye
No tears to cry

Which one of us set on fire?
Cause we both went up in smoke
Which one of us cut the wire?
Ain’t no bottom to this hole

Would you save me?
And I’ll save you
We can save ourselves
Would you save me?
And I’ll save you
We can save ourselves

Which one of us set on fire?
Cause we both went up in smoke
Which one of us cut the wire?
Ain’t no bottom to this hole
Which one of us set on fire?
Cause we both went up in smoke
Which one of us cut the wire?
Ain’t no bottom to this
