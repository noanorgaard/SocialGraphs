Blackout, blackout!

Vino el apagón, ¡ay dios! (Oh, no!)

¿Oye, qué pasó? (Blackout, blackout!) (Oh, no!)

Vino el apagón, ¡ay dios! (Hold up, wait, hold up, wait!) (Oh, no!)

Yo! I! Can’t see! (Nina, where'd you go?) (Oh, no!)
Quit shovin’ you son of a— (I can't find you) (Oh, no!)
It’s an oven and we gotta back out (Nina, take it slow, I'm behind you) (Oh, no!)
This is a blackout! (Oh, no)
Chill, for real or we’re gonna get killed!

Calling all ​taxis! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)

Everyone ​relax ​please (Suddenly I find the electricity is gone) (Oh, no!)

Calling all ​taxis! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)

Everyone ​relax ​please (I gotta guard the store, make sure that nothing's going wrong) (Oh, no!)

Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)

Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Gotta find Usnavi, tell him what is going on) (Oh, no!)

Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Nothing is on, nothing is on) (Oh, no!)

And I can’t find Usnavi (No! No! No!)
Nina where’d you go? (Vanessa) (Has anyone seen Benny?)

Please find Nina!
Find Camila! (Find my way home)
If you see my family
Bring them home! (Usnavi, help me!)

We are powerless
We are powerless (You left me alone!)

We are powerless, we are powerless

Yo! Yo! They throwin’ bottles in the street
People lootin’ and shootin’
Sonny, they wanna see a robbery
We gotta keep movin’
Naw, man, I can’t leave, we gotta guard the store!

They gonna bombard the store
Until you ain’t got a store no more!

I got a baseball bat on a rack in the back

I got a couple Roman candles
We can distract the vandals

Hey, yo, I see some thugs comin’
Man, we gonna get jacked up

Gimme a light, I’ll be right back. Back up—

Back up! Back up!


Look at the fireworks, look at the fireworks fly
Light up the night sky, light up the night sky
Look at the fireworks, look at the fireworks fly
Light up the night sky, light up the night sky

It’s late and this grate won’t come down, come down!

It’s late and this grate (Oh God, so much panic!)
Won’t come down! (The crowd was manic)

We are ​powerless (With everybody screaming and shoving and shouting and slapping) (Mira, mi amor, házme un favor)
We are ​powerless (And everyone's franctic! What's happening with you?) (Despiértale abuela y a lo mejor ella tiene una vela)

We are powerless (Estuve bailando cuando vino el apagón)

We are powerless (Aquí hay gente)

Powerless! (Pero no sé quienes son)

Look at the fireworks

Abuela, are you alright?

Light up the night sky

The stars are out tonight!

Look at the fireworks

You’re not alone tonight

Light up the night sky

You’re not alone tonight (I'm not alone tonight)

Usnavi, please promise me
You’ll guard this with your life

Abuela, I’ve never seen—

This much money in my life!

Nina, there you are!

I’ve gotta go!

I’ll get you out of here tonight

I don’t need anything!
Tonight, I can find my way home—

Then find your way home!

Without you

Without you!


Look at the fireworks

Look at the fireworks

Look at the fireworks

Look at the fireworks

Light up the night sky

Light up the night sky

En Washington—
Look at the fireworks
Look at the fireworks

Light up the night sky

Light up the night sky

En Washington 

Damn, this is nice
I really like what they’ve done with the lights
So, the hot club in Washington Heights
You might be right, this music’s tight
Yo, did I mention that you look great tonight?
Because you do, you really—

Usnavi, relax

Relax, qué relaxed? I’m relaxed

¡Wepa, Vanessa!

So you’ve been here before
I don’t go out, I get so busy with the store
Y cada día it’s a brand new chore
My arms are sore, no time for the dance floor
But maybe you and me should hang out some more
I’m such a dork, but I—
You might also like
Let’s go get a drink

Something sweet

You know me, a little bit of cinnamon

¡Wepa, Vanessa!


Here’s to getting fired

To killing the mood

¡Salud!

Without so much as a “thank you"
After five long years

Cheers!

To finally getting Vanessa
Man, fix your collar

Holler!

To doing shots on a weekend

As long as you buy ‘em, l’chaim!
Hey, you!

Who?

You!
Who, me?

You wanna dance?

Naw, man

Okay, I took my chance

It’s cool, it’s cool, hey, if you want to

You don’t mind?

I’m fine, I’m fine

Yo

Yo

Who’s Vanessa talkin’ to?

Some dude

Some dude?
That’s messed up, she’s tryin’ to make you jealous

Jealous, I ain’t jealous, I can take all these fellas, whatever!


Benny, can we take a walk outside?

And there she is

I’m so sorry, I didn’t know

Who let you in?
Yo, this is the girl who cost us our jobs today!

I’m gonna make it right

A toast to the end of all I know

You’ve had enough

Says the girl who has it all

That’s not fair

Well why don’t you run home to Daddy?
He loves to remind me
That I’ll never be good enough for your family
For you

You don’t know me

Poor you

I thought you were different

Vanessa, let me get the next one
Vanessa, let me interject some
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more
Vanessa, let me get the next one
Vanessa, let me interject some
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more
Vanessa, let me get the next one
Vanessa, let me interject some
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more


Bartender!
Let me get an amaretto sour for this ghetto flower
How are you so pretty?
You complete me
You had me at hello, you know you need me
Truly, madly, deeply, let’s get freaky
Oh, I get it, you’re the strong and silent type
Well, I’m the Caribbean island type
And I can drive you wild all night!
But I digress, say something so I don’t stress

No hablo inglés

Yes!
