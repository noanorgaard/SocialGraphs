Heavy
It's a heavy weight
Put it all on me
Is that all I meant to you?
Call me
Could you call my name?
Will it sound the same?
Is that all I meant to you?

The mess of this is shattering
In pieces of such ugly things
For you to hide all you feel in your life
You went away, nowhere close to my side
And did you breathe in the mountain air?
Look twice so your love could seek air
You might also like
Heavy
It's a heavy weight
Put it all on me
Is that all I meant to you?
Call me
Could you call my name?
Will it sound the same?
Is that all I meant to you?

I don't want to leave your heart to know
You've got to leave room for us to grow
A positive sign, an even flow
Catch a space in time for letting go
And did you breathe in the mountain air?
A fallow state for your lungs to seek air

Heavy
It's a heavy weight
Put it all on me
Is that all I meant to you?
Call me
Could you call my name?
Will it sound the same?
Is that all I meant to you?
Smoke rings in a fallow state
It all feels the same
'Cause thats all I meant to
