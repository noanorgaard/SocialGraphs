You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole)
I want to be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woollen jumper
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Be your Minpin
And Borrower of handsome trivia (Hey!)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

All hand claps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios (Ooh)
I'm gonna kiss you
Like the sun browns you (Hey!)

Go alone, my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones, alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning
They'll nosh you up, yes, they'll nosh the love away
But it's fair to say, you will still haunt me

My right hand's gripped on his Colt
Single-action army

From you, Taro
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Do not spray into eyes

3:10 pm: Capa pends death
Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Le photographe est mort
3.1415, alive, no longer my amour
Fated for home, May of '54
Doors open like arms, my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
Reunited with his leg

Hey, 

Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me, plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night, your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine

Hair the way the sun really wants it to be
Whiskey soda please, your G&T is empty
Jeff's inflatables have sunk to the bottom
Pool, summer, summer, pool, pool summer
Kiss me
Cali let's dive, dive down
To the pool's bottom where we belong
Cali you're sinking like a bleeding stone
All above crowd around, so fucking loud

Heard it down on the radio (La-la la-la la-la la)

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And I, ah-ah-ah-ah

Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now sleep, build up breakfast
Now let's eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love (La la la la)

Ooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The nights of all my youth pressed into one glass of water

Scattered truths, bewildered beast boohoos

All the vowels vow to guard your name
Keep your estate clean, happy
Some things lie too deep for tears to well
Close eyes open, close again, feel as my body spells

In your snatch fits pleasure, broom-shaped pleasure
Deep greedy and googling every corner
La, Trala–, Tra-a-la, –la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Dead in the middle
Of the C-O-double-M O-N
Little did I know then
That the Mandela Boys soon become Mandela Men
Tall woman
Pull the pylons down
And wrap them around the necks
Of all the feckless men that queue to be the next

Steepled fingers
Ring la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-leaders
Queue-queue jumpers
Rock, fist, paper, scissors, la-la-la-la-la-la-lingered fluffers
They choir:
In your hoof lies the heartland
Where we tent for our treasure, pleasure, leisure
