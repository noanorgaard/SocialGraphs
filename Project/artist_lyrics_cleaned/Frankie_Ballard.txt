There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

I didn't have much money, but I covered them rounds
Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren’t shooting on whiskey, just shooting the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer

Here’s to you baby
So tonight lets raise ‘em up to where we ended up

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now, I might have to kiss no telling how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches
Don't learn nothing 'til you make a lot of mistakes
How will I know where to draw the line
If I don't cross it a few hundred times?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah, I'm gonna stay out all night
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right
I've gotta live a lot of life if I'm gonna give good advice
When I'm talking to my grand-babies
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah, I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Young and crazy
Young, young and crazy
Young and 

Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees"

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this"
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away
