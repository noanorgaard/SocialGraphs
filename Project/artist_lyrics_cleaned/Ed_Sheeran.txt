Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down

Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek 'cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hopin' for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then, you'd laugh at me and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then, you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now

I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa

We're not watching Formula 1

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo)

I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand-new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand-new day

We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

I met you when I was a teen, but then, you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And "Re: Stacks" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say, "You are beautiful without your makeup
And you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight
'cause we can all be loved the way that God made us"
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina

And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own

Watchin' Blue Planet, creatin' new habits
Actin' as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish
I understand, but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever, so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break

(But you can't mend your broken heart)
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
'Cause I ain't never comin' home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina (I've been livin' on the road)

But then again, you should know, Nina (But then again, you should know)

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect 

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

In Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was workin' on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearin' borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growin' old
Five sons and three daughters

From her snow-white streak in her jet-black hair
Over sixty years I've been lovin' her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know, Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)

Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like
