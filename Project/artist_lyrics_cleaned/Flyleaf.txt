I'm so sick, infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick, I'm so sick

If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll shut up (Shut up, shut up)
And stay sleeping
With my screaming in your itching ears

I'm so sick, infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so sick, I'm so sick

Hear it, I'm screaming it
You're heeding to it now
Hear it, I'm screaming it
You tremble at this sound

You sink into my clothes
This invasion makes me feel
Worthless, hopeless, sick

I'm so sick, infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness
I'm so, I'm so sick

Let me live without this
Empty bliss, selfishness

I'm so (I'm so)
I'm so sick (I'm so sick)

Her last words still hanging in the air
In the air

Sorrow lasts through this night
I'll take this piece of You
And hope for all eternity
For just one second I felt whole
As You flew right through me

Left alone with only reflections of the memory
To face the ugly girl that's smothering me
Sitting closer than my pain
He knew each tear before it came
Soon He will perforate the fabric of the peaceful by and by

Sorrow last through this night
I'll take this piece of You

And we kiss each other one more time
And sing this lie that's halfway mine
The sword is slicing through the question
So I won't be fooled by his angel light

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing say, "We are alone with you"
I am alone and they are too with you

I wanna be there for you

You can breathe today

So many lies swirling
All around you
You're suffocating
The empty shape in you
Steals your breath

Logic forces me to believe in this
And I have learned to see
And I can only say what I've seen and heard
And only you can choose
And every choice you make will affect you
Suit your own self
