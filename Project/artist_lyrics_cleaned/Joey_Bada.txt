I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

Now everybody got problems, yeah
But wouldn't know what way to solve ’em
I really came up from the bottom
Strugglin’, my momma on her last dollar
Hustlin' and I’ve been puttin' in these hours
The government been tryna take away what's ours
It's really all about the money and the power
I just wanna see my people empowered
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon’ shape this vision
Complainin' all day, but in the same condition
If you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment

Can't emancipate them from the mental prisons

Before the money there was love
But before the money it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo

Sittin' back plottin', jottin' information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still plantin' plantations, we keep buyin' in
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and
Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua

The flow like plenty lava, with just a penny I could
Multiply my worth and make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christenin'
Watch what you dishin' and please play it safe
'Cause your position on the top is switchin' right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep duckin' down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them, the Pros been on a mission, listen
Enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' MACs, I raise stakes to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS, "Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis, I got"
Dreams sellin' arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm crackin' a Serena

Overdose on high fructose, royal toast till I’m overthrown
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetera, whatever
Why do they sweat us?
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us
They don't know better than the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause they worship our position
But I too had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter

Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming "Land, ho!" 'Bout to hit for sure (Sure)
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure, like nice beaches
That even at my weakest, I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches? Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts, like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for acting a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for making a move
We get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"

'Cause every time I make a move, they be sweating me
They want another Black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me (Next to me)

It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't letting me

You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG (Respect, respect, respect)

Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me (Testing me)
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me (Less of me)
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me (Blessing me)
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace (Rest in peace)
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me (Hope for a nigga like me)

One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damn it

By the lyric-ill New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo, some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it (Yo), let me take a seat
This where Rosa park her bum, now make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message at the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak (I don't wanna speak)
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak (I don't wanna speak)
I just wanna be, girl, I just wanna be

You rap niggas ain't safe yet, hah
I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate, you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon' spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been trying to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs

But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey, Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey, Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?

Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up, he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splitting and soul uplifting
But still feel so trapped in the solar system

And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey, Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey, Jesus
Will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
If I see you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus view
See you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view
And I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

I could never forget them gloomy days
Although I regret where my time was placed
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp
Surrounded us all like bonfire
When I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh

Sometimes I really need to fly away

Went outside this morning, morning, uh
Seen the sky was falling, falling, yeah
Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh
What's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight
Outside my comfort zone tonight
My brain's blown out my dome tonight
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight
Don't you trying looking for light
Cause I'm bout to take that flight

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away
Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the water and pocket a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guava
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I grow smarter
The flow's water, like Osama
Oughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change
Move into the woods so I'll never ever change
Lose a couple friends but I'll never ever change
I probably miss some money but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood why the stars went insane
Ummmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one

Fuck outta here
Beast coast, nigga
Pro Era in your area

This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

Dmm—dmm, dmm, dmm, dm-dmm, dmm
Niggas know—niggas, niggas, niggas know
