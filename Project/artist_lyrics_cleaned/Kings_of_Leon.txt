Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, come home before the rooster crows

I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's going to tickle
You're going to giggle
It's going to tickle
Tickle for free

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I

All the black inside me is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started, it's bound to be a sight to see

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holdin' on

Rolling Stone has it on a list of Top Vampire songs.
Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

The lamp
Flickers in the bedroom
She must feel as awkward
Whorehouse Arizona
Now go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk to
Shake hands

My face
Staring on the pavement
Tasted something awful
I hate when that happens
She waves
Thinkin that it's sexy
She must be plum crazy

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

I see your shadow knocking at my door

Waiting on the smoke to rise from behind your eyes
Take me away
Follow me into the wild
With a twisted smile
I can't escape
And now I got you by my side
All my life
Day after day
Turn to gray

I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

With a kiss as unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times

The exit sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place

It's in the water
It's where you came from

When the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story
Where you came from
The sons and daughters in all their glory
It's gonna shape 'em
And when they clash and come together
And start rising
Just drink the water where you came from
Where you came from

You're the rose that was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away
