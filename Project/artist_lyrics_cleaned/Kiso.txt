Fuck this
Fuck that
Fuck me
Fuck you
Fuck everyone here
And everybody else too
Fuck off
Fuck face
Fuck all night long
Fuck everything everywhere
And fuck this song

(Schäffer the Darklord goes)
Fuckity fuckity fucking mother fa duckity
It sucks how some fuckers make
Such a fuss when they fuck with me
And it sucks how this fucking word fuck
Seems to be stuck to me
Luckily the company
I keep doesn't care
Everywhere and anywhere
Everybody swears when their
Little middle fingers wiggle up in the air
Dare me not to use it dude
And I will lose a dare
Cause I struggle with it's usage
Every time that I write rhymes
Times I abuse it, but try as I might my
Little f-word is heard
It bites my ass
I fight it back
Alas it wins
And then it slips right in
And begins to blend in
Filling syllables in
And if it offends and
Or if in the end
I defend its intent
Then I'll get different friends
Come on

When a hot David Famous beat drops I'm on it
And when I'm in a house that house is haunted
And when I'm on the roof that roof is on fire
And every time I do tell the truth I sound like a liar
So fuck it
Fuck this song and fuck me
Let me hear you all say fuck S.T.D
(fuck S.T.D.)
Yes you understand
And in case I haven't mentioned it
Fuck you and your band
If you see Kay
Tell her I say hey
And then tell her she should stay the hell away today
And if kay takes offense to this then just say
I'm sorry Kay I guess that this just isn't your day
Any person heard cursin' so much it's absurd
It's worse than any jerk
Referrin' to himself in third person
Take it from Schäffer
Cause he's a nerd and he's certain
That dirty words are for the birds
This verse was terse then!

This word is most often a verb when it's mentioned
But it's a fucking awesome adverb in this sentence
Every then and now found as a put down, noun
Or even as an adjective as in "you fucking clown"
Wow this number's runnin' now and how
And it's somethin' about nothin'
'cept fuckin' and now
I see why this trap happens so often and time
And why half of all rappers half-assedly rhyme
And I find
That my cousins use cussin' as stuffin'
Fluffin' up some fucked up
Huffin' and puffin' about nothin'
Under unintelligible mumbling
And this bumbling fuckery gets
So redundant and insulting
Consumers are stupid, goofy, gullible vultures
With iPods and my god
Why does pop culture
Even get to have a status as a culture at all?
What passes for subversive has nerve but no balls
And you know what I find funny?
Monkeys
Know what's even funnier?
The phrase: fuckin' monkeys
Utter it with me fuckers!
Say it
Fuckin' monkeys!
It's fun huh?
You're a bunch of fuckin' monkeys
Fuckin' monkeys
Monkey fuck a bunch of mother fuckin' mothers
But some others monkeys fuck each other
Under one another
If you wanna fuck a monkey lover
Give us a kiss
Man i'm fucked if I want a radio edit of this
Come on

1 ContributorFake Lyrics
I love your fake hair, fake name, and that fake game/
Fake laugh, fake lips, fake person with the entire world to blame/
I am your fake man, and you are my fake wife/
With you I have a perfectly perfect, a wonderful fake life/
Words no longer have meaning, everything is just an illusion/
Every your hug, causes in me, just more confusion/
I don’t know what I wanna, but we could give it a try/
Please, fake loving me, and I will fake a lie/
The more time I spend with you, the more time I wanna spend with you/
No matter what I do, it’s always god damn it fucking about you/
That’s right, you and me, it would never work/
But it’s my fake happiness, so I confess you are my world/

Don’t make me wait, little baby girl/
Turn off the lights, let’s lose control/
We go on and on, with you I wanna more/
With this song I curse the night, I didn’t go inside/

Don’t don’t ever let me know don’t/
Ever let me know know/
That you’re gone/
2x

Quédate aquí, cerca de mi/
Que sin tu amor no puedo seguir/
Eres mi guía y quiero sentir/
Tu mano en mi cuerpo para ser feliz/
Quédate cerca, no te das cuenta?/
Apaga la luz y cierra la puerta/
Ya no preguntes, yo soy tu respuesta/

Getting lost in night clubs, sipping alcohol, being with whores/
I seem happy, but at 5AM I don’t wanna take it anymore/
Red eyes, heads exploding, for me it’s a normal condition/
Give me a reason and please try to put yourself in my position/
I try to avoid it, but you come and visit me all the time/
I smoke and drink to get rid of the last parts of my mind/
I didn’t kiss you when we were 16, neither will I if we turn 90/
Make me forget about you, you know I don’t wanna be without you/
There are no bodies who can replace what I felt when with you/
It isn’t love, but lately I catch myself thinking about you/
I hate the entire world, days pass me by, I can’t sleep/
At nights, I imagine your shadow next to me/
You said you don’t want me to disappear, and I said don’t worry/
This ain’t no rock music, but it’s our little story/
I dreamed about 2 girls, and now I am alone again/
I wanted to be a better man, but there is no one who understand/
Don’t make me wait, little baby girl/
Turn off the lights, let’s lose control/
We go on and on, with you I wanna more/
With this song I curse the night, I didn’t go inside/

Don’t don’t ever let me know don’t/
Ever let me know know/
That you’re gone/
2x

Oh my gosh, what am I doing here with you on my mind/
I mean I find myself thinking about you all the time/
It’s red lights, blue lights, we’ve seen them all/
I know I mentioned it a few times, but I miss you more/
This wasn’t supposed to be about you, but I am writing this down/
I swear on that bed I wanted to go all the way down/
We did a few things, but then I decided to stop/
Not because I don’t wanna, but because I knew you needed a hug/
I knew and you knew, it wasn’t quite what it looked like/
But I promise, I’ll make it up to you, you’re the one I like/
Everything happened fast, look I made an entire song/
I’m not happy, but for now it seems at least to be under control/
Call me and I’ll come, I’m under your spell/
Tell me, do we really wanna something, or is it just another game/
Lemme show you what it’s like, to fuck with someone right/
Please show me what it’s like to spend with you a night, tonight/
How do I see myself watch you love him/the same way you watched me give her something/Why do I appear shattered/Why am I broken/I've become numb to love/2017/It’s my perfect world/entertainment/fake, fake, fake me/fake, fake, fake
