I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving
Makes me laugh, makes me smile all the while
Whenever I'm with you, girl
While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw
Ohhh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh

I love music
Sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing

I'm so happy to be in complete harmony
I love you, girl
As I hold you so close in my arms
I'm so glad that you're mine, all mine
Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet, so sweet
So mellow, mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arms
Oooh, honey I love you, I love you, yeah
Music is the healing force of the world
It's understood by every man, woman, boy and girl
And that's why, that's why I say (That's why, that's why)

Mellow, mellow wine and song

Underneath the mistletoe, I saw a face all aglow
Last year, this time
Now I stand all alone and my house is not a home
Without that girl of mine, oh

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the one you love
And New Year's just ain't New Year's without the one you love

12 o'clock and all is well and I was doing oh so swell
Last year, this time
Going shopping for presents together and making vows to leave each other, never
It was a waste of time, oh

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the one you love (Oh, oh, oh)
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the one you love

Oh, oh
(Christmas just ain't Christmas without the one you love)
And New Year's is just another lonely night without the one you love, and oh no
(Christmas just ain't Christmas) No, no
(Without the one you love) I'm gonna be lonely
I'm gonna be lonely, ohYou might also
