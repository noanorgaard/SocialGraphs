Why are they refusing to listen? Why are these troops on a mission?
And why are they shooting these victims over their view of religion?
Yeah, why do we all search for love like we got Cupid's addiction?
Why with politicians, you can't tell the truth from the fiction?
Why do we pollute where we're living?
Why are these youth put at risk?
And why is this ruling dominion kept us consumed in this prison
Nah, nah, nah, I won't jump through the hoops of this system
Nothing stands between you and the pursuit of your vision
I grab a loop of this rhythm, it puts the juice in my pistons
So jump back, react, spit in the booth with precision
And when I'm cruising with Izm, yeah, I'm deucing the spliff
And it's a BnE show, bitch, getting loose was a given
I don't want them to look back when the future was written
And know we killed ourselves
With nuclear fission and stupid decisions
Shit, I'd rather an asteroid due for collision
Then know the planet got fucked by the human condition
Sing the tune with conviction

And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask 'em why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
Well, if you don't know, shit, I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

Yeah, I'm an old school poet
Yeah, yo, yo

Yo, I'm an old school poet, I cherish the ink
That cosmic cowboy that doesn't care what they think
Real magic isn't card tricks, big cribs and cars, bitch
It's making something out of nothing through this hardship
And even though that the Earth is weak
We still bomb each other and idol what the churches speak
It's like this land is either run by Labor or Liberal
But don't get it twisted, they're the same as the criminals
So open your eyes, simply notice the issue
That we stuck to our guns without promoting the pistol
And we orchestrated the sound that we all love
Split because of colour, but bound because of blood
So before we all blow and they sell the scene
Know that the only thing that's bulletproof's my self-esteem
See, this is way beyond cash and ego tripping
It's an epic electric Eso ecosystem, grow with me
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask 'em why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
Well, if you don't know, shit, I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
Pollution th-thr-threatens
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Kids trust no one 'cause fire burn dem
The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat
It's an inferno land, pollution th-thr-threatens
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Fuck your race riot, fuck all that shit
We are all here together in this country as fuckin' one
As one
It's all about peace, love and unity
Sing it, peace, love and unity
C'mon, peace, love and unity
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask 'em why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
Well, if you don't know, shit, I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

The seventh scripture...
Will be read by the inquisitor of all intelligence, Jonathan Coltrane
Rally forth, my people of love, rally forth
Since ancient times, Chinese, if you will, were samurais and Japanese people accumulating by the mountains would engage in warfare, a martial arts styles
It was passed on through generations through monks, druids, and many others. Just like the poets
That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, poetry has been in existence, since, if you will, the beginning of time. Even the dinosaurs used to move in a poem-like form
Even the ancestors, the sharks, used to "hooo" in a seal-like manner. My friends, poetry has been among us since the beginning of time
Amen to Coltrane, amen to Coltrane, amen to Coltrane
