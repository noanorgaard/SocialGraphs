What do you know?
I'm a fool for you
Tell me the same lie twice
I'll still believe it's true

I will wait for you
Until the summer comes
At the park in June after dark
Where the people go

Won't you dance around in my head?

There's an image of you behind my eyes that haunts me
It's vivid and it's bright and it swings with a weight that crushes
People used to look at you like you were fiction
I remember trying my best to read you too
You might also like
I don't know why
I think you'll come back
At least I hope you will
Oh, I think you will
Woah, said it's getting dark
I get drunk for the night
Until the day restarts

I will wait for you
Until the summer comes
At the park in June after dark
Where the people go
I will wait for you
Until the summer comes
At the park in June after dark
Where the people go

Won't you dance around in my head?
Dance around in my head
And I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for
