I’m, just looking, for something to do
I’m, just looking, for some where to poo
Where, can I, fufill my senses
I’m, not trying to be all pensive
Shut, my brain into a lock box
Then, go play some frick'n Roblox
Well, you see what I am saying
I, am trying to spend the day in
Don’t, give me anything complicated
Just, enough to make me satiated
Huh, a game that will have me paying
Huh, I’ll just have to go super saiyan
Yep, no way not a worry bout tomorrow
Just, the thought starts to make me wallow
Lie, on top, my sacred sleeping place
Wow, I love, wasting the day with haste

Holy cannoli I got a rollie on my wrist
Wallet below me swelling up like some cysts
Blind leading blind, you shot and you missed
I only shoot green, Draymond with the assist
Balling out, hit it three times like the pistons
I'm single, but not bitchless don't get it twisted
Point of view shifted
Blink once you might miss it
Bars got me constricted
Feeling contradicted
Yeah
Got a bad bitch who looks like a Barbie
This ain't no game, no bullshit Atari
Playing patty-cake with a girl in my 'rari
Get the fuck out my face, no need to say sorry
Steal his girl, family feud, call me Steve Harvey
Busted down, down to clown, call me Playboi Carti
The O should've signed me
This track deserves an Emmy
Instead I'm with Adam Sandler
And Steve fucking Buscemi
Love for racks, is giving me a hard on
Right pocket, berreta. left pocket, coupon
These bitches cheap, my money you can count on
Repping a tux, you're pulling up with a clip on
My eyes on my future, the past you can dwell on
Too pussy for this flow, you might need a bigger tampon
Hunting all y'all, going for everyone's head
Make y'all stop breathing, yeah whole lotta red
I'm your daddy, I'll send you to bed
Actin like my bro, when you really just fed
Racks like COVID, the way it just spreads
I am a noose, leaving you hanging by some threads
My time is over I'll leave it to my friends
I'll see you outside when this cypher ends

They say I'm low to the ground but I'm feeling like I 6 foot
Standing so tall cause they don't know my output
24/7, 365 a year
I'm making these beats to bless your fucking ears
Yeah I know these guys, they're my stupid ass friends
But I gotta stick with them till the bitter ends
Nah, I'm better then y'all bitches
Nah, I'm just better ya bitches
You barely see me going around the town
That's cause' I don't go outside you circus clown
Stay inside almost every single day
Not interacting cause I don't know what to say
Do I really need to do that at all
I just wanna slack maybe go to the mall
I don't know why you're always forcing me
To do something that I wouldn't do for free
Never tell me what you thinking bruh
I never even claimed to be a thug
But you think that the streets are what
Make tough motherfuckas tough, yeah
I feel like I don’t got enough
Drive at all, yeah, for this stuff
A bit or a bite of what
Reside in my mind for what
Taking my time in this bitch
Raking my mind for this shit
I’m thinking I’m praying that
Blessings come raining and
Drugs stay delaying and
We can come together
Two birds on the same fuckin’ feather
We’re tied in this shit forever
Know that I won’t settle
Bro fall low? I’d never
I’m stuck on the fucking crossroads
Some write but got no bars though
It wasn’t just luck on my side, ho
I know
Concealed fate
Some stay or go a day late
All these hoes just overstay
Their welcome, but bitch it’s not seldom
How come, many go, try to get their penny flows
On stage for the whole world bro
But get flamed on the tour though
I’m good, I’ll go
Malevolent never near my pedestal
Just know, I’ll flow
Til’ the end of time
