Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth
Below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
You might also like
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it, to see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth
Below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one 

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you

I remember dreaming
Wishing, hoping, praying for this day
Now we sit and watch them
The little ones I love
So excited by the wait

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you

And now the word is given
It's time to peek inside
It's time to let the toys out
So anxious for your look of joy
And delight
They've waited for
Just your surprise

I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moonsongs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through

I'll hear your song
If you want me to
I'll sing along
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved"
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
And what do you got!
When you feel the same?
