Ain't no pressure, I was built for this
How they say I'm gon' drown, better fix they lips
Used to never check for me now they pose for pics
Now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
Yup, work coming in Sunday to Sunday
Make your man turn into a fan with the tongue play
He gon' drown in it, go deep, I'm Beyonce
Any fantasy, just don't tell me that you love me...
'Cause you ain't built for that
Had a heart in my past but it fade to black
I ain't with the bullshit or the tit for tat
And my whole squad real, we don't mix and match (nah, fuck that)
I'm the bigger picture
Talkin' 'bout money might get it wit ya
Finesse what I want so i get it quicker
You can tell that I just rolled up

'Cause when I'm chillin' I be coming down
Told him roll me up a blunt, I need another round
And he hit me on my chirp, he want it by the pound
Niggas call me when they need it 'cause I be around
Alright
'Cause when I'm chillin' I be coming down
Told him roll me up a blunt, I need another round
And he hit me on my chirp, he want it by the pound
Niggas call me when they need it 'cause I be around
Alright

Finessing the plug, Finessing the plug, finessing the plug
Finessing the plug,
Lettin' a bitch nigga know I'm thinkin' 'bout getting a nut
Smokin' a dub, Hennessy all in my cup, never forgettin' the thugs
Hittin' the club, all of my bitches a 10, niggas be yellin' wassup
Never in love, these niggas know I'm a G, OW
When I'm chillin' I be coming down
Niggas blowin' up my phone, they wanna come around
All these bitches are my daughters like they need a mama
Don ain't filming if these actors wanna bring the drama, drama

'Cause when I'm chillin' I be coming down
Told him roll me up a blunt, I need another round
And he hit me on my chirp, he want it by the pound
Niggas call me when they need it 'cause I be around
Alright
'Cause when I'm chillin' I be coming down
Told him roll me up a blunt, I need another round
And he hit me on my chirp, he want it by the pound
Niggas call me when they need it 'cause I be around

I can make the work ring like a beepa
Wrist game Tina Turner
And I never let it sit on the burna
I could make the work stretch in the benzo
I could make the work stretch in the rental
If you want it you can get it by the bundle
Slingin' pounds from the trap to the condo
You know I keep it wrapped up
No fronto
You know I keep it wrapped up
No fronto
I might pull up in Hyundai
And I still get work on a Sunday
On a Sunday?
