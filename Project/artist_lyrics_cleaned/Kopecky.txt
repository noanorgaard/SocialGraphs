Everyday it's closer
Don't take it back, no, no, sir
I'll play my favorite part for you
I'm in a strange position
Come on and join where I am at
I'll keep the door wide open for you

How did I find myself here with you?
Granted you play your cards right, baby I swear I won't fight
I like this game we're playing, do you?
