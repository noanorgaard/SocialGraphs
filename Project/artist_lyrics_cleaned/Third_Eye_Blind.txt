The angry boy a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight, you're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well, everyone I know has got a reason
To say, "Put the past away"

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand

Well, he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left you, you've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today, you could put the past away

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

I would understand, I would understand
I would understand

I would understand
I would understand

Can you put the past away?
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she livin', she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me, ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was takin' sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smilin' in the pictures you would take
Doin' crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there to
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want somethin' else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else
I'm not listenin' when you say
Goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feelin', an earthy feelin'
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you, I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm strugglin' to survive
Those days you were wearin' that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still, it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright
And I want somethin' else
To get me through this life, baby
I want somethin' else
Not listenin' when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
