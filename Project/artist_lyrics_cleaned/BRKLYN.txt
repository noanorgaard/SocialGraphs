And if I ask time to stand still
Could I come a little closer?
And if I asked you to love me
What if I asked you to love me?

Could I steal your heart?
Could I steal your heart?
And if I asked you to love me
What if you wanted to love me?
Let me steal your

Let me steal your heart

Open up your heart a little more
Just a little more, oh woah
Leaving all your fears behind the door
You might also like
And if I ask time to stand still
Could I come a little closer?
And if I asked you to love me
What if I asked you to love me?

Could I steal your heart?
Could I steal your heart?
And if I asked you to love me
What if you wanted to love me?
Let me steal your


And if I asked you to love me
What if you wanted to love me?
Let me steal your
