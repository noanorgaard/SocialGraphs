I was born to tell you, "I love you"
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take
When you are sitting next to me
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy?
What's your, what's your

I was born to tell you, "I love you"
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath

Don't make me change my mind

Is there anybody out there?
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone?
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home?

Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried?
I'm looking for an answer

You can live and die
Without the chance to find out what you're worth
You can live and die
And never find the one that you deserve
You can walk alone
And live inside the shadows in your heart
You can say goodbye
Only to find you've been alone right from the start
So what am I fighting for? Tell me
