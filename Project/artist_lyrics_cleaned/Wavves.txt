I don't understand at all
Me, my mom and dad just paused
Then laughed it off
In the house where I grew up
Santa burned the trash but now
Bears a song again

Every little thing is my fault
Every little thing is my fault
Everything is my fault
Everything is my fault
Everything is my fault
Everything is my fault

In the evening
Less than even
But I’m coming
Uhh, they’re the same, too
Like I’m doing this for nothing

One is nine, nine is two
Holy God and holy truth
Nine is God, nine to come
Nine to breathe inside your lungs
One is nine, nine is two
Holy God and holy youth
Nine is God, nine to come
Nine to feel

A bullet in my head
Finally
Picking through the lead
Who knew
It's inside of me?
So one more in my eye
And now
I can see
Just push me off the ledge
