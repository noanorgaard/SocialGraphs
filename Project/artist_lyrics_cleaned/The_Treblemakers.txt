You spin my head right 'round, right 'round
When you go down, when you go down down

Walk out that house with my swagger, hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious, I look at my Cartier, out of control
Just like my mind where I'm goin', no women, no shorties, no nothin', my clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on, woah

I know the storm is comin', my pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on and poppin' tonight 'cause it's meant be ours
We keep a fade-away shot 'cause we ballin', it's Platinum Patron every hour
Lil' mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl, you the truth with all that goodie power

You spin my head right 'round, right 'round
When you go down, when you go down, down

From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down

Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down
Shorty must know I'm the man, my money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands, my Benjamin Franklins
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands, my paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my hand
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand
She's amazin', her fire blazin', hotter than Cajun, girl, won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage, that body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze, that body is wavin' at me like, "Damn it, I told you"
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your chauffeur

I'm spendin' my money (Hey), I'm out of control (Hey)
Somebody help me, she's takin' my bankroll
But I'm king in the club (Hey) and I'm wearin' the crown (Hey)
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models, watchin' they asses go down, down

I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah

You're making staying over here impossible (Oh, oh, oh)
Baby I must say, your aura is incredible (Oh, oh, oh)
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you've started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rocking on the dancefloor, acting naughty
Your hands around my waist (Waist)
Just let the music play (Play)
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest and now we're face to face

These tricks that I'll attempt
Will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse
I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer
How 'bout you
With the eyes
Come on down to the front
And sit right here and don't be shy
So come one, come all
And see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded
No ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinnochio
I've never told a lie
They call me Mr. Magic Man
I float on cloud nine

I've got the magic in me
(I've got the magic baby)
Every time I touch that track
It turns into gold
(Oh yes, it turns into gold)
Everybody knows I've got the
Magic (x9)
(Donald: Come on clap your hands)

Awoooo
I've got the magic in
