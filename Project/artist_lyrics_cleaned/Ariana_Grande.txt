Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets (Swerve)
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up (Hold up), I know love can be a beach with no shore (Shore)
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four (Four)
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest (Oddest) couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
