My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree
But that's okay, that's the way I like to be

Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go

We went out late that night and we danced through the night, yeah
I was holding on to her and she be gripping me tight, she was
But she didn't care, I didn't mind
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind

My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree
But that's okay, that's the way I like to be

Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go, go, go
Just let yourself go

Hush little baby, don't say a word
I'd like to give you everything that you deserve
I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul
You can ask for my money, if you like you can have control
In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here
Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air
And if I cannot have you, I just don't want to live
Oh, I got so much I'd like to give

Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go (Come on, come on)
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go, go, go

Just let yourself go
(Hey Girl) My baby, my darling
Just let yourself go
(Hey Girl) My baby, my darling
I need to know
(Hey Girl) My sweetie, my lovely
I'd love to let you go
(Hey Girl) But I'm coming back for you
And I'm walking through your door
(Hey Girl)

Listen close and turn around
I know your heart can hear me now

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on your river and a fire in your sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
(Oh woah oh)
If you follow me, I'll follow you
(Oh woah oh)
If you follow me, I'll follow you

We could rule together
Walk this line forever
Damn this always weather
Blinds the way we know

But I'm good without ya
Yeah, I'm good without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

How many times can I break 'til I shatter?
Over the line, can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around
Give me a break, let me make my own pattern
All that it takes is some time, but I'm shattered
I always turn the car around

I had no idea that the night
Would take so damn long
Took it out, on the street
While the rain still falls
Push me back to you

Don't wanna turn that car around

Oh, 'til we make this right
Oh, I won't say goodnight

I just wanna make you laugh
I just wanna see that smile
Babe, we're only here, oh, for a little while
I just wanna hold you till we fall asleep
I want love, I want us, I want you, I want me, I want peace

Everybody needs a place
Somewhere that's warm and safe
A shelter from this crazy world we're in
But tonight I let the rain inside
And took away your place to hide
I'm sorry that I made you cry again
