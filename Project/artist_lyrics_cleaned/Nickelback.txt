If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you, would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you, would you?)
If today was your last day (Would you, would you?)
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try (Try, try)
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life (Would you, would you?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you, would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you, would you?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (Would you, would you?)
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?

Would you forgive your enemies? (Would you, could you?)
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?

Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
Cause you know momma's gonna hate that

The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In three, two, one

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman

Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low out on the backroads
The city lights are glowin' over the hill
And we can make it, but we take the chance of never coming back home

With our lives are better stolen

If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman
One for the road and one for those in heaven
One for the lord and take it from the devil
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide
Better run, better run, better run

We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light

Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar (Ooh)
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
I'll have the quesadilla, ha-ha
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(Does this make me look fat?)
So how you gonna do it?

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

'Cause you know
You know, you know

I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up

Oh, God, I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh

Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for

Look at this photograph

Every time I do, it makes 

Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday, I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Someday, somehow

Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror
