Clambering for the scraps
In the shatter of us collapsed
That cuts me with every could-have-been

Pain on pain on play repeating
With the backup, makeshift life in waiting

Everybody says
Time heals everything
But what of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between
Are we just going to wait it out?

There's nothing to see here now
Turning the sign around
We're closed to the earth 'til further notice
You might also like
A stumbling cliched case
Crumpled and puffy faced
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles

All I want, only one, street-level miracle
I'll be an out-in-out, born-again, from none more cynical

Everybody says
That time heals everything, all in the end
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between
Are we just going to wait it out?

And sit here cold, we will be long gone by then
In lackluster, in dust we layer on old magazines
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene
For all we could and should be being
In the one life that we've got

In the one life that we've got
Everybody says
That time heals everything
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between
Are we just going to wait it out?

And sit here
Just going to wait it out
And sit here cold
Just going to sweat it out
Wait it 

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first

Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this
Still life

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
Oh, you won't catch me around here
Blood and tears (Hearts)
They were here first

Mm, whatcha say?
Oh, that you only meant well?
Well, of course, you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Oh, that it's just what we need
And you decided this?
Whatcha say?
Oh, what did she say?

Ransom notes keep fallin' out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs (Paper word cut-outs)
Speak no feeling, no, I don't believe you
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
Ransom notes keep fallin' out your mouth
(Hide and seek)
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak, no feeling, no, I don't believe you
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit, you don't care a
