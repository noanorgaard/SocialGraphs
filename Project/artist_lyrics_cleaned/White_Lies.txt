Fate always loses hold
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hold
Now, be a good girl and do what you're told

If you tell me to jump, then I'll die
In my dreams, I'm there
I always hoped that I'd learn how to fly
In my dreams, I'm there
I leave my memoirs in blood on the floor
And my fears with the nurse on the stairs
I'm only going where you'll be someday
So, don't say, "Rest in peace" in your prayers

Fate always loses hold
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hold
Now, be a good girl and do what you're told

I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope you...

Fate always loses hold
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hold
Now, be a good girl and do what you're told

I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope you never forget about me...
I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope
