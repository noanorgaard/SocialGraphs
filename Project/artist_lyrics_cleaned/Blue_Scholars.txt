I compose fly music like Lalo Schifrin
Me and Bruce Lee, not so different
Be like water with the flow you dripping
Never catch Geo ego tripping
Broke hustlers see no pimping
But real rich fuckers will evict your building
Rewrote history to trick your children
To thinking this ship is not sinking
This shit is not working, the folks not working
Said "hold up" but it's not for certain
Got to hold on 'fore they drop those curtains
And they act like they did it but it's not on purpose
And they said we don’t deserve it
I'd rather be flawed with God than a soulless perfect
It's getting dark like the Montblanc ink
In the pen that I grip when I wrote these verses
Me vs me but the older version
And the collar's still blue and producer, Persian
New class like a Renaissance merchant
Hurting you bastards, you flirt with disaster
Rolling Rainier with the speakers blasting
D. Black and them cats flipping work with passion
I’ll be the first to reverse the fashion
Cause the trend won’t last but it might come back
You might also like
And it's time to make the matter matter again
Show you how to make a camera with a pad and a pen
2010, a spectacular end
Yes I'm back in the six let the battle begin
(Repeat x2)

There's no caliber like mine, survived a 45
A kind of cold guy specifically designed
To snuff my fine print inside of lines
And in about a minute I’ma take what’s mine
Came from thick a blood line of frontliners
Who puff lye, stand tall, covered all corners of the map
Oh when them browns gonna act?
Make money money, wait a minute send it back
Leave just a little for the liquor and the lab
Hawaii to Seattle, B-Town was the gap
Slapped by the teach' for having that bad grammer
Still passed all of my tests with bad manners
It's not a question who rocked it the baddest, from 14th and Maddison
Nonchalant laughing at you non-factors chattering
Thank you for speaking and keeping my name traveling
This ain't no comparison, without being arrogant
A rare kind of nation
I'm there like three Bloody Mary's in the mirror
I tear now, the new people listen here
Fear no bullets, hear no music
If I can't feel nothin' then I can't see through it
I can't do it, I can't do it
Rhyme fluid whether or not my mind's looted
I'm not losing or seeming otherwise this foolish, huh
Boom, boom, pow
Boom, boom, boom, pow

Boom, boom, pow
Boom, boom, boom,
