I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might
'Cause when you walked by. I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye. You’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up
Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up
And if you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance. Damn

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it
I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end
Ha, your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’
But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently
So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it
I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

In this light, you’re lookin’ like you’re inflight
Pretty voice, put a ribbon on you’re wind pipe
Silly girl, you’ve been playin’ with me all night
But we can work it out, I been on my gym hype
Yeah, I heard you had a boyfriend and stuff and
I was just calling to tell you that its cool cause
My other girlfriend got one too haha
So I told her like

So, I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’

My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was 

I'm so fly-y-y-y-y
Every time I'm walking by-y-y-y-y
All the girlies saying hi-i-i-i-i
I'm just doin' what I want, I'm as cool as the Fonz
I'm so fly-y-y-y-y

I wanna stay fly but not in the sense of heights
Not like airplanes or the sense of kites
And if I could then I would put this ink in a pipe
'Cause that's sorta like the feeling that I get when I write (uh)
Call Amelia Earhart, tell her let's elope
We could meet the airport
From there on we're living life without a care at all
Superfly, Mary Poppins with a parasol
I got a couple more stairs to crawl
Good thing I'm not scared to fall
Not at all, not even a little bit
Birds eye view so everything looking different
Yeah, I got a brand new angle
Devil on my shoulder turned into a blue angel
With a new halo, gravity on pay roll
So we ain't coming down until we say so

I'm so fly-y-y-y-y
Every time I'm walking by-y-y-y-y
All the girlies saying hi-i-i-i-i
I'm just doin' what I want, I'm as cool as the Fonz

Every time I'm walking by-y-y-y-y
All the girlies saying hi-i-i-i-i
I'm just doin' what I want, I'm as cool as the Fonz (ayy!)
I see 'em dancin' on the rooftops
So put another dime in the jukebox
Turn it up, turn it up lets go
Bang it 'til your speakers blow
Everybody say oh (oh), oh (oh)
Oh (oh), oh (oh)
I'm the coolest thing since ice
I'm the-I'm the-I'm the coolest thing since ice

I'm so fly-y-y-y-y
Every time I'm walking by-y-y-y-y
All the girlies saying hi-i-i-i-i

This is that shit, speakers in back shit
That drive slow like your stuck in some Cali traffic
My main squeeze riding shottie, she kinda ratchet
Rollin' up a doobie while putting on cherry Chapstick (Woop)
Throwback whip, cut the tunes on
James Dean Porsche, the fuckin' roofs gone
Surfer cut got me lookin' like Jimmy Neutron
Beach Bum Billionaire crashin' on Izzle's futon
That's how we do, ugh, California poster kid
Hate it if you want we're doing everything you supposed to did
Give me the pen and I turn into George Lucas
I'm the shit, you're losin' if you're spittin' I'm mucus
I'm so stupid with bars they cut my tab off
Called me a cab, I looked at them like that bad, huh?
They said "yeah, yeah", black zipper jacket bad
Oh dag, blah blah blah, rapper swag

Dirty Vans
Blue Jeans
Ray Bans
Cool things
Rebel shit, I'm doing me
Fuck your swag, James Dean

Aww yeah, hot to death
Word to the Bible, God, I'm fresh
Never live another day broke
I'm a die with a smile on my face 'cause life's a joke
Ugh, I'm so cold, got so many girls and they all wanna rock
Slow like a robot, moves like Robocop
So many drugs in the game
But they're not really dope, they're just that soda pop
Everybody wants a little fame, man, so do I
Everybody wants to kick game, man, Cobra Kai
Been told I am the shit
The sewer, manure
So I'm sure I'm sewage as it gets
So now every year's a piece of cake
Life is just beach and lakes
Tons of fish up in the sea
I'm the poll, she's the bait
Never gonna die, I'm hoping I'm
On a gremlin trip, gonna multiply
But I picked out a wedding dress for that chick
Death is comin', fuck that bitch
Aw yeah, love is just so beautiful
You blow a kiss and promise wind 'til your funeral
But I got parties going on, got no room for hoes
Someone pull the tag, I got that rapper swag
Dirty Vans
Blue jeans
Ray-Bans
Cool things
Rebel shit, I'm doing me
Fuck your swag, James Dean

James Dean

Got a petite bride, I call her sweet ride
She love to drive me nuts, gave her the green light
If I'm not cool then I don't know what cool is
Swept her off her feet now, we gonna jump the broom and
Get this party on yeah, I'm so California
You can find me up in your crib surfing on lawn chairs
Barbie dolls, blonde hair, you can find them all here
But I just call them sharks 'cause there's nothing but some jaws here
Ice cold so I'm never gonna freeze up
Super high but I never roll trees
Got a lead foot so I'll never ease up
Like the alphabet stopped right after D
Will someone please call the police
Or EMT's when they drop that beat
Yellow tape it's a crime scene
I'm about to murder my rhyme scheme
RIP when the bass on hit
Make a t-shirt, put my verse face on it
Shit, something like a space cadet
Throwback yeah like a tape cassette
And if you wanna play roulette but want the safest bet
Then put your money on the fresh, yep
Mouth full of Listerine, Mister Dean

Fuck your swag, James
