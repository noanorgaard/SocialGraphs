In the moon of the budding trees
I was gifted new eyes to see
All of the shifting shape and ways you can be
Wake the dreams into realities
Wake the dreams into realities
Sunset diamonds trickle down our cheeks
The language of no words is how we speak
Pachamama spinning firelight
And a Little Bear singing by the fireside
Out of this city with the wind on our neck, check
That's us whistling upon your neck
Moonlit diamonds sparkle into my mouth
Feels like hunger and it tastes like salt
Feels like hunger and it tastes like salt

So, tap me out and tap me into you
Heal my brain and my body too
Balance my chemistry, hydrate these cells
Cause the body talks and meditation helps
The body talks and meditation helps
You might also like
A little bit of cinnamon pours as we snoot
All up on my shit in the morning commute
Coastal quiver on a quest through the dunes
Sandy toes and bottomless curves of the moon
Heavy lifting for Pele's children
Hand of the goddess, soaking cliffs keep building
Plate is full but appetite has dwindled
I feel a little sick so I keep the fire kindled
You, the pillar, steadfast light of bravery
And I, the dimly burning candle still shaking
Riddled fear, quiver my bones so easy
Well, you're the guru now so visualize healing
Yeah, you're the guru now so visualize leaving
Let her go, for she can no longer feed you
And many children need that mana creature
Just barely missed you, I was finally ready
But you are long gone, too much heavy history
Yeah, you are a long gone, too much heavy history
Let go of blame, that shit will never serve me
Bless other men, investigate your mystery

So, tap me out and tap me into you
Heal my brain and my body too
Balance my chemistry, hydrate these cells
Cause the body talks and meditation helps
The body talks and meditation helps
A little spider weaves a wispy web
And stumbling through the woods, it catches to my head
She crawls behind my ear and whispers secrets
Dragonfly wiz by and sings "now teach it"
Yeah, dragonfly wiz by and sings "now teach it"
Fork on the trail, I watched you head up mauka
I turn makai and whisper "thank you, sister"
Edge of the west, where water touches land
You are the east with folded maps in hand
Time to increase my frequency
Hands of light and bodies talking, yeah
Give me some of that wild fox medicine
But keep me here in this wild present tense
Fully supported on new lover's chest
Dawning adventures sparkle, get some rest
Dawning adventures sparkle, get some rest

So, tap me out and tap me into you
Heal my brain and my body too
Balance my chemistry, hydrate these cells
Cause the body talks and meditation helps
The body talks and meditation helps

And then I made this song about it
So it was like it went from dream world
To drawing, to writing, to... life
To music,
