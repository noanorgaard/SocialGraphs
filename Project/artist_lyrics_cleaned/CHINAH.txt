Your moves affect my style
Your lips attract the carefree light I see
Those lines we never say
Those times you lick my shoulder blades instead
Your moves affect my style
Your lips attract the carefree light I see
We don't recall the names
It's not to be described and we don't try

Whenever you want me, hah
Whenever you want me
Whenever you want me, hah
Whenever you want me
Whenever you want me, hah

Damn, have you heard about patience
'Cause that's how it isn't in the hood when your famous

My cousins take pictures, we use to be strangers
Have some lips turn into ravens
My ex-girl is angry, she showered me nameless
And my team is intact
We smoke good and try to relax
Pashing around, don't turn the music down
I'm looking around, I'm floating with all these clouds
Pashing around, don't turn the music down
I'm looking around, I see you look profound
Whenever you want me
Whenever you want me
