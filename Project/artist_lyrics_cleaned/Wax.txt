I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a fuck about a DUI
You can take away my license
But you can't take away my pride
I'm singing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I'ma keep drinking 'til the day I die
Two wheels is the way I ride

I got my backpack strapped on my back real tight
Inside of it got a cord and a mic
And a couple tall cans, Coors and Bud Light
That I found in my refrigerator drawer from the night before
I take flight out the door with my bike
It's such a Californian sight
Small breeze got the palm trees swaying back and forth in the light
Melodies in my head, I'm gon' record 'em tonight, man
I start pedalin', I start smilin'
I'm in the bike lane freestylin'
I make a quick pit stop on the corner
To pet a little dog and chat with its owner
It's the type of day you just can't feel bad
The same type of day Ice Cube once had
Tryna make it to the lab but I don't pedal fast
I sit back and watch as the rose pedals pass

Cruising down Sherman, a couple blocks left
Rhymes in my head and they're all kinda deaf
Man, I can't wait to lay 'em down but my first venture
Is to the store for a couple more thirst quenchers
I pick 'em up and then add them to the contents
Of my heavy ass bag then I pedal fast, no nonsense
Hit the studio with no delayin'
I give a dap to my homie Bailey on the way in
I start drinkin', I start recordin'
Three hours later I'm out the damn door again
Gotta pedal to the store again
I'm feeling festive, this requires Captain Morgan
Another bike ride, staring at a night sky
Trying not to swerve as the cars fly right by
I stay fresh like fucking bagged salad
And I don't give a damn if my license ain't valid
I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a fuck about a DUI

My chick is one out of a million, she a grand prize
Met her on the dash bus up in Van Nuys
That pretty face, accent, and them tan thighs
Make me fantasize all day, I hit it like

Boom, boom, ayy

Ayy, yo, me and her've been together for like a couple months
Mami got that punani sweeter than peanut butter crunch
I hit it from the back like a sucker punch
Bust a nut, back to the front for some uppercuts
And in the mornin' she be hookin' me up proper
Butt-naked in my kitchen while she cookin' me machaca
And before I go to work, she give me that boom-shaka-laka
I want to stay home and fuck her all day, I hit it like

Yo, lotta joy, lotta pleasure, lotta pain, lotta misery
She turn me on, but she be drainin' me physically
And I mean that quite literally
'Cause I only got so many mini-mes swimmin' in me
Man, I give it all I got, but still she wants to get some more
Back to the bathroom, back to the bedroom
Back to the hall, to the kitchen floor
I don't know what I'm bitchin' for, 'cause I like it that way
And all I wanna do all day is hit it like

Boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
Gonna hit it like, boom, boom, ayy
