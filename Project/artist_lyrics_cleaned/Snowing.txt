A minor case; major depressive
A fantastic film score
My father's bike; my weight descending
With nothing to wait for

Then I push my hair back
Then I mess it up
Then I bite my tongue from singing
What you'll all say

"You swore that you would live your life without regret"
Well, I
Well what do you wait for?

Melissa, I fucked up
I won't, I won't cut my arms off
That won't keep me warm at night
And I'll do my best to live my life without regretYou might also 

Because I feel nothing, like my father
Oh, he's been sleeping underground
Don't wait around
'Cause there's nothing there at all, there's nothing but the end

You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)
So I'll just stay home
(I'm talking to you)
You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)
You're fucking gone
Gone, gone

I feel nothing
Like my father
He's been sleeping
UndergroundYou might also
