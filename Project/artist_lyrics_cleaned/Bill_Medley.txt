Now I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt like this before
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency

Yes, I know what's on your mind

So I'll tell you something

Because
I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear (Yes, I swear) it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Never felt this way
'Til I found the truth
And I owe it all to you


Now I've (I've) had the time of my life (Ooh)
No, I never felt this way before (Never felt this way)
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before (Never felt this way)
Yes, I swear it's the truth (It's the truth)
And I owe it all to you (It's true)
'Cause I had the time of my life (Never felt this way)
(I've had the time of my life) And I've searched through every open door
You do it to me, baby (It's true)
'Til I found (Do it to me, baby) the truth
I And I owe it all to
