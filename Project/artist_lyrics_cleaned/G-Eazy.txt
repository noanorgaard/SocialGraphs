I've been sitting on the charts like a beach chair
My last album spent 52 weeks there
Almost finished with the second, you should be scared
Storms coming you should go inside and prepare
No shortcuts there ain't no cheats there
I brought the whole city out like a street fair, yeah
And fuck it I'm the coldest white rapper in the game
Since the one with the bleached hair
Yeah, you love it when I talk shit
I get around, yeah I'm on my 2Pac shit
I kinda feel there's no girl I could not get
I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah, it's nothing that no one can tell me
I made it here dolo, nobody to help me
From the Bay, the birthplace of the hyphy

If I like her, all this shit will really take is a double tap
Having visions of fucking an A-list singer, Kardashian, or a Jenner
But Ye's got Kim, Tyga swooped up Kylie
So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah, they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound
Up and down on a Wednesday

Five years too deep
Two birds, one seat
Two girls, one but
This dick ain’t free
In the hills, so steep
Need the mills like I'm Meek
And like a mountain top
Your career quite peak
In her mouth like a cheek
Skip the bitch like a beat
Snort cocaine, drink, then repeat
I ain’t slept in 'bout like a week
See, this lifestyle, it ain’t cheap
But when I pop bottles, it’s free
Tell all my bruddas we all in the section
But trust me, the section, it isn't on me
See the flow, I dun did it
Poppin' off like prescription
Kill the beat, G the witness
Call me Jack how I rip this
Poker cards how I flip this
Your main hoe is my fitness
I like 'em stick-thin and titless
I pray to God as my witness
I pray I make right decisions
‘Cause if I left, they’d be trippin’
Without a suit, I make business
Forced out to cash lyrics

It ain't funny what I've been through
Your enemy can be some kin to you
I started off hella broke
Hung around people that's older than me, took notes
Momma worked three jobs on the weekends
Used to help her wash the walls at Mare island
In Vallejo naval houses
Havin' a roof over my head was my allowance
The oldest of four, young adults
Surrounded by grief, big dreams and hope
They hated and they doubted
How did you take it? Took it with a grain of salt
I wanted it badly, they couldn't stop me, Indie
Erry label wanted to sign me
Grew up on Short and Freddie B
(Who else?) Magic Mike and Calvin T

From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts
More butts, more bucks, never giving more fucks
Did it my way, I'm never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool, who put you upon?
Huh, E-40, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay ooh-kay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

And I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say "Fuck y'all!" to all of y'all faces
It changes though, now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely
This shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't wanna work for it — tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)

Yeah, back when the first time we met
I was thinkin' 'bout sex but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression
But it's not everyday someone comes and leaves an impression
Typin' shit to say to you then deletin' it on my phone when I'm textin'
Cause I still be thinkin' about you like every day, no question
But, I ain't really tryin' to fly out
And I'm no good at phones
And my life is on the road
I'm with the crew of Rolling Stones, but don't trip

But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly
When I leave it's over
I come to my senses when I'm sober
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuck, and that shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're havin' a thought
Picture us having a spot
But look at this baggage I got
My life is crazy, I travel a lot
But, when I dip out in the morning you can trust

I'm trying to marry Kate Upton
Blow this money too quickly
To them squares who trying to hate: fuck them
You can't catch me, I move too swiftly
I'm always going through customs
When I leave, I'm knowing you miss me
We run through bottles like nothin'
Like I'm tryna drown in this whiskey
Indulge in everything we wish
We drink it straight with no mixers
Got bitch drinks if you squeamish
At the after parties, no pictures
My bag of trees looks greenish
Got a bad bitch to roll swishers
This lifestyle's the sweetest
Man, I'm shining now just like fixtures
Yeah, do it for my city
Everywhere I go, bro, I rep the Bay
Yeah, tell you it's a pity
But hating fucks always got shit to say

My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then

Lookin' at your face and I'm thinking' about the place where I met you at
Yeah, and since day one, you supported these dreams
Always stayed right by my side
Trust, I notice these things
Even way, way back
When my buzz was dead like bee stings
Broke as ever, when your vision's far it's tough to see things
And whenever we ate out, we might split an entree
Bank account with $3k, that's no relation to Andre
And that would be a hot day save for rain, that's what my moms say
I think just putting cash away is what she was trying to convey
Cause money comes, money goes; People switch to funny roles
Anyone would tell you that one good girl's worth twenty ho's
Soon as I get right I'mma take care of you
Swear I'm so prepared to love you
Know it's no one there above you

My whole life has changed

What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM, staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out "fuck that!"
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that, I wanna take you now
Let's do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there, I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real, ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything, then you have bliss
Then she told me this

Awesome, I'm naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe, so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble, she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace, I don't mean Danny Granger
Can't wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
"Let's do this right now" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...

Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

Take me down

Rapper working in the business, wait, I never thought of that
Just take a look at the scores, I put numbers up on the boards
I'm in a section with models
And you're at the bar tryna get at a cluster of fours
When that bottle pours I just keep drinking it straight
And get faded and pass out on floors
Homies like "Bro, that's my girl, what the fuck are you doing?"
Oops, ain't know that was yours!

Better learn your algebra and your decimals too
Cause you square motherfuckers can't mess with my crew

They kiss on the dick, I caress on the boobs

Fuck boy talking out of turn
My brothers leave you sleeping in an urn

It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under the rug 'til I'm trippin' on the pile
Did it change somethin' different for a while?
Yeah, we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotels, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless? (Oh!)
Tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don't know where I am (Ooh)
But I just know I'm driftin' (Driftin') far from you (Ooh, yeah)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (Woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you (Ha)
Don't you know we driftin' off, driftin' off? (Ooh)
I know you think that it's my fault we fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault that far apart
Ooh, and now I'm missin' your love

Yeah, catching shots from head to toe
I don't need no medic though
A modern Gatsby chasing Daisy, I should have let it go
But you never know
I might have dreamed too high, rather way too low
'Cause you wouldn't stick around back when I wasn't making dough
Till you see a poster with my face for me to play a show
And your friends are like "He made it now! Fucking way to go"
Used to dream about becoming rich
You ain't see the vision
I ain't make it fast enough for you so you ain't stickin' with him
I used to think about a life with you and music I was wishin'
For them both but you ain't see it 'till I brought one to fruition
But for some reason, now and then I still consider
The what-ifs and the maybes but that shit just makes me bitter, see
