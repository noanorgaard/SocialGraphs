When I was young my dad
Would treat my mom real bad
Every time the Utah Jazz would lose
He'd start a-drinking
And I'd start a-thinking
How am I gonna keep my mom from getting abused?
I'd see her all scared and my soul was dying
My dad would say to me: "Now, don't you dare start crying"
Turn it off

Like a light switch
Just go flick
It's our nifty little Mormon trick
Turn it off
Turn
It
Off

My sister was a dancer, but she got cancer
The doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time, so I got in line
For the (new iPhone) at the (Apple Store)
She lay there dying with my father and motherHer very last words were "Where is my brother?"

Turn it off
Yeah!
Bid those sad feelings adieu

The fear I might get cancer too
When I was in fifth grade
I had a friend, Steve Blade (Ooh, Steve Blade)
He and I were close
As two friends could be (We could be close)
One thing led to another
And soon I would discover (Wow!)
I was having really strange feelings for Steve
I thought about us, on a deserted island (We're all alone)
We'd swim naked in the sea
And then he'd try and...
WOAH! Turn it off!
Like a light switch
There it's gone
Good for you!
My hetero side just won!
I'm all better now
Boys should be with girls
That's heavenly father's plan
So if you ever feel
You'd rather be with a man
Turn it off!
Well, Elder McKinley, I think it's okay that you're having gay thoughts, just so long as you never act upon them

No, 'cause then you're
Just keeping it down
Like a dimmer switch
On low
On low
Thinking nobody needs to know!
Uh oh

But that's not true!

Being gay is bad
But lying is worse
So just realize you have
A curable curse
And turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off!
(The ELDERS dance.)

Turn it off!

Now, how do you feel?

The same

Then you've only got yourself to blame
You didn't pretend hard enough
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes
And find the box that's gay and CRUSH IT!
Okay?

No, no, I'm not having gay thoughts!

Alright! It worked!

Yay!
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Like a light switch just go click (Click click!)
What a cool little Mormon trick! (Trick trick!)
We do it all the time!

When you're feeling certain feelings

That just don't seem right
Don't seem right
Treat those pesky feelings
Like a reading light
A reading light
Turn it off
Like a light switch on a cord
Now he isn't gay anymore

Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
Turn it

Turn it
