I do love you
I do, ooh-ooh, love you

And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devicesYou might also 

If there's anything to say
If there's anything to do
If there's any other way
I'll do anything for you

I was dressed embarrassment, I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?

Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If we ever make a mess
I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father, or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

To be alone with me

Drag me to hell in the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling its fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the crossYou might also 

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out, just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more

La, la, la
La-la-la-la-la
La, la, la
La-la-la-la-la

So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I’m right?
Oh no, I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no, I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time

He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

And in my best behavior
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floorboards
For the secrets I have 

But I was on the hatch
I was on the avalanche
And I had found my match
I was on the floor

I took a train from Virginia
To Illinois, my home
He said “I knew you had it in you"
A mind to make its own

But I was on the hatch
Riding on the avalanche
I tried to take it back
I was on the floor

Come on, Stone!
Come on, Star!
Come on, Snow!
Come on, Car!
Come on, Hands!
Come on, Feet!
Come on, Face!
Come on, Street!
Come on, State!
Come on, Song!
Move it fast! (Take it up)
Move it along! (The Ohio River)
Come on, Life! (Take it up)
Come on, Lord! (Take it over)
Make it right! (To the Mississippi)
Make it Yours!You might also
