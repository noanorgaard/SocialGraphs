What a dark father to dwell in me
I must be the devil's daughter
Such a dark father to dwell in me
Bastard child that I am
You can see it in my swagger
In the palmist lines of my hands
And my lips that bud like daggers
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'
I think I'm on a mission
Should I then shield my eyes
From the furtive looks of babes-in-arms
And the cries of their poor mothers
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'

And I think, like him, I have to roam
With what each night delivers
It's time to make my drive be known
Turn lads into believers
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'
Look out young son
Look out young son
Look out young son
When I bloom you come a-crawlin'
I must be the devil's daughter
What a dark father to dwell in me
I must be the devil's daughter
Such a dark father to dwell in
