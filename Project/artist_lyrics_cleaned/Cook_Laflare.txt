Who is in the driveway
Ugly ass nigga in a lovely ass i8
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye

Foreigns in the driveway
Ugly ass nigga in a lovely ass i8
She love the way my foreigns skate
Up and down the interstate
On the way back with them K's
Hating, that's a bitch trait
Niggas looking for them packs, I got gas like Ginobili
All these plug prices got the streets in a chokehold
Bitches on my dick 'cause I'm ballin' just like Ocho
They didn't want a record, I didn't sauced up till I was solo

Lamborghinis, you never seen it
Foreigns in bikinis, I got game like Luigi
Countin' money, it's therapeutic
My gate is closed, the game is hitting in the music
Don't pass me no prescription 'cause I might abuse it
It's a hard job but someone gotta do it
That Glock my bodyguard, word to Whitney Houston
Say you got a movement, but your movement never moving
Put some money on your head, that's an execution
Flexin on the gram, call that an illusion
I've been winning so long, I know you sick of losing
Poppin' bottles in the club we was the first to do it

Trappin' is my occupation
I sit by myself, I call that isolation
Fired in a plane, call that aviation
Told my OG I want M's, he told me Cook be patient
Junkies in the hallway, foreigns in the driveway
Cookie in the ashtray
Which way, tell that bitch the my way
Know I sold a lot of plays, swear to God we all street
Higher than the stars, call that outta limit
I don't do Pradas, these them Raf Simons
I take a trip to Cali, then it's back to business
I took a couple losses, but it's back to winning
