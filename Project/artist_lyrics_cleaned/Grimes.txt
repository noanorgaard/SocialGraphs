Oh, where is my heart?
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Where is my heart?
I can never tell her
That she is a witch
Sewing up my heart
Get love in equal stitch

Oh, I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Oh, I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not

Morning, morning, morning
Will wake me up cold
Morning, morning, morning
Reminds me that I am getting old, 

Throw a ball, it's bouncing off the wall
That's how I heard music first
Did I really need it?
How can something so free feel so rehearsed?

Calculate the entropy
Running out of energy
A lack of love or empathy
Leave me lonely
Calculate the entropy
Bitter path in front of me
Oh neither friend or enemy
Leave me lonely

Every day I let the music play
It seems to play by itself
Did I let it bleed me?
Did I hit it back until it bled itself?

How can they stay in the sky?

Maybe it's not music and it's all a lie

Living up, giving up
When I go, can I go with you, you
When I go, can I go with-
Go, go, go, go, go with
(Go with)
Go, go, go, go, go
(Blood diamonds)

Happy scenes, a stupid dream when I dream of you
They don't stay, it might all be delusion, but I couldn't say
And I'd like to think that we don’t drink just to drink, you know
Cause I've been here

Living up, give it up
When I go, can I go with you, you
When I go, can I go with-
Go, can I go with-

1 ContributorTranslationsEnglishGrimes — World Princess part II (tradução em português) Lyrics
Eu tenho um grande sonho, mas um pequeno mundo no meio do caminho:
Eu e tudo que não consigo fazer
Não foi um dia ruim, só mais ou menos
Eu tenho a impressão de que você sugou a vida do quarto

Eu sei que eu provavelmente era
Só um pensamento frágil e tosco na sua cabeça
Não seja cruel
Você nem se compara a mim

Mas eu não consigo ver nada além
Das coisas que você tenta tomar de mim
Agora, quem é que está errado?
Não chore

São minhas
São minhas

Eu vi o desfile, o grande banda, o baile dе máscaras
Então o que te traz aos meus pés?
Dе volta à primeira página
Você não fez nada além de envelhecer
Oh, não há nada que poderia estar mais completo que isso

Mas eu não consigo ver nada além

Não chore

São minhas
São minhas

Apague a luz
Na sua cabeça, no seu coração, na sua emoção oculta
Onde as águas se encontram
Apague a luz
Na sua cabeça, no seu coração, na sua emoção oculta
Onde as águas se encontram

Mas eu não consigo ver nada além
Das coisas que você tenta tomar de mim
Agora, quem é que está errado?
Não chore
São minhas
São minhas
São minhas
São minhas
São minhas

Se eu olhar na escuridão, não saberei onde estou
Não vejo a luz do dia desde que comecei a desistir
Meus olhos estão pesados, meus pés estão lentos
Como um homem em forma, e não uma 

See you on a dark night (La-la-la-la-la)
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night (La-la-la-la-la)
See you on a dark night

And no, I'm not a jerk
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
You know it's good to be tough like me
But I would wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you've got to watch your health"
