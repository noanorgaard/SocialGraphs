Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here"
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said, "Mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without"
"Tell me, sir, what am I going to do
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes"
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
"Mama's gonna look so great"

I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me, what Christmas is all about
