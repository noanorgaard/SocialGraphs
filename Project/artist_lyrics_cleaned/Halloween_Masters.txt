I am the Hampire! Watch out on Halloween night
I am a hammier vampire then anyone from Twilight
I implore you, when you hear me at your door invite me in

Not by hair on your chinny chin chin!

I don't like garlic with my steak, in fact I don't like stakes at all
I just snack on necks for breakfast
Gonna make a withdrawl
From the blood bank, "Thanks!"
Or should I say "Fangs a lot"
Trick or treat, you're the other white meat now
In case you forgot

I am the Hampire, the swine vampire
I'm the king of mastication
I'm the best biter
I am the Hampire, the swine vampire
I'm the king of freaky creatures, there is none finer
Don't misunderstand me
I don't want you candy
All I want's your blood
Trick or trot
Smell my hooves
Give me all the blood I choose
I can't get enough
You might also like
I am the Zombeef!
And I am more than you can handle
Cuz' this bovine spits more rhymes then even Dan Bull
I rock more cowbell than Christopher Walken Dead
You shoulda' ran wee wee wee home
But you keep talking instead
You act like Dr.Acula but you ain't even a resident
Evil flows through me call me Umbrella Corp president
I don't graze on grains
Brains remain my favorite chow
You shoulda' known better than to mess with a mad cow

I am the Zombeef!
The bull zombie
I am the beast who eats the feast between your ears
I am the Zombeef, the bull zombie
Simply put I am the sum of all your fears
When I'm at you residence I don't want your M&Ms
All I want's your brains
I don't say trick or treat
All I want's your skull meat
I must feed again!

Zip it, Zombeef, or I'll put you out to pasture
Let me spell it out for you
I am the true master
That is a Type~O Positively shameless
I couldn't eat your brains because your clearly brainless
Thats utter bull
I preform unutterable acts in the bat of an eye
The game is up, the time is high
Its time to say goodbye
Move aside
We are the undead zombie herd
All of my cattle are ready to battle
Think you can win? Thats just absurd!

UNI~CORN!
