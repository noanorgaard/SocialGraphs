Once she graduated Jr. High
She started working overtime
Scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines
Just so she could help her mother out
And after college, they moved into Marvin's Garden
And she got a job working at the city water department
To save enough cash
To move into Community Chest Condos on Pennsylvania Ave
She fell in love with this dude name Ray
Who was a small-time hustler from St. Charles' Place
And he was known for always being in and out of trouble
But the problem was that he was never on her level (no)
She argued with her mom about Ray's work
Till he got sent upstate on the same say that she gave birth
But see the baby never made it
It drove her nearly crazy and she couldn't take it

But now look at her
She's got this game on lock

Listen, see where she came from
Many people find it hard just to hang on
You often find them in the same place complaining
Instead of finding a better way of maintaining
She could have balled up and cried
And wished that she would die
And just gave up on trying
Instead, she grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom
Now she's on top and she's flying

But now look at her
She's got this game on lock
Anything that she ever wanted
Now she got it
