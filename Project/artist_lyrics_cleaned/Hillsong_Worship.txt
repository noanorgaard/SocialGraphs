I'll walk through the fire with my head lifted high
And my spirit revived in Your story
And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost

God forever You reign
And my soul will find refuge
In the shadow of Your wings

Still my hope will cling to Your promise

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

And oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee

Sent of heaven, God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee

Behold the empty tomb

He's risen from the grave!
