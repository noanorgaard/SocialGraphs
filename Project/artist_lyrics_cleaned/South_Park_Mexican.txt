I know that I must be high so that I can function

I'ma use my three wishes, I'm very superstitious
No matter where I go, I meet a bunch of horny bitches
Burn a few bridges, feed a few pigeons
Fuck 'em so good they wake up and wash dishes
The food was delicious; bacon, eggs, and biscuits
No French kisses and no hippopotamuses
I'm picky, if you strictly dickly, you can't get with me
As I represent Houston like word to damn Whitney
I'ma get 'em when I get 'em I loved 'em and I fed 'em
Live in peace, I ain't gon' let 'em, when I see 'em I'ma wet 'em
Shut 'em down like D-Town and my homie Ackavelie
Peace to Happareli and my nigga John Freddy
My drink is thick as jelly; I love my shit muddy
Four of us in this bitch and we gon' do them boys ugly
Ready for the rumble, leave 'em lying in a puddle
Y'all don't really want no trouble with the lord of the jungle

I walks in the club, all grabbing on my dick as the police officers pattin' down my click
They say my bandana breaks the dress code
Every fine fuckin', bitch I sees my ex-hoe
I'm hoggin' and I'm doggin', creepin' and I'm crawlin'
Believe me, this my callin', it's time to do you all in
Everybody jump-jump, boys trip, what-what
Let my double barrel shotty go barump-pa-pump-pum
Slangin' slam or the rocks up in no man’s land
Burnin off in my "Smokey and the Bandit" Trans Am
The rope around my neck is just danglin' and janglin'
Sometime I smoke the rain and get wetter than a penguin
Aunt Jemima sipper, hoes like Jack Tripper
Peace to Big Dipper, what the deal, mys nigga?
Hook like "Johnny” Tapia, it's Dopehouse living prosperous
I tip my waitress, and she can't stop saying, "Gracias"
