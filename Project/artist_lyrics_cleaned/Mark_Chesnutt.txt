Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Said it played a sad song that made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty-five
Bubba shot the jukebox last night

Bubba ain't never been accused
Of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breath
Until he laid that colt on the table
He hung his head till the cops showed up
They dragged him right out of Margie's
Told him "Don't you play dumb with us, son"
"You know damn well what the charge is."

Went to his truck and got a forty-five
Well, he shot the jukebox last night

Well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
The confrontation was a tense one
Shook his head and said, "Bubba Boy,"
"You was always a dense one."
A reckless discharge of a gun
That's what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered, "Reckless! Hell!"
"I hit just where I was aiming."

Through the teardrops in his eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
It was justifiable homicide

Stopped it with one shot
