Creep into your mind, yeah

Rip away the tears
Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

What would you say?
Don't drop the big one
If you a monkey on a string
Don't cut my lifeline
If you a doggie on a chain
Don't bite the mailman
What would you say?

Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end

We could do anything, baby

Not falling, but rising, like rolling around

Eyes closed, we're gonna spin through the stars
Our arms wide as the sky
We gonna ride the blue all the way to the end of the world
To the end of the world

I am no Superman, I have no reasons for you

But I do know one thing
Is where you are is where I belong

The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mind
Is a space we'll fill with time
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain

Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song

The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war

Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath, his baby’s being born

It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water

With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

Watch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying

Lights down, you up and die

She feeds him well his concerns
He forgets them
And remembers being small
Playing under the table and dreaming

All these cars end up on the sidewalk
People in every direction
No words exchanged
No time to exchange

Red and black antennae waving
They all do it the same

Candyman tempting the thoughts of a
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss
Program cutting the corners
Loose end, loose end, cut, cut
On the fence, could not to offend
Cut, cut, cut, cut

Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
