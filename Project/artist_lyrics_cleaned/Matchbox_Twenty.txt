I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
But it's feelin' just like every other mornin' before
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone
The cars are movin' like a half a mile an hour and I
Started starin' at the passengers wavin' goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burnin' to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well, I believe it all is comin' to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

I think it turned ten o'clock, but I don't really know
Then I can't remember carin' for an hour or so
Started cryin' and I couldn't stop myself
I started runnin', but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
Said, "Where you goin', man? You know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to"

But I believe it all is comin' to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come (Again)
Let's see how far we've come

It's gone, gone, baby, it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well, it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you
Well, it's gone, gone, baby, it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well, it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you

Well, this ain't over

She said, "I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrustin'
When I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"

Well, well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
Yeah, well, I can't change, oh
Well, I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around
Well, I will, well, I will

Just wait a minute, well, it kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this, baby

I wonder what it's like to be a superhero
I wonder where I'd go when I could fly around downtown, yeah
From some other planet, I get this funky high on a yellow sun
Boy, I bet my friends will all be stunned
They're stunned (Yeah, yeah)

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here?
If I was someone else, would this all fall apart?
Strange, where were you when we started this gig?
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

To you
And you
And me

Well, I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho
I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I said (Just what I said)
Well, I'd shout out an order, "I think we're out of this, man, get me some"
Boy, don't make me wanna change my tone
My tone (Yeah, yeah)

Hold on
Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong
