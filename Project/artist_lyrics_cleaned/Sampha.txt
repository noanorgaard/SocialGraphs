Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out

I don't mind your tongue inhibition

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work

I can't stay forever, but if this would go straight
I conquered the catastrophe
