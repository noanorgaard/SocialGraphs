Never ever get enough
Shades on, hays on
Baby, are we cool enough
Face up, make-up
Making all the boys stop
Sweet talk, cherry pop
Oh yeah, this is all we've got
She's been a bad bad girlfriend
Now she wants to try it all out
And there's no stopping her now, now now
I, I, I, I, I just wanna lose my mind
Just for this one night
Flying high, 'cause we only got one night
Baby, are we cool enough
Need sucks, pulled back all the way
Daddy's got credit card, chilling with the green stuff
Get enough time and??
Maybe you should take that off
Wasted, fading now everybody's tired up
I, I, I, I, I just wanna lose my mind
Just for this one night
Flying high, 'cause we only got one night
Baby, are we cool enough
You might also likeWe've been real real bad now
Though we wanted try it all out
Do we ever stop now?
Baby, are we cool enough
Oh, why should we ever stop
Oh, we're never gonna stop
Turned out for what?!
Take me away away
Need my escape escape
Take me away away
Need my escape escape
Baby, are we cool
