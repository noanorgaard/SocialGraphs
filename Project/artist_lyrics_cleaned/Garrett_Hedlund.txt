Come on, come on
Into my arms
Come on, come on
Give in to me

You're gonna take my hand
Whisper the sweetest words
And if you're ever sad
I'll make you laugh
I'll chase the hurt
My heart is set on you
I don't want no one else
And if you don't want me
I guess i'll be all by myself
You might also like
Come on, come on
Into my arms
Come on, come on
Give in to me

I'll use my eyes to draw you in
Until i'm under your skin
I'll use my lips, i'll use my arms
Come on, come on, come on
Give in to me

Give in to me
Give in to
