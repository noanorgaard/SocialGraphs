When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
