I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever, woah
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better, woah
Woah
(I can't stop—)
Woah

Darlin', tell me what more can I do?
Don't you know that I was meant for you?
You say I feel like heaven on earth
But you'd never know what heaven was if it wasn't for her

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever, woah
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better, woah
Woah
(I can't stop—)
Woah
I can't stop drinking about you (Drinking about you, numb the pain)
And I can't stop drinking about you (Drinking about you, without you, I ain't the same)
