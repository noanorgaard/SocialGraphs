Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth for dreams come to those
Who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Be more than words
Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind
To those who come to you

Belief is wet and ghost
Yet, loves the most of what we do

Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Those winter days
Those winter nights
Those days and those nights
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Challenge you, challenge you
Challenge 

As it breaks
The summer will wake
But the winter will wash what is left of the taste
As it breaks
The summer will warm
But the winter will crave what has gone
Will crave what has all gone away

People change
But you know some people never do
You know when people change
They gain a peace, but they lose one too
'Cause I've been hanging on you, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been weighing on you
'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been hanging on you
