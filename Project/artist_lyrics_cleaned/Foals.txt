'Cause I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not pulling me down

So people of the city
I don't need your counsel now
And I don't need your good advice
'Cause you don't have my lover's touch

You don't have my number
But we don't need each other now
The creed or the culture
We can move beyond it now

Now the wolf is knocking at my door
Bang-bang, it asks for more
Stand here, we stand tall
We can move beyond these walls
You might also like
And I don't need your counsel
And I don't need these city streets
And I don't need that good advice
'Cause we can move beyond it now

You don't have my number
We don't need each other now
The creed or the culture
You don't have my lover's touch

'Cause I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel, well, I feel alive
I feel the streets are not far from here
Can you even hear me?
Do you even know my name?
Can you see the ocean there?
You don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number
You don't have my number
I wonder, can you hear me?
And are you even listening now?
'Cause you don't have my number
And we don't need each other now
And you can't steal my thunder
'Cause you don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number
And I don't need no one now
And I don't need these city streets
The creed or the culture now

Now


I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
I see a fire out by the lake
I'll drive my car without the brakes

I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes

Oh, gimme some time
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
Yeah, when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go

I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
And my desire wears a dark dress
Ah, each day I see you less
You might also like
Oh, gimme some time
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
Yeah, when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go

Through lanes and stone rows
Black granite, wind blows
Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again
Dark clouds gather 'round
Will I run or stand my ground?

Oh, when I come to climb
Show me the mountain so far behind
Yeah, it's farther away
Its shadow gets smaller day after day


Yeah, gimme my lungs
Gimme my love
Gimme my choice
You keep me coming around
Will I stay?
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my voice
You keep me coming around
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, come on
Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way
Will I stay?
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my choice
You keep me coming '
