I thought I was just the guy for you, and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
Love or not, I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine, one less is nine; get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend

I just hope you're happy
Stringing me along
While you're stringing, I'm here singing
This, my saddest song
I wish I could see you
I wish I could sleep
Should I freak out? Should I seek out
Someone I could keep?

I walked around a lot
Wishing you were here to keep me from sleeping
With anyone who might
Want me, or even not
Some guys have a beer and they'll do anything, anything
Anything
