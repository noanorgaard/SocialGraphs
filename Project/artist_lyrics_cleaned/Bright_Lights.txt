Oh-oh, oh-oh

I did everything, I prayed for you, yeah
I even stayed with you when your ship went down
Only thing I wanted was for you to do the same
Just hold me but it's too late now

'Cause we could've been lovers, could've been friends
Could've been with you right down to the end
But you're a runaway
Saving my love for a rainy day
I said we could've been lovers, could've been friends
Could've been with you right down to the end
But you're a runaway
Saving my love for a rainy day
I said we

I did everything I could, did more than I really should
I was giving you my all
Now you wanna hunt me down, asked me why I'm not around
You know that it's not my fault

I could've stayed with you, you, you, you
I would've stayed with you, you, you (Oh-oh)
I could've stayed with you, you, you, you
I would've stayed with you, you, you (Oh-oh)

We could've been lovers, could've been friends
Could've been with you right down to the end
But you're a runaway
Saving my love for a rainy day
I said we could've been lovers, could've been friends
Could've been with you right down to the end
But you're a runaway
Saving my love for a rainy day
I said we
