Toast to the Ghost
That Ebeneezer never seen
Loke with hypnosis
Hope shit that they feed us
Let us bring more
Puff high swing low
Keep our motives peace devoted
Touch skies 
Freedom open, we decoded
Negro voted chief
I'm suppose to hold angles
Ask Mr. Bojangos
Nigga savage taking shots
From both angles
It's Ghost Life
Until that tag on that toe dangles
Coast strangles foes
That's high bones just a low gang
On the sickest out here
Put the dick in y'all ear
Starting to see a lack
Of fuckin', real niggas out here
High off that emblem
On the timberland
Down in the pin
Nigga thats KnoX
Tremble step in the heaviness
That rippling up that black top
Tell them Shel
The will of hell
Will wel-come
Hella will come
Wella hell
Fella will
De-di-kill
Two out of three-fifths
The sixth sense
And seven seal
Imagine the red deville
Sway-Elven got a better feel
KnoX not novice nah
Top spot is not enough
Vocative
I draw the hottest chicks
And the wildest dawgs
Excuse me last line
Got that dot dot
Out of law that top lock
Your bottom jaw
And drop lots
On how to rob
Hipster rappers are tripster trappers
Shit for Shady and tit for tatters
Whose nitch is inconsistent
Flip the script and see
If that shit matters
Get the savage
Mix with the image
Blasting of Maclom in the window
Out comes suspense for
Out comes the pencil
Can't outrun them in-lines
So out comes your insides
The outlaw that’s inclined
You out off them mid-line
Mouthing off about being fly
I pop it off and I'll be inside
With a crock gun dee
Nigga all one knee
You can count on me
Till the block run free
Fuck around
And I'll come around
With Scott, Ill, and them
With a look on their eye
Ain't shook to die
You can try mother fucker
I'll kill for him
I'll mill them
I built with them
I skill with them
And I heal with them
Soon the money and hoes
And all the sunny roads are gone
These mother fuckers
Still with him
You might also like
Impeccable Intellectual
Rez Electric Music
Flick snakes and fakes
I will be executing
It's Baby Shel
On the microphone
Spitting stupid
The dirt wicked with it
Spit a wicked rhyme
Proven
Up north Minnesota
Hold it down
Properly
Ain't nobody stopping me
Triple R gang insane
You cannot stop my team
I slip lean feel supreme
On my Charlie Sheen
Shit when I get between
Money and Liquor
And various drugs
This the Rez life hoe
There ain't no comparing to us
Poverty up in the woods
With the scariest thugs
Who tote automatically choppers
And don't give a fuck
So what
Impeccable, Intellectual
Rap professional
So learn a lesson hoe
You don't want beef
Cause I turn you
Into vegetables
With a rhyme no cosign
I could get extra cold
Extraterrestrial
Raps out of the universe
Imma swallow your soul
But not before I chew it first
Wake up bake up
Music on my mind hoe
Shake up greater
Proven how that grind go
Bar because I'm hardly
Not even trying though
Rhymes climb over bullshit
Its like its flying so
High up a rhyme up
That does not hesitate
If you bring a beat
I kill that shit and
Then attend the wake
Earthquake rappers
In the worst way
With the wordplay
I smash after over
Obstacles observe great
Mist pouring out my mouth
In the form of words
Releasing stress with the loud
I enjoy the herb
I'm sure y'all heard
How my rhyme skills
Destroy the verbs
Common nouns profound
With sound I'm absurd
Unordinary apparently
More than scary
Preparing me for more clarity
On snakes and poor comparisons
From different rappers
That I'm better than
I be ending them
I beat them all
With just me
And it was like ten of them
Powerful
Writing rhymes every fuckin' time
That an hour go
By on the clock I jot lines
Just to reminisce and piss off
Wack rap dudes
Who will be permanently fucked
Like a wack tattoo
That shit back at you
No manners when I spatter
Lyrics fast at dudes
When I say I pack twos
It's remarkable raps
I bark you collapse
Backwards breaking your back fast
With a backlash after
Spaz out
Till the Rappers act out
Side the box
When I rhyme it's silence
Then the heads gonna bob
Then they're wilding
When I'm rocking
On the stage I knock
Mother fuckers on their back piece
I'm behind the wheel
You in the backseat
But you bout to be
In the trunk though
For dissing me up on my rap sheet
That's the shit I don't like
When you run your mouth
Like an athlete if you ask me
It's the fingers doing the talking
Swear to get your ass beat
If you're hearing me
Keep up with the fast speed
That I kick with
When I get a fast beat
With the wicked shit
Spit it up nasty
When I get a bit
I get them off
A and heat
Withstand heat
Cause he spit flame
Slap a rapper like I'm Rick James
Baby Shel get them all sickly
Barz hard I display
On the microphone
You a mother fuckin' hater
If you don't like this
