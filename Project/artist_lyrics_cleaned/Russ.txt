Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessin'
Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it (yeah)
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be layin' wide awake up in my thoughts at night like
"Goddamn, motherfucker, this worked"
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a new crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep 

Mama I been working, tryna get this money
Tell Dad please don't worry, no one's going hungry
But I know this ship just keeps on sinking
Gotta' just keep on swimming

Hold on, I'm, coming to the rescue, rescue
You know I'm coming with some vests too, vests too
Everyone's suffocating, I've had enough of waiting
I'm tryna' save us all from drowning

My parents in shambles
Cause lack of financials
They been late on car notes
Every dollar borrowed
They been back and forth, yeah
Leaving is an option
Debt's at the door, yeah
And it keeps on knocking
IRS is watching
Mama tryna get safe
Dad is being prideful
I'm just tryna get paid
Could have a signed a deal, yeah, but it wasn't worth it
Am I being selfish for knowing what my worth is?

Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

Yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they wanna be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talkin' while chewin' my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happenin'
Girl in San Fran. who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passin' it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move

Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

Movin' to the rhythm
Of my intuition
Anything I want I
Speak into existence
That's how I'm living
That's how I'm winning

Five bands a show now
And you know it's going up
Plays in the millions
Guess I'm finally blowing up
Oh what a feeling
Ten years makin' beats
Patience taste bitter
But that after taste is so sweet
Could've stopped at anytime
Wouldn't have believed this
People used to talk down
But now I got 'em speechless
That's what I call foresight
That's what I call manifest

I don't wanna hear about these rappers with the same flows

Excommunication from the game, now they rewarding it
Got me so glad I know myself

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, "Ho" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Showed you what it is you disagreed
Back the fuck up
Take a shot, hit some weed
I know you cried about being alone
Thats why I tried to take your lost ass home
But you were busy pointing fingers
At everybody but you
It started as love then we gotta little drunk
And it turned into fuck you
Now Im bout to ride
Swervin back and forth
Inbetween acceptance and this ain't what I asked for

In between high, in between drunk
In between love and I don't give a fuck
In between high, in between drunk
In between love and I don't give a fuck

I had a vision and I still have it
You had a difference in belief and bad habits

Y'all gon' have to do better, I can't believe what I'm seein'
All this bullshit goin' on, the industry is deceivin'
All the masses pitchin' rappers as these independent grinds
Meanwhile, there's been a label right behind 'em the whole time
Fake shit, call it out, you were plugged before your first song
I was puttin' in work, you were gettin' worked on
Your fans are fickle 'cause your come-up is a mystery
My fans gon' stick with me 'cause me and them got history
Longer than two songs, you don't know how to build
You tried to start at the roof, ah, you won't be here for too long
I don't fuck with crews unless you're the one who put the crew on
The rest of y'all got buzz because he put you on a few songs
Ooh, uh, did that strike a nerve?
If the shoe fits, then wear it
Either way, I know the truth, I'ma share it
See, these rappers sign deals, labels know what they're doin'
They tell the rapper, "Don't announce it so the people keep rootin'"

Try to keep me on the hush, but I do not give a fuck
This is Russ uncut, I'll expose you
You ain't really seen shit, just wait 'til I'm on
Then it's on, got a lot I gotta show you
Why you gotta lie? Yeah
I'll bring it to the light, yeah

I got a gripe with the media, all of y'all are wannabes
Producers and rappers down for sodomy
Dick taking 'cause the industry tells you to
It's fucked up, I had a standard that I held you to
I'll name names if you provoke me, so shut your fuckin' mouth
My platform is way bigger than the ones that turned me down
Bunch of grown men and women
Talkin' 'bout grown men and women for a livin'
Man, you gotta be kiddin'
Call me bitter, call me jealous, call me this, call me that
This is ten years grindin', what the fuck you call that?
Made the beats, wrote the songs, sang the hooks, and I mixed it
Everybody's got a switch and y'all just flipped it

You're an industry artist, I'm an artist in the industry
Me, myself, and I, that's the holy fuckin' trinity
I partnered with Columbia, "partnered" is the keyword
We split the profits fifty-fifty, better do your research
Came in with my own fan base
Sold out tours around the world before the handshakes
You see, I play the game well, you let the game play you
You don't know your own power, you think the label saved you
Now subconsciously, you owe them, you're submissive with your actions
Then you flop, flop, flop, and you wonder what happened
Couple things, you dropped one song and signed a deal
You have less than ten songs out, you're not real
So the song became bigger than the artist
People know the song, but they don't know the artist
Not enough songs to become their favorite artist
Not enough songs to be a headline artist
I could do a week-long set if I performed my whole catalogue
Every single song, the crowds sing and rap along
Fuck a summer, I'm a decade rapper
You're here now, I'll be here a decade after
I put out eleven albums produced by Russ
Mixed, mastered, engineered, written by Russ
