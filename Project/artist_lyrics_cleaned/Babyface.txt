But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?

And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...

When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?

Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
