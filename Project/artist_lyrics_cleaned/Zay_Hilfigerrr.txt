Walked in this party, and these girls lookin' at me
Skinny jeans on, and you know my hair nappy
Hey, hey, hey, hey, okay, okay
I want y'all do it, do this dance now

JuJu on the beat, JuJu on that beat
JuJu on that— JuJu on that— JuJu on that beat
Now slide, drop, hit dem folks, don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy, don't stop, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
You ugly, you your daddy's son
You might also like
Ayy, ayy, do your dance, ayy
Go crazy, ayy, get freaky, ayy
Let's go, leggo, leggo, leggo, leggo
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Okay, we knuckin' and buckin' and ready to fight
I got my cousin, he with me, and got Lil Zay on the right
And I'm a Detroit baby, and I don't know nothing else
Besides drinking and having parties, and having some fun
I say look in the mirror, what you expect me to do?
I see a 300-S, and got them blacked out rims
I mean, I like your style, I'm on a whole 'nother level
If you compare me and you, there wouldn't be no comparings

JuJu on the beat, JuJu on that beat
JuJu on that— JuJu on that—, JuJu on that beat
Now slide, drop, hit dem folks, don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy, don't stop, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
You ugly, you your daddy's
