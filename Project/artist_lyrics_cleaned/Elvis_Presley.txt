Baby, close your eyes and listen to the music
Drift through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night, and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease

Hey, a little less conversation, a little more action, please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite, a little less bark (Ahh)
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me (Satisfy me)
Satisfy me, baby (Satisfy me)

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin' (Yes, I'm cryin')

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm, yeah, yeah

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help
Falling in love with you?

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
