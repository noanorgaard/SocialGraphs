You said, "It's all yours if you take it there"
I said, "I can't do it alone, I swear"
You said, "It's all yours
It's all yours when you smile"

It's only you (You)
Loves me like you do (Do)
Trying to keep it cool (Cool)

Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof)
I'm trying to keep it cool (Cool)
But I can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)

Can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)

Before you, love, I was lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one that rescued me

We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be


Anybody's got the power
They don't see it 'cause they don't understand
Spinnin' 'round and 'round for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands
