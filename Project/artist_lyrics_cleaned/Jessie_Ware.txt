Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own

Won't dance, not without you
Small steps, they lead only to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
What's wrong, you cannot lose
My eyes only see to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark

Always on a mission like a—
Always on a mission like a warhead

But I'm still dancing on my own

I know you hear me
But can you reach me?
Feel free to touch me
And we can play hard
With bodies jerking
But still I'm working
I'm new to moving
And we can play hard

Now if you're never gonna move, oh my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you, oh my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm

Still dancing on my own
We can play hard
Hard, hard
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard, hard, hard
Hard, hard

Can we find a way to bring you back again?

But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Don’t keep me with the kisses
There’s never any there when I need
It’s just that you can always make me feel
Like I am slipping in way too deep
And let the shadows hope to hide
Or break the dreaming, dreaming of us
And if I keep slipping in, just keep up with the talking
Know that I’m with you, I’m not about to go

But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no

No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're feeling small
Alone in the night you whisper
Thinking no one can hear you at all
You wake with the morning sunlight
To find fortune that is smiling on you

Don't let your heart be filled with sorrow
For all you know, tomorrow
The dream that you wish will come true

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love, if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
I want to feel burning flames when you say my name
I want to feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

Won't you stay? Won't you stay?
Slowly, slowly you unfold me
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know
