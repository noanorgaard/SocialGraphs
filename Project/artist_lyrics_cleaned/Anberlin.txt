A little bit closer to finding the real you
A little bit closer to finding the truth
Stranger things have happened
Stronger men have answered
A little bit closer to loving you

Is it alright if I call you lover even though we don't know each other
And probably never will
Would you stay with me, here in my dreams?
If I promised you this heaven
Would you take a chance on a make believe dance?
Close my eyes and we're together

Prayers that need no answer now
'Cause I'm tired of who I am
You were my greatest mistake
I fell in love with your sin
Your littlest sin

Failure is your disease
You want my outline drawn
You were my greatest failure

Godspeed to all you're after
