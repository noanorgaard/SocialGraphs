You know what I'm talking about baby, yeah
Now it's time for you to show me what it's hitting for
Sip a little jack, maybe blow a little dro
Love you from behind, but I hate to see you go

Ooh-oh
Come on give me that green light
You can let your hair hang down
Well only if it feels right
Oho, give me that green light
I need you, to give me that green light

With your permission
I just wanna put a little smile on you
With your permission
There's a whole lot of motherfuckin' lovin' that's way past due
I owe you
With your permission
I'ma do all the things that I said I'm gonna do
