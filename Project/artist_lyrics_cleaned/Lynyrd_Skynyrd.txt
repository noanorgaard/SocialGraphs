Oh, take your time, don't live too fast

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away?
Now I feel the wind blow outside my door
It means I'm, I'm leavin' my woman at home
Lord and

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind again

And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'
I just want to be left alone

Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinking the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm going to lose my mind

So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye, that's right

Well, "What's your favorite color?" and "Do you dig the Brothers?" is driving me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just wasting time

So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the Southland
I miss ol' 'Bamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

In Birmingham, they loved the governor
Boo, boo, boo

Does your conscience bother you?

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes, they do)

They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure"

Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
