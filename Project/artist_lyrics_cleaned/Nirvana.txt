Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July

I don't need no million dollar jet
Just to prove to millions that I'm fly
I don't need no fucking Corvette
Go in debt tryna prove you got drive, (You don't)
See what you got on
Is a form of living beyond your means
Bitches might give these actors super dome
They might keep their lights out like New Orleans
But that don't mean that you spit raw
That don't mean you compete
My rebels never reside in the street
Hardly get Z's, cause you might die when sleep
So back off me
Unless you brought a cup with some black coffee
Wake my ass up and I blast off B
Been 2010 since some last saw me
And I was raw then, so what you think now?
Turned 22, hardly got a drink in
Cause I'm always thinking 'bout my sound
My back hold my town
So my act always wild
We never fuck the party up
We too fucked down
Right?
