1 ContributorTears in Your Eyes LyricsI've done my best
It's not enough
Sometimes I feel like I just can't catch up
When all I've done is wrong to you
I've given up
I've let you down
Over and over you have stood your ground
You care for me, I don't know why

I've caused those tears in your eyes
I've caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart
The sun was down
I hide my eyes
I've broken your heart now too many times
And all I can do is just ask why
My head in my hand
You're at the door
Why am I so foolish like I've been before
I push away, I don't know why

I've caused those tears in your eyes
I've caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart

I know we'll both make it through
I know we'll do what it takes
I know the sun will come up
There's a break in the clouds
Let's wash those tears all away

And we both stood there
Your hand in my hand
I looked at you, you looked at me
We made our promises there
Our friends and family
Will always be there
I know the best is yet to come
I know this will take some time
The joy in your eyes
Was never ceasing
I knew you'd be there 'till the end
I caused those tears in your eyes
I caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart

I know we'll both make it through
I know we'll do what it takes
I know the sun will come up
There's a break in the clouds
Let's wash those tears all away

I'm turning around
I know we'll both be OK
The sun's coming out
Let's wash those tears all 

I am your cover
And you are mine
Yeah we've got each other

Come rain
Come shine
I am yours and you are mine
In death
In life
Yeah we are all in this together isn't that right?
Come rain, come shine

We break what's not broken
Close what is open
Cause somebody said so
We fall in line
We take what's not stolen
We fake what we're feeling
We beg for what's already ours

I saw you dancing with your Sunday dress on
Left nothing to imagination
Offering to buy me a glass, so why would I decline?

So go 'head baby I'm a modern man
And I don't care what you bring to me
Yeah, don't you know you're not a part of my plan
I can't expect you to understand
Find someone else you can be

This is the reason I bought you a frame, girl
You're having trouble with your family name
Somewhere on the journey long ago you lost your place

I read the headline for the morning paper
Couldn't remember what your name was
Asked the television for all your information

I never liked the implication
Drowning in the ocean of your lowered expectations

Where I belong
What I believe
I been looking for something, oh no, to carry me
If I find what it is I need
Maybe all this wandering round and around, it will finally

Stop my heart
Stop my mind
Stop the long loss of time
So shut me up
Shut me down
No more picking sides
So I can't recall

1 ContributorDon’t Lose Your Love Lyrics
Every time I look at you I fall in love all over again
And you're the reason I do what I do
I hope someday you can appreciate that

Don't ever lose your innocence
Don't you lose that heart
Don't you lose your confidence
Oh, but most of all
Don't lose your love

I can see the mysteries of God behind your beautiful brown eyes
A wonderful expression of what happens when two people fall in love
Right before our very eyes

Don't you lose your attitude
Don't ever lose that smile
Don't you lose your tenderness
Oh, but most of all
Don't lose your love
Love

Well Henry is my baby boy and everyone he meets he gives a wave and a smile
And somewhere long ago I lost the light that's only found within the heart
Of a child

Don't you lose your humility
No man is bigger than the next
Do what you love and the money will come
Oh, but most of all
Don't lose your love
Don't ever lose your sanity
Don't you lose your mind
I've seen it all and I sure don't know much
Oh, most of all
Don't lose your love
Love, love, 
1 ContributorIt’s All Just Pretend LyricsIf you cry, make sure that they can't hear,
And if you laugh, draw your enemies near,
And if you find yourself somewhere between doubt and belief,
Remember, remember to think on your knees.
Never trust that man who's been smiling all his life,
His fears will catch up in the end,
He's standing tall while the rest of us are blind,
Oh brother, it's all just pretend, it's all just pretend.
And if you run, run so nobody can catch up,
And if you drink, you better see the bottom of that cup,
And if you lose your mind, make sure your friends can get it back,
And can you find, all the beauty and the pain that we had,
And all we've been doing is painting our faces,
Taking our lives to the brink,
Drowning our thoughts with our weak information,
Wishing we had something more to give,
Never trust that man who's been smiling all his life,
His fears will catch up in the end,
He's standing tall while the rest of us are blind,
Oh brother, it's all just pretend,
It's all just the things that we wished for when we planned our lives,
But it's been hard to live, and it's been hard to die,
We've seen seperation from what once was clear,
Believe in ourselves, there was nothing to fear.
Never trust that man who's been smiling all his life,
His fears will catch up in the end,
He's standing tall while the rest of us are blind,
Oh brother, it's all just pretend
Oh brother, it's all just pretend
Oh brother, it's all just pretend, it's all just
