Made a track for the Spanish​ movie “Tengo ganas de ti”
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
Overcast by your shadow
As our worlds move on
In this shirt, I can be you
To be near you for a while
In this shirt, I can be you
To be near you for a while

There's a crane knocking down
All these things that we were
I awake in the night
To hear the engines purr
There's a pain, it does ripple
Through my frame, makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shame, it's the pride

Of you and me, ever changing
Moving on now, moving fast
And this touch must be wanted
Must become through your ask
But I need, Jake, to tell you
That I love you, it never ends
And I've bled everyday now
For a year, for a year
You might also like
I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names, there together
Must've fallen like a seed
To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind, I can hear you
Call my name, held the sounds
I am lost

I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
Now our rainbow is gone
I am lost, I am lost
I am lost, I am lost
I am
