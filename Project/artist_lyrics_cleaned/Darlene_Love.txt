(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) Are ringin' in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

They're singing "Deck the Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watchin' them shine
(Christmas) You should be here with me
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) If there was a way
(Christmas) I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas) But it's Christmas day
