I USED TO WANNA BE IN LOVE
BUT THE FAIRYTALE FADED FAST
I USED TO WANNA BE IN LOVE
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT’S NOT REAL

ALL THAT I THINK ABOUT IS YOU LOVING ME, YEAH
ANYWAY YOU WANT ME BABY
ANYWAY YOU WANT ME I’M DOWN ASS FOR YOU

YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING
YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING
I’M DOWN ASS FOR YOU
IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG, I DON’T WANNA BE RIGHT
YOU GIVE ME
YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING I’M DOWN ASS FOR YOU

I WISH WE COULD BE IN LOVE CRUISE INTO THE SUNSET CHAMPAGNE POPPING
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD
I GOT YOU
I WISH YOU COULD FEEL MY LOVE
OH BABY NOTHING’S EVER GOOD ENOUGH BUT I WON’T GIVE UP ON US

ANYWAY YOU WANT ME I’M DOWN ASS FOR YOU

YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING
YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING

IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG, I DON’T WANNA BE RIGHT
YOU GIVE ME
YOU GIVE ME SUCH A GOOD FEELING I’M DOWN ASS FOR
