So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people, "You can call me Your Majesty"
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow ("Your mother—"), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy (There—)
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses (There—)
And he won't stop till he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo (There—)
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
You might also like

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly, the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop* like snot bubbles



Sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying
They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent
Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come
The villains
