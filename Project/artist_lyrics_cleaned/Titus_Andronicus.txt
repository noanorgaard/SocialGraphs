I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out

I don't chase after clocks or calendars
I bow down not to masters, gods, nor managers
Cause all the greatest artists, they were amateurs
Unembarrassed, dressed in only bandages
And I don't read rules or adhere to rituals
I'm an impatient underdog indivisible
And my challengers are talentless imbeciles
When my chalice is full, I am invincible
I don't listen to parents or priests or principals
Inconsiderate of little individuals
When they ration out their miniscule residuals
Shit by the fistful
As long as there's a law, I'll be a criminal
You might also like
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out

I turned it up to four and couldn't feel it
I turned it up to five, it wasn't real yet
Turning it up to six wouldn't reveal it
Seven was a secret
Eight was reaching
Nine was decent, but

I really liked it when it dimed out
I only really like it when it's dimed out
I like, "like it" like it dimed out
I like it, like it, like it, like it dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
Whatever's inside, let it climb out
That was his plan and it's mine
