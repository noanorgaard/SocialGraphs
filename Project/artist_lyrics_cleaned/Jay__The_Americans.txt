"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"

So we started to dance, in my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist, uh, just one little kiss, so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
"Vamos, José's on his way"
And I knew, yes, I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, ye-yeah

"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"

Then the music stopped, when I looked, the café was empty
Then I heard José say, "Man, you know you're in trouble plenty"
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window, I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to José, ye-yeah

"Come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long"

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
I still hear her say
Calling her
