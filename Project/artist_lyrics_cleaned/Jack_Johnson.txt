"Sure, I pulled the trigger, but it needed to be done
Because life's been killin' me ever since it begun
You can't blame me 'cause I'm too young"

"You can't blame me, sure, the killer was my son
But I didn't teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
It's the killin' on this TV screen
You can't blame me, it's those images he sees"
"Well, you can't blame me," says the media man
"Well, I wasn't the one who came up with the plan
And I just point my camera at what the people want to see
Man, it's a two way mirror and you can't blame me"

"You can't blame me," says the singer of the song
Or the maker of the movie which he based his life on
"It's only entertainment, and as anyone can see
It's smoke machines and makeup, man, you can't fool me"
