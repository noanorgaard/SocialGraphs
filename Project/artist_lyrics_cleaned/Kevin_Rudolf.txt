I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it
I used to dream about, the life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it
Ooh, I made it
I made it, yeah
I made it, I-I-I made it

Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight, yeah
But now on top I told you to let it rock (Rock)
The moneys fallin from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it
I used to dream about, the life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it
Ooh, I made it
I made it
Yeah, YMCMB, baby
I made it, I-I-I made it
Birdman, swagged out, 100

Rooftop, hella choppa burnin' smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, nigga, hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain, make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna

I look up to the sky (To the sky)
And now the world is mine (The world is mine)
I've known it all my life (All my life)

I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it
Ooh, I made it
I made it (I made it)
I made it, I-I-I made it
Yo, ay ay ay, listen
See I don't live for glamour
And I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me then
Now they callin' my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I don gon platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is fallin' down

I look up to the sky (Damn, man)
And now the world is mine (Mine)
I've known it all my life
(Oh oh oh, whoa oh oh)
I made it, I made it
I used to dream about, the life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
(Oh oh oh oh)
I made it, I made it
(I look up to the sky)
I made it
I made it (Made)
I made it, I-I-I made it
Came from the gutter, lookin' like my motha
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy, we gettin' money like we just found oil
Uh, and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bedrash
And I just tell 'em to loaf it when the bread pass
Starin' at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world if I change hands
Uh, it feel good to be here
Weezy in the buildin' got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

I look up to the sky (To the sky)
And now the world is mine (The world is mine)
I've known it all my life (All my life)
I made it, I made it
I used to dream about, the life I’m livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it
(I look up to the sky)
I made it
I made it (Made)
I made it, I-I-I made it

I made it
Made it, I made it
Yes I did, yes I did
Yes I did, yes I did

I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
You might also like
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Yeoaw!)

Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (Rock!)
And Pamela (Rock!) and Samantha (Rock!)
And Amanda and Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, "Bitch, what's up?"
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock
Just let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock

Let it rock
Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

And I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this
