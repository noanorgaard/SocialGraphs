It gets old when you talk to the sun
In a tongue understood by no one
Can it be that I hear what he's saying?
Is there a reason why I'm still awake?

And he says, "I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate." (Ooh)
And I say, "You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate." (Oh, oh, oh!)

I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in
Just give me (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Just give me something to believe in

Everyday when I speak to the moon
Pale as a ghost in the afternoon
Tragedy has a hold of my mind
But I can see the light between the lines

Hey! The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
'Round this town of steel

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
I've been looking for so long
In Amerika
Throw my hands in the air

Flash faded
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It's a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne
It's all it really is

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh
