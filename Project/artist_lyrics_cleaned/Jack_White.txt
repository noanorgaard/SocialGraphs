(Listen)
Two black gadgets in her hands, all she thinks about
No responsibility, no guilt or morals cloud her judgement
Smile on her face, she does what she damn well please
(Right)
And she don't care what kind of things people used to do
An' she don't care that what she does has an effect on you
She's got freedom in the 21st century


Cut off the bottoms of my feet (Cut off the bottoms of my feet)
Made me walk on salt (Made me walk on salt)
Take me down to the police (Take me down to the police)You might also 

She's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers, then I lick my fingers
Well, every morning, I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in, garbage out; she's gettin' what she wants

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
If I get busy, then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself, I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you

Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Driftin' away when I'm talkin' and laughin' as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home
Force-fed, forced meds 'til I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her, you'll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness

She doesn't know, but when she's gone, I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinkin' too, but why, where, and what for, and who?
And I'm solo rowin' on one side of the boat
Lookin' up, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of 

I'm in a parked car on a crowded street
And I see my love made complete
The thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

Love is clockworks and it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Blindness (blindness)

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me? Yeah
Oh, my love
Blindness

Yeah, a little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, it's a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense, yeah yeah

Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and nobody else to tell
Take the money, why don't you honey?
Blindness, yeah

Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it, I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
Wrap it all around me, now?
Oh, my love
Blindness
Love is blindness, mmm
Oh, I'm too numb to feel, yeah
Blow out the candle
