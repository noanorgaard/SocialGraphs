I got a taste, got a taste
I don't know how, how much longer
I can wait, I can wait

Don't leave me low, don't leave me low

Don't **** me up, don't **** me up
Don't make me beg

Don't **** me up, don't **** me up

Know you well, know you want
Everything for yourself, baby, give me some (give me some)
Yeah, won't you give me some? (give me some)
Yeah, use me once (once), use me twice (twice)
If you could, yeah, you would half a million times
But you never do me right, oh, yeah
