Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I-I-I'm hunting looking for a come-up
This is ... awesome

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
Call me maybe

I'd catch a grenade for ya'
Throw my hand on a blade for ya'

We can pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
And I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

'Cause I got a feeling, ooh-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night

She got them apple bottom jeans
The boots with the furs
The whole club was looking at her

Baby-girl what's your name?
Let me talk to yah
Let me buy you a drank
I'm T-Pain
You know me
Konvict Muzic, Nappy Boy, ooo, wee

Oh, where'd you go?
I miss you so
It seems like forever
Since you've been gone
You should let me love
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need

I'm here without you baby
You're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you

Remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama, rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
I’m sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like "so what I'm drunk"
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some

I tried so hard and got so far
In the end it doesn't even matter

I'm falling even more in love with you
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me baby
Say my
