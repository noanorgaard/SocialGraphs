All the young bitches wanna fuck a goldmine
Young Rambo, hunnid Glocks hanging on my shoulder, hey
What the fuck you fuck-niggas talking about?
You ain't talking real loud when the bosses around
Sacrifice you niggas, it's a offering now
All you rap niggas turnt up with marketing now?
'Til I run up in your house, it's a robbery now
Gimme that advance, nigga, devil gon' dance, nigga
Don't make me grab my chopper, you don't wanna see these hands, nigga
Put you in the desert under thirty feet sand, nigga
I'm the badman, run this motherfucking land, nigga
Plant a landmine, better watch where you stand
It G ma, hollows gonna fly, it's a homicide
Mamas gon' cry, sing a lullaby
It's about us, never 'bout I
It's about trust, never 'bout lies

I'm movin' onto bigger things
Big bank take little bank, bow to the lizard king
Took DMT by the DMZ, made peace as the middleman
Then I woke up with a .45, seein' everybody firin' at both sides
We can all dream; 'til then, we can all drink
Live in fear like Ichabod Crane
I be sick of y'all, fuck 'em all, they do the same thing, not me (Not me)
Not me, motherfuckers, top three, I cannot be explained
Got the homie Keith Ape with a briefcase and a .38
Looking for the nearest currency exchange
Low-key, man, I'm gone (I'm gone), took keys to the blonde
Put the D in your broad like "Ayy, ayy"
Couple G's from abroad, five peas in a pod
Learned to speak in the speech of the gods

잊지 마
Underwater squad
여전히 몸엔 camo
Orca ninjas go rambo

Bitch, I'm a zombie
너무 마신 싸구려 코데인
여전히 몸에는 검/흰 camo down, you know we going
Harder than a mother, motherfucking ape
난 욕죠에 누워 쇼핑해
그건 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프
키쓰 에이프, 잊지 마, Killer Whale
Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whales
수영해 수영해 수영해
우린 곧 돈으로 수영해
너넨 컴퓨터로 구경해
너네 삶까지 내가 주연해
그니까 잊지 마 내 이름, 절대로 잊지 마 내 팀을
잊지 마 절대 내 이름, 잊지 마 절대 내 팀을
한국에서 우릴 잊음 귀를 잃어
Lungs full of tar and my tongue out my mouth
Head out the window, yo' bitch see me out
She open her legs, let it talk like Meowth
It's crying: "Oh, Father, boy, please eat me out"
Ride with no tint, I don't hide from no phonk
Come catch these hands, don't confide in no pump
The way I came in is the way I go out
Born in the pussy, I'll die in the cunt
So 'fore you get any ideas and I stomp
A mudhole in your ass, 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
While the drums and bass go "Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum"
And a medley of virgins are humming my song
Exchanging of smoke, I reside in the lungs
Exchanging of fluids, reside on they tongues
Fe-fi-fo, encumbered but under none
Father be the one the fi'est phenomenon

Weed got me wasted
Walk up in this bitch like I'm Asian
Been a minute since I’ve been in Shibuya
Goddamn, it been a long vacation
Keith Ape in the cut like Fredo
I'm gon' be alright, better duck when you see his K blow
He gon' take your life (Bow-bow-bow-bow)
All of my ninjas with the nine
A$AP Mob we gon' rep everyday
