And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Where do you reside?
When you hide, how can I find you?
'Cause I wanna send you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it

You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same

Live like a pharaoh, sing like a sparrow anyway
Even if there is no land or love in sight
We bloom like roses, lead like Moses out and away
Through the bitter crowd to the daylight

Forever I will move
Like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction
I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender
And remember we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given I won't be scared to die

I don't come from Detroit
But her diesel motors pulled me
And I followed til I finally lost my way
And now I spend my days in search
Of a woman we call Purpose
And if I ever pass back through her town I'd stay

If I live the life I'm given I won't be scared to die

And my life is but a coin pulled from an empty pocket
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
Hope and fear go with it
And the moon and the sun go spinning
Like the numbers and the fruit before our eyes
Sometimes I hit
Sometimes it robs me blind

One foot in and one foot back
It don't pay to live like that
So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks
For never to return

Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in

When at first I learned to speak
I used all my words to fight
With him and her and you and me
Oh, but it's just a waste of time
It's such a waste of time

That woman she's got eyes that shine
Like a pair of stolen polished dimes
She asked to dance, I said, "It's fine"
I'll see you in the morning time

Your dreams the catch, the world the cage
The highway sets the traveler's stage
All exits look the same

We sat at Lake Junaluska
And cried over where we would wed
If it's this place or any other
It's not where I am…it's who I'm with

News came of a child
Born unto a world
Of people, demented and wild
I will be here for you…my love

What was our reason for fighting
Selfish and centered at best
I give up on trying
To understand why we were blessed

We'll spend the night at…St. Joseph'sSee The Avett Brothers LiveGet tickets as low as $89You might also 

No longer do we wonder if we're together
We're way past that
And I've already asked her

So in January we're gettin' married

She's talkin' to me with her voice
Down so low I barely hear her
But I know what she's sayin'
I understand because my heart and hers are the same

And in January we're gettin' married

And I was sick with heartache
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her
But we would both surrender
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down
Don't ever turn it down

I hope that I don't sound too insane when I say
There is darkness all around us
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin'

And in January we're gettin' married

No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in
She knows which birds are singin'
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin

And in January we're gettin' married
Come January let's get 

Well I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

We change a lot
And no one here can stop
That train before
It gets to where it's going
At all

So I guess it's kind of funny how
I loved you so way back when
You say I wouldn't know you now
Well I didn't even know you then

I heard about the company you're keeping
And from someone who didn't have much interest
In keeping us apart

And so I go out Friday night
And talk to anyone I can
If they can see me they can hear me
Run my mouth
I tell them all
I'd love to see you once again
Or maybe
Just run into you hanging out

You know I lie, so it comes as no surprise
When I admit that I don't really want to reunite

When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesn’t change by the man that’s elected
If you’re loved by someone, you’re never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it

There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I’ll scream til I die or the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

There’s a darkness upon you that’s flooded in light
And in the fine print they tell you what’s wrong and what’s right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And I’m frightened by those who don’t see it
