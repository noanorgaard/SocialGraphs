(Dickey-doo-oo-oo) (Locka-day-ay)
How the time flies
When I'm near you
When I'm near you
How the time flies
Seems like heaven
When I'm near you
When I'm near you
How the time flies
Wonder why when we're alone
The hours always pass so fast
A kiss or two, and then you're gone
Gee, the time just doesn't last
If the night would never pass
And the sun would never rise
Not one moment would we waste
But, darling, how the time - it flies
How the time flies
When I'm near you
When I'm near you
How the time flies
