(Ooh-ah) A little bit more
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
(Ooh-ah) A little bit more
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good, let's go all the way
It's got to be, set me free
But tonight, let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go
How can I prove my love to you?
Baby, please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
(Ooh-ah) A little bit more
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

What can you do for me?
Oh, what can you do?
'Cause I feel so alive
I feel your love inside, oh
