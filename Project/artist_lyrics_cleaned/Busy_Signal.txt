Unuh fi dweet
Man, unuh fi dweet
Lowe the young youths make dem run things a str-street
Unuh fi dweet
Man, unuh fi dweet
Lowe the young youths make dem run things a street

Some deejay need fi retire
Lowe the business, unuh time expire
I nah play no hypocrite, some man need fi quit
Dem career gone down to the wire
Likkle youth, hear this!
Me no Nintendo, nor Atari
Me no old like Fred and Barney
When mе touch the stage woman a grab me and a draw mе
How da young boy yah so corny?
Sing song and can't perform it?
When the stage show fi mash up, the whole world say dem want me
Ninja want me fi go tour
Follow Dora go explore
How long you a deejay, your throat can't sore?
Me want some of the forward and the encore
Want step up pon stage and hear mi fans roar
Dem ago tired fi see mi face, say no more
Me pay mi dues, like the toll weh fi go a Portmore
Long before Nitty Gritty and Pan Head skull bore
Me a the baddest deejay from me kick in the door
You might also like
Dem no badder than we
Come make we tell dem 'bout the music history
'Cause dem no know Daddy Royal, Edi Fitzroy, Supercat, all Colonel Josey
Ninjaman, anuh that youths a pree
The thing start a Killer and Beenie
Kartel, Mavado, Busy Signal, Aidonia, Konshens, Popcaan, Tommy Lee

Specialist, you no see mi style dem cris?
From you diss foundation you ago kick the bucket
Wha' dem a plan?
'Member the great Papa San?
That deh man lef' dance and go turn christian
But, you see me when you 'member General Trees
That deh man a dance, him create history
When me hot, 'member the great Supercat
Dem man deh tear down stadium flat
Ninja, records stop spin, cassette reload
Old things haffi done fi the new things come out
Like 90 minutes of football, your time's out
You say we can't run the place? Well, you soon find out
So

Unuh fi dweet
Man, unuh fi dweet
Lowe the young youths make dem run things a str-street
