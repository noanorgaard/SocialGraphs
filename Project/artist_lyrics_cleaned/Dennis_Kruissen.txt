And I guess it's just how it goes
And I hope I'm not alone
'Cause I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love
I guess I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in
I must be falling in love

What do you do when you can't be patient?
'Cause your mind and your heart can't keep that pace
Always happens when you least expect it
Takes you over and it knocks you on your face
And it gets deeper as you flip the pages
Same story but it's told in a different way
It's been a journey but you're glad you made it
Call it home and you pray that you're here to stay
You might also like
I guess it's just how it goes
And I hope I'm not alone
'Cause I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love
I guess I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling in
I must be falling in
