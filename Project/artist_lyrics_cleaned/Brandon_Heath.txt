All those people goin' somewhere
Why have I never cared?

Give me Your eyes for just one second
Give me Your eyes so I can see
Everything that I keep missin'
Give me Your love for humanity
Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted
The ones that are far beyond my reach
Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten
Give me Your eyes so I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Step out on a busy street
See a girl and our eyes meet
Does her best to smile at me
To hide what's underneath
There's a man just to her right
Black suit and a bright red tie
Too ashamed to tell his wife he's out of work
He's buying time

All those people goin' somewhere
Why have I never cared?

Give me Your eyes for just one second
Give me Your eyes so I can see
Everything that I keep missin'
Give me Your love for humanity
Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted
The ones that are far beyond my reach
Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten
Give me Your eyes so I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been here a million times
A couple of million eyes
Just move and pass me by
I swear I never thought that I was wrong
Well, I want a second glance
So, give me a second chance
To see the way you've seen the people all along

Give me Your eyes for just one second
Give me Your eyes so I can see
Everything that I keep missin'
Give me Your love for humanity
Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted
The ones that are far beyond my reach
Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten
Give me Your eyes so I can see
(Give me Your eyes) Give me your eyes for just one second
(Lord, give me Your eyes) Give me Your eyes so I can see
(Everything) Everything that I keep missin' (That I keep missin') (Keep missin')
(Give me Your heart) Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted
(For the broken-hearted)
The ones that are far beyond my reach
(Give me Your heart) Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten
(Lord, give me Your eyes) Give me Your eyes so I can see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
