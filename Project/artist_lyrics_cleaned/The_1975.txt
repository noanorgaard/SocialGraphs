I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh, baby, won't you come again?
She said, "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"

You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it

And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

And maybe you, change your mind

I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (Again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh

"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you?"

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home, she's begging you to stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I lost my head (Lost my head)

And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

I thought I’d met You once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be Your child if You insist
I mean if it was You that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I’m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this
