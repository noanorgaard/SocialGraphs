Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)

I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal

I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today, I say

Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips

Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank America with my son cashin' a check
So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was, "Yes" (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark) I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch
Crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (Brrring) we could talk
Conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off, thinking 'bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (What she say?)
She said, "I couldn't do without you", then I said

Yo, yo
The next day, I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends, they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, "Lil' Howard you weak"
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, "Yeah boo, I can't see me without you"
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Henn and we can get drunk
It's up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby, hop in, it's enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and there's nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry, be happy and smile
