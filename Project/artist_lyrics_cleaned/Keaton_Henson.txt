By all means, give me your lessons in my ways
But damn it, don't expect me to change
Mold me to the man that I should be
But don't consider that man to be free
And how am I expected to behave
Oh, when I'm alone with myself everyday

I never loved you enough, my love
And I'll never hold you close enough

Teach me how to love you like I wrote
And say it like I mean it when I don'tYou might also
