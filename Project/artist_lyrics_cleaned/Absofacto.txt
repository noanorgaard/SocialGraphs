I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

Can't find an exit
I wander in a maze alone
If I find you will you shock me?
Left, left and right, right
Pretty sure that I've been here before
And it isn't what I wanted

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
You might also like
Your voice like an angel
Been chainsmoking all month long
Like you're someone I believe in
Am I only a lab rat?
Someone you can test things on?
This isn't what I signed up for
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve,
