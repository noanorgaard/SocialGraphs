I done told you, boy, I'm a soldier, boy
I got no choice but to be a rider
I approach you, boy, with the toaster, boy
Hit you point blank range and fire
I ain't trying to hear shit, I'm supposed to be rich
Motherfuckers getting with my bread
Then I'm 'gon load my shit then cock my shit
Nigga trip, I'll go for your head

I'll have your nigga in an ambulance telling you hold on
The choir in your funeral singing you so long
The top shotta, that rock product, the block gotta
Then pop hollows then pop bottles, the whole spot up
The more paper the more strength, we gon' get it
The fo' fifth come with the amp, we ain't missin'
I'm back on my bullshit, a verse is a full clip
Catch you with your bitch, throw a song in your new whip

Nigga, it's G-Unit, fuck your clique
Like syphilis, bitch, you stuck with this
I'm a loyal nigga, die behind mine
Even if 50 drop me I still wouldn't sign
You done lost your mind, bumped your head
Try to stop my shine, but I got bread
And I ain't got time to hear what they said
When I catch them cowards I'mma bust their head

I done told you, boy, I'm a soldier, boy
I got no choice but to be a rider
I approach you, boy, with the toaster, boy

I'm coming out of Southside, you know I'm raw
Big-ass check, they show our score
I pull the dough out, and roll out, the cream Azure
The fo'-fo' out, I know 'bout the keys of war
I'm hot, five hundred degrees or more
My door block an M16 or more
I'm in the store copping shit you ain't seen before
Black card swipe, green galore
Yeah, I said these niggas stop talking then start worrying
The Feds keep coming, the money we burying
I'm in a mean loft, I'm in the cream Porsche
I let that thing off, I turn to Teen Wolf
I drive a spaceship, nigga, 2008 shit
Hermès kicks on, I stay in some ape shit
Niggas on some hate shit, they all get hit
Got the Russian AK, Haitian flag on the clip

I done told you, boy, I'm a soldier, boy
I got no choice but to be a rider
I approach you, boy, with the toaster, boy
Hit you point blank range and fire
I ain't trying to hear shit, I'm supposed to be rich
Motherfuckers getting with my bread
Then I'm 'gon load my shit then cock my shit
Nigga trip, I'll go for your 

After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out
I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute
Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these snakes
You see 'em back in the hood, it's 'cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon 'bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mýa
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, uh
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man
If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam
Get out of line and I'm lightin' yo' ass up
Semi-automatic's spray I tighten yo' ass up - what?
