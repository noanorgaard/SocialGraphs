Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling
Like it all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music, it's true, it's true
(Mic check, one two, two, two)


I can see my baby swinging, his Parliament's on fire and his
Hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing, "Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in
Love"

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
The silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
But you got the music, you got the music in you, and you, don't you?
You pull me closer, I pull away, I'm feeling hot and on fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much
Higher
Boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love
Hold me closer you say
Hush baby, hush

It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do
I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

Mmm

Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame

Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere

There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse

Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night

Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmerin', we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"

I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" (Yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, get, get it
"Elvis is the best, hell yes"
"Honey, put on that party dress"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest
Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying
But I'm praying for you

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been gettin' old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been tryin' too hard (I been tryin' too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my cunt too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
(Say you remember!)
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
