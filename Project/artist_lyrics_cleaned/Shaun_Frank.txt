Oh, don't look no deeper
Oh, can't get no clearer
Oh, just let it go
Cause you only hit up my phone when you hate being alone

No, there ain't no future
Ain't, ain't no future
Don't got love for you like I used to anymore
No, there ain't no future
Ain't, ain't no future
I don't fuck with you like I used to anymore

Shit's not personal
Lately, it's been feeling kind of mutual
We're crazy if we think it's more than sexual
'Cause I know you can feel this distance
I won't offer no resistance, oh
You might also like
Oh, don't look no deeper
Oh, can't get no clearer
Oh oh-oh, just let it go
Cause you only hit up my phone when you hate being alone

No, there ain't no future
Ain't, ain't no future
Don't got love for you like I used to anymore
No, there ain't no future
Ain't, ain't no future
I don't fuck with you like I used to anymore

No, there ain't no future
Ain't, ain't no future
Don't got love for you like I used to anymore
