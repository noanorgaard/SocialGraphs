Yea, recognize who you are
Recognize who the god
See the leap, jump the bar
All this is, no mirage
All this is, no facade
Sing, sing song in a sec’
Don’t get trapped in ya neck
Enemies up for your head
Vibrate higher, vibrate, vibrate no liar
Can’t kill me yet
All guns off, no bet
Bang, bang, shoot up the set
Gang, gang, rep who you at
Clap one, two in a jet
Leave one, two in a bitch
All these stress up in my head, still can’t get no fucking peace
North, South, East, West
Pushing pressure to the streets

Drop
These niggas don’t even see this shit
Drop, melanin drop
Seriously, just like  ten, you don’t know where to stop
More power
Drop, shit
You might also like
Hundreds, thousands
Wrong direction
Drop, shit, drop, shit
Ugh, nations, ages
Trapped in cages
Drop, shit, drop, stomp
This shit, right here
Ripped from pages
Drop, shit,
