Those magic changes my heart arranges
A melody that's never the same
A melody that's calling your name
It begs you, " Please, come back to me"
Please, return to me"
Don't go away again
Oh, make them play again
The music I wanna hear as once again
You whisper in my ear
Oh, my darling, oh

I'll be waiting by the radio
You'll come back to me someday, I know
Been so long seems since our last goodbye
But I'm singing as I cry
While the bass is sounding
While the drums are pounding
Beatings of my broken heart
Will rise the first place of the charts
Oh, my heart arranges
Oh, those magic changes, mmm
You might also like
Those magic changes (ooh) my heart arranges
A melody (la la) that's never the same (la la)
A melody (la la) that's calling your name
And begs you, " Please (please), come back to me" (la la la la)
Please, return to me" (la la la la)

I'll be waiting by the radio
You'll come back to me someday, I know
Been so long seems since our last goodbye
But I'm singing as I cry


While the bass is sounding
While the drums are pounding
Beatings of my broken heart
Will rise the first place of the charts
Oh, my heart arranges
Oh, those magic changes, woah woah
Woah woah, oh, yeah,
