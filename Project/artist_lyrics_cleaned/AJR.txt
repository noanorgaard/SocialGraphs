Recently he said that she said that we said that he said some shit about me

So we're caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking
We're caught up in problems
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking, ooh, ahh
Hold up, hold up, can we make it stop?
Hold up, hold up, but I'm so caught up in drama
Everybody's talking, everybody's talking now

When did all our problems get so small?
We break up with lovers and friends
Make love to the rumors instead
Maybe we're addicted to it all
The drama is dangerous
But it's so exciting to us

Does the grass look greener (Greener)
On my side of the speakers (Speakers)
I tried a couple weekends
But that green’s not for me
I thought I’d get clever
Make my lyrics come out better
But at 7/11’s where you would find me

Don’t wanna get paranoid
Just wanna be making noise
You want a hit, it’s your choice
But please enjoy the show

I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s ‘cause I’m the one on stage
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great
I didn’t smoke no grass today
But that’s because I love to play
So who am I to take away
What makes you feel this great

Last night at the concert (Concert)
The audience, it flickers (Flickers)
They’re lighting up like Christmas
Still, that green’s not for me
On corners people cursing
To legalize their burning
But that ain’t no concern of mine
I keep doing me

I’m not narcissistic
I’m just high off the music
And I don’t wanna miss it
But I wouldn’t stop you

You light up if you like it
And though I may not like it
You just keep doing you

You've never heard of me
Or the weird shit I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no
And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
'Cause I'm not famous, no

Paparazzi is at an all time low
Paparazzi, they don't care where I go

Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

You're feeling good, you're feeling right
Across the floor, and I'm already losing my mind
Baby girl, looking fine
Watch you playing and playing and playing these guys
Catch my stare, little smile
Tell me that you're ready and you're feeling the vibe
Someday I'll be so damn sublime
We'll arrive behind a hashtag sign

I won't forget you, but I may
Forget your name
My lady
I know what you're thinking
When the bass starts ringing
Can you tell me when you're stoked to start?
Are you ready for tonight, setting it on fire
And we'll dance until we're dumb in the dark
