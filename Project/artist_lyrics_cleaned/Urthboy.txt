Even your grandma and your grandad
Distant relatives you never knew you had
Never kept tabs
To their far-fetched friends either ends of the map
Whatever goes everybody knows that
To the party crowd, every week they turn it out
They work their fingers to the bone, they deserve it now
And when the big tune drops hear the floor shout
When we get the call out, we all out

According to the people
The people that resemble
Disciples of the temple
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell
We're all going to hell

We'll be joined by agnostic and atheists
And loopy cuckoo cults across the Earth's radius
The brightest of the bright will be
Coupled with the shadiest
Workaholics condemned to pens with the laziest
The passive and the ropable, no hoper and the
Forgettable and uh, the quotable
The centre of attention to barely audible
Not even any privileges for the laudable
What Ben Lee meant, with we're all in this together
On the high road to hell we're birds of a feather
Nothing can unite us like endeavours to the nether
Bureaucrats lobbying Lucifer with a letter
I swear that Satan will get sick of it quick
Leavin' the evilest of evil even thinking to quit
To the tune of Kenny G playin' saxophone licks
Thinking hell has really gone to shit

According to the people
The people that resemble
Disciples of the temple
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
The Gallagher brothers are hanging with the brothers Grimm
Church choir mingling with them that never sung a hymn
The pope and all the endlessly devoted under him
Fellas that lived to the fullest to them that died wondering
And all the underlings, up to the chief
Execs, the celibates that never had great sex
Are getting cosy with the X X X, the devil accepts all
Creatures great and small (yes he will take your call)
The booking agent, label rep manager
Professional promoters hard to pick from amateurs
They hard to pick from anarchists who're hard to pick
From lawyers that are lining up for damages (isn't it all fabulous!)
Whatever happened to happily ever after
Obama and Bin Laden, gathering clouds darken
It's not the way it was supposed to be
"don't stand so close to me"

Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
Everybody c'mon, we're all in the fold
There'll be a bright future for all
We're all going to hell (let's go-o, let's go-o, let's go-o)
