(No, I don't care... I mean, hey, I got Penny...)
There comes a time in every girl's life when she's really got to ask herself deep down inside
"Is she ready to be going steady?"
Don't faint dead away
But I honestly believe that one month should be enough
Well, first of all, let's say if I'm dating this one boy Johnny
And one day, Johnny asked me to be his steady girl...

There comes a time where she's got to ask herself
"Steady or not? I mean, do you really want to be Johnny's steady?"
Don't think that a woman could honestly believe that one month should be just about enough
Well, first of all, let's see if dating that one boy Johnny a few times...

Three important rules for breaking up:
- Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
- Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear-jerking scene
If you want to date other people, say so
- Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time
And haven't been too serious
There's still a feeling of rejection when someone says she
Prefers the company of others to your exclusive company
But if you're honest, and direct
And avoid making a flowery emotional speech
When you break the news, the boy will respect you for your frankness
And honestly, he'll appreciate the kind and
Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision
Unless he's a real jerk, or a cry baby, you'll remain friends!

Being attractive is the most important thing there is
If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond
You have to be as attractive as possible
Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean
Wash it at least every two weeks
Once every two weeks
And if you see Johnny Football Hero in the hall
Tell him he played a great game!
Tell him you liked his article in the newspaper!!

I propose, we support a one month limit on going steady
I think It would keep people more able to deal with weird situations
And get to know more people
I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny
Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit
He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating
And once you've dated someone else, you can date him again!
I'm sure he'll like it!
Everyone will appreciate it!
You're so novel! What a good idea!
You can keep your time to yourself!
You don't need date insurance!
You can go out with whoever you want to!!
Every boy! Every boy in the whole world could be yours
