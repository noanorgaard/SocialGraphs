And I'm bout dive in it, straight to bottom
'Cause there is no toppin' this, pop lock and drop
On your man if you coppin' it, baby
I fall for these tropical ladies
I know that she wavy, she naughty, she crazy, she got it
She got it all on me – the road is wide open
And callin', I flow like a Lambo
My boo's a Bugatti, I live like a movie

Hand in my hand, no letting go
On top of my game, yeah, on top of my game

From miles away – Hello felt kinda gay
Now goodbyes feel like a tidal wave
