Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

La-la-la, la-la-la-la

So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
A lionheart

His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same

Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart

And these fingertips will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes can only meet mine across a room
Filled with people that are less important than you

All 'cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love you

So I think it's best, we both forget before we dwell on it
The way you held me so tight
All through the night, till it was near morning

I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin

I know I'll wither so peel away the bark

Hold your horses now, we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now, we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran

Some had scars, and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

I find comfort in the sound and the shape of the heart
How it echoes through the chest from under the ground
As the hills turn into holes, I fill them with gold
Heavy stones fear no weather

And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you

And I paint your body black, I hide in your hair
And you're staring back at me like I wasn't there
As our bodies become stills, we welcome the fear

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
