("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")
("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")
("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")
("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")
("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")
("Word up, I get down") ("I say yes, yes, y'all")

C.L. is ropin' the flow like a calf in a rodeo
And solvin' crime like Hawaii Five-O
Healin' like a medicine man, any foe or fan
Who know I can by supply and demand
I supply a dope beat with educated lyrics
And dеmand that they be odd like Oscar and Fеlix
Seekin' to the root of the problem and solve 'em
With rhymes more meaner than the streets of Harlem
Like a breath of fresh air, absorb the rhyme I flair
Some say it ain't fair when they hear and compare
My rhymes to theirs, and um, here's a lump sum
You're tiny like a stew pea and small as a crumb
Movin' like a checker to be a double decker
Ayo, straight outta Mecca comes the midnight wrecka
You might also like

The mental master growin' in the mainstream
On top like whipped cream, rollin' like the A-Team
I get the call to brawl and tell it all, you're small
Take a Tylenol, you're headin' for a big fall
I'm not afraid of you, I'm crazy as Bellevue
Hard like a horseshoe — so what you wanna do?
I wear and tear, horrify and dare
Anyone to compare their rhyme to this here
I sizzle like a griddle and play like a fiddle
Those courtin' the little middle I solve like a riddle
When I dismiss this type of lyricist
Emphasize an emphasis and you wish
You can counteract, exact my rhymin' attack
And when you crack, rebuild and come back
But I don't think so, no, you got nothin' to show
Facin' me, your score is round like a Cheerio
So raise up 'fore you get squashed like a turnip
More hard like penitentiary bars, you little buttercup
Movin' like a checker to be a double decker
Ayo, straight outta Mecca comes the midnight wrecka

Yo, just when you thought that the coast was clear
I appear, now you're shakin' in your boots with fear
And I come at'cha like a bat outta hell
Who excel and dwell, so you might as well
Take a back seat to the matador
Lyrical connoisseur to pack the floor and ensure
Poise and perfection for rhymin' inspection
Section to section, vocal dialection
Participants a must when I discuss and plus
In God we trust — yeah, us
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth live and kickin'
Never take a lickin' but keep on tickin'
I unload and explode while you're still on the crossroad
I got the area sowed
Because I'm unique when I speak, reachin' the height of my peak
Every hour, seven days a week
You can't stop it, nor stop it so why don't you drop it?
Clean out your ears and listen to the prophet
Movin' like a checker, rhyme competitor, rap senator
Night cap of rap as the midnight wrecka
