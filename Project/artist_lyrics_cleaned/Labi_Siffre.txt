Oh-oh oh-oh, oh I'm a vulture
Oh woah, I'm a vulture

I'm so sad that you're on your own
And your heart is a shelter

Oh woah woah, I'm a vulture

That you've made it there much too late

Oh woah oh, I'm a vulture
Oh woah woah, I'm a vulture
Oh-oh

Vulture's got class, vulture's got style
Vulture can heal her, with a look or a smile
Vulture's in town, so you'd better beware
Married or single, i just don't care

Oh-oh woah, I'm a vulture
Oh woah woah, I'm a vulture
Uh oh uh oh
Woah

Yeah, I'm a
