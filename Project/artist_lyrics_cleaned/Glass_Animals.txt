He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool, but
My life turns in slow motion

Bye-bye, baby, blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killin' you
Screamin' at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But, I settle for a ghost

Where I was from, in NOLA
No one left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust
He's chasin' that pappy pipe dream

(Ooh, ooh)
I know you don't, but I—
I know you don't, but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone, but I—
That girl is gone, but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit, but maybe not
I feel so fuckin' numb
It hits my head, and I feel numb
My body's lookin' wrong
My body's lookin' wrong

Bye-bye, baby, blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killin' you

Babe, I'm not what you think

Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes

Woo, woo, 

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I’m a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Down by the shore, a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate 'em whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to
We took to hills into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I

Run to me and kiss my hands
I’m dead before I

Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

Right, my little Pooh Bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

Mind my wicked words and tipsy-topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told

Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you? How can I be nice?
Trippin' round the tree stumps in your summer smile

Your baby's fallen
You know I’m talking now
You know I'm dancing
You know I'm racing ’round
No, no you're so juiced
You said you'd kick the booze
You know I'll get bruised
You know I'm just a boy

Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby, don’t you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you

Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo

Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

"Wanna play cheat now?" says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold

I can't get a job, so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat, but I look fantastic

Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

Baby (woo), now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're movin' forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's intact and
In an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us (woo)
And lately, I can't take it

Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's gettin' blazed

But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say it's hopeless (woo)
And we ain't gonna make it
