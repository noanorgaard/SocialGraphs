You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start any fights?

Now wait a minute
Things don't look too familiar
And who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me?
Well, he's awful cute
But how'd I get his shirt on?
I had too much tequila last night

You might also like
All those little shooters
How I love to drink 'em down
Come on, bartender
Let's have another round
Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high
Tomorrow might be painful
But tonight we're gonna fly

Jose Cuervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Every time we get together
I sure have a good time
You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo
