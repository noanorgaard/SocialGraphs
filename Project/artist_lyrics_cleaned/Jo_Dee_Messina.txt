All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Allelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Sleep in heavenly peaceYou might also 

Boy, you sure look good there standin' in the doorway in the sunset light
Maybe I read you wrong thinkin' you could be my "Mr. Right"
I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line
Said you needed some time, just a little more time to make up your mind
Well, it's been long enough
Time is up

Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before
You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on Highway 4
Baby, what did you expect me to do?
Just sit around and wait on you?
Well, I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
And I know it sounds trite
I've seen the light

Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

I've lost the game, I guess
I did my best to win the part
Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart

Bye-bye, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back
You can count on that
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye, bye-bye

Bye-bye
Oh, baby
Oh
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, 

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We're gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's been tailing us

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

Ohh California, Carolina,
