If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em, don't mean you should join 'em

Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'

Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay

And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no
