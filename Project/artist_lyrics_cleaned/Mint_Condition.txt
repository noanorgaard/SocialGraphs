You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you've remained
And to her so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
The yearning inside

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside
You might also like
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still, here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

Here we are all alone
But somehow we've got to stay strong

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
'Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside
Yeah

Makes me wanna say oh
Just gotta say oh
She makes me wanna say oh
Just gotta say oh
But what kind of man would I be, oh I can't be unfaithful
Sorry 

Pretty brown eyes
You know I see you
It's a disguise the way you treat me (The way you treat me, pretty brown eyes)
You keep holding on
To your thoughts of rejection
If you're with me, you're secured
You keep telling me
That your time is always taken
But I keep seeing you out alone (Out alone, pretty brown eyes)

Waiting to be unleashed
