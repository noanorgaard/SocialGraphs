And I found myself inside a midnight daydream
Baby if you saw it then I know it may seem
Like I'm moving on
But every time I touch her every time I taste her kiss
I just feel your lips
I can't snap out of this
Midnight daydream
Like I'm still with you
Midnight daydream
Dammit girl I miss ya

She led me up the stairs and to her bedroom down the hall
Put her hands under my shirt and pinned me up against the wall
She kissed me on my neck and whispered like you used to do
She was slipping off her dress and I was slipping in to

A midnight daydream
Baby if you saw it then I know it may seem
Like I'm moving on
But every time I touch her every time I taste her kiss
I just feel your lips
I can't snap out of this
Midnight daydream
Like I'm still with you
Midnight daydream
Dammit girl I miss ya
You might also like
I watched her blue eyes turn to green
It was your hands all over me
Like you never broke my heart
Like nothing ever changed
Damn I almost called her by your name
By your name girl
Midnight daydream

Midnight daydream
Baby if you saw it then I know it may seem
Like I'm moving on
But every time I touch her every time I taste her kiss
I just feel your lips
I can't snap out of this
Midnight daydream
Like I'm still with you
Midnight daydream
Dammit girl I miss
