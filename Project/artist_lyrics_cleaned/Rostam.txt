Everyone of us has felt the lights go down
Everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound
Everyone of us has felt it on our own
Lo and behold you were here now you're gone
Lo and behold you were here now you're gone

Along the coast we could see time and space
And across the water it was all emptiness
But I held you close, my cheek pressed up against yours
And I could feel the hereafter out in front of us both
Along the coast we could see time and space
And across the water it was all emptiness
But I held you close, my cheek pressed up against yours
And we could feel the storm gathering in front of us both

Ohhhhhh

Lo and behold you were here now you're gone
Lo and behold you were here now you're 

And I lay inside a field
Beneath a cherry tree
And listen to the grass
And horses as they pass
And wake up in the light
Across the mountainside
And I sleep beside a fire
I built with burning tires

Sunlight on your eyelids
You were sleeping
Ah ah, ah ah ah
Sunlight on your back
You were dreaming
Ah ah, ah ah ah
