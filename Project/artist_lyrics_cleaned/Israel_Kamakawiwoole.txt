Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true, hoo, hoo, ooh-ooh-ooh

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me, oh
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh, why, oh, why can't I, I?

Oh, someday, I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like-a lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh, why can't I, I?
You might also like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ah-ah, eeh, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
