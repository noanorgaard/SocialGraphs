Didn’t know you had it then, love was lost but never dead
But you could never drop it, never fake it
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard to say
You hardly left this place
Something from the better days it lingers

So tell me how we lost ourselves wishing we were somewhere else
The more I'm choosing part of me, the less I'm living honestly
So honestly

I’ll take my chances
I'm done with the questions
I’ll just make my answers
The sun can’t help but shine his shadow dances
With or without your steps
I’ll take my chances, shadow dances

Another kid from west LA
Tried to run away
Broken down but fighting time to heal it
Waiting for your plane to land, back to where it all began
Maybe all the colors will have faded

So tell me how we lost ourselves wishing we were somewhere else
The more I'm choosing part of me, the less I'm living honestly
So honestly

I’ll take my chances
Done with questions
I’ll just make my answers
The sun can’t help but shine his shadow dances
With or without your steps
I’ll take my chances, shadow dances
Shadow dances
Shadow dances
Shadow
