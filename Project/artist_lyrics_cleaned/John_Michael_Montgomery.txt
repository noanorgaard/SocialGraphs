I swear, by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear, like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
'Til death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the wall
And when there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as time turns the page, my love won't age at all

And I said, "Hey, pretty lady, won't you gimme a sign?"
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your bidding and be at your beck and call
Yeah, I've never seen anyone looking so fine
Man, I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm going once, going twice
And I'm sold on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten, I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Well, the auctioneer was going 'bout a mile a minute
He was taking bids and calling them out loud
And I guess I was really getting in it
'Cause I just shouted out above the crowd

And I said, "Hey, pretty lady, won't you gimme a sign?"
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine

And I'm sold on the lady in the long black dress
Well, she won my heart, it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well, I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah, we found love on the auction block
And I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
And watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

Oh, baby, I love the way you love
