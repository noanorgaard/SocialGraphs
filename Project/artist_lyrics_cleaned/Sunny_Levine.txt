My credit cards go wild
Put a smile on your face
Turn the pressure down a while
If that don't wake my mind up
Then i don't know what shakes me
I don't know what breaks me out
If i'm on my way
Then i'm already there
Just wait for me to show up in some style
Why don't we just sign on the line
And watch our credit cards decline
Maybe get free for a while
You gone running thru my dreams
Come on, come on, take over me
You gone running through my dreams
Come on, come on, take over me
I should have just hopped on that plane
And run my arms to you babe
Put a little light on
To take off your clothes
I just hopped on that plane
You might also likeWithout my hows or whys
It made me get free for a while
You gone running through my dreams
Come on, come on, take over me
You gone running through my dreams
Come on, come on, take over me
I can't find the breaks
So there is nobody to slow this thing down
And I, I just lost my shakes
So i can be the one who's steady right now
You gone running thru my dreams
Come on, come on, take over me
You gone running through my dreams
Come on, come on, take over
