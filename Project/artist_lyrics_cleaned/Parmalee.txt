And she feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
And when she looks back, I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina

It's hard to understand the way I'm living
And I know she thinks I'm never coming home (Never coming home)
But I miss her pretty smile, and I'm coming back in a little while
But I'm a thousand miles away again

And she feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
And when she looks back, I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina

No matter how far I go, you know I can't stop thinking about her
And there's nothing like the way I feel
The way I feel when I'm beside her

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

And she feels like Carolina
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
And when she looks back, I'm behind her

Oh yeah, she's every bit of all that
Oh yeah, that girl is like a first class high dollar ticket
On the Chattanooga (choo-choo)
Can I get a (woo-woo, woo-woo)
Oh yeah, she kicks it like a rocket
Cutoffs clinging to her pocket
Talking 'bout a home run grand slamalamalama
Front to back jack picture perfect panorama
She's a super fine reason to rhyme

(Uh-huh)
We like a snapshot, a paparazzi camera
Before the break up, Blake and Miranda Lambert
She got them sho nuffs coming in runner up
Panama city, wet T-shirt, Miss Banana
(Boats, boats) motor-boating
Man it's a handful juggling all these emotions
