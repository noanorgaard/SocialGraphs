Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
And weep, little lion man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Or rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And wasted on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I...


Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble, little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck

You told me life was long, but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
Called to be around for those below

Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat, is that healing that you're hearing in my tune?
Wanting change, but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of a man who's built his life on love

You told me life was long, but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
Called to be around for those below

I'll be locked up and stored
In a lavender ward
'Cause my mind is just like hers
Just as broken, just as crippled, just as burned

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults

Broad-shouldered beasts fill the sky
Manhattan beats at the night
But you are wrapped up in wire
Curled up in fright
So I took you to the city for the night
To dance under dizzy silver lights
But for a moment you were wild
With abandon like a child, just a moment

But wasn't it you who said I was not free?
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace?
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all

And it's alright, take it out on me
And it's alright, take it out on me

And no one is trying to listen in
What to hear our doubts
Hear our whispered shouts, they don't care

I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh, babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone
With the twilight?
With the twilight

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't

And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone in the compromise of truth

We had it tonight
Why do you leave it open?
And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don't leave a love divine

And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
