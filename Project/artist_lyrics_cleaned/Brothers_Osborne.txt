Yeah, but one more call
It's the one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It's the one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's the one more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tearin' t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
I'm lyin' here, wishin' you could stay a little longer

So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don't bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I'm all alone, then I'm picking up the phone

Mmm-hmm, oh


I hope you find the storm that you were chasing
Hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
As they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
When I hear the sound of high tide thunder
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
Yeah, you made a man of me

How you been?
I'd love to hear 'bout how you've been
You're the only broken heart I've ever had
And love to have again

Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me rememberin' how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

Came out here to do a whole lot of nothing
And we're doing pretty good I think
The only one thing we need to worry about
Is filling up when the ice cubes clink

Dipping our toes in the water
I don't care if it gets any hotter
It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
Two parts love and a pinch of good weather
And top it all off with the sun
And mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm
Mix it with rum, mmm mmm mm-mm

Lucky folks go to the ocean
The lakes for the land-locked ones
We got a tarp and a truck bed
A kiddie pool, a slip and slide
Let that garden hose run

It's you, and me remembering how to have fun
Let's put our hearts together
