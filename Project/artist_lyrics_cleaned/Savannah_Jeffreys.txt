You’re calling me on my phone
It’s two in the morning
Boy, you just ain’t the type that a girl gon’ hit once or twice
Gonna sing you all my slow jams
So come put your arms around this good love you finally found
And teach me how to slow dance
Cause I’m running out of breath from moving too fast
I need you to put the brakes on

My hand fits in yours like key and lock
I’ll meet you after school at 3 o’clock

I know that you and I got something good, good
And when we kiss, I love it when you touch my face
And I hatе to see you go, but I love to watch you walk away

My hand fits in yours like key and lock
I’ll meet you aftеr school at 3 o’clock
You made me see that nobody knows me better
And I still can’t wrap my head around us being together
And it’s all I ever wanted
You can finally call me your girl
You might also like
And I’ll teach you how
How to love like I do
And you show me how to forgive like you

My hand fits in yours like key and lock
I’ll meet you after school at 3 o’clock
You made me see that nobody knows me better
And I still can’t wrap my head around us being together
And it’s all I ever wanted
It’s all I ever wanted
It’s all I ever wanted
You can finally call me your
