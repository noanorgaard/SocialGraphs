Unselfishly died on Calvary
Oh how you gave your life for me
Bruised, scorned, crowned your head with thorns
No greater love performed, for me
Nails in your hands, nails in your feet, pierced in your side could barely breath
Could have came down, yet you remain
Standing in awe of the price you paid
(Pre-Chorus)
I never knew of a love so true
You gave your life and still I hurt you
Lost so many times, crucified you again, but I repent
Forgive me for my sins
(Chorus)
You paid it all , up on the cross
You bled and died, cause I was lost
So here I am, surrendering all
Lord hear my cry, on my knees I fall
You paid it all , all , all 
You paid it all , all , all
You paid it all 
(Verse 2)
I realized I'm no good (oooooh), there's no money I can pay
In exchange for the blood, you shed, shed for my sins (shed for my sins, yeah)
So I surrender my heart, my life ,my all
As a living sacrifice Lord I give up everything that's not pleasing in your sight
So I can have everlasting life
You might also like(Pre-Chorus)
I never knew of a love so true
You gave your life and still I hurt you
Lost so many times, crucified you again, but I repent
Forgive me for my sins
(Chorus)
You paid it all , up on the cross
You bled and died, cause I was lost
So here I am, surrendering all
Lord hear my cry, on my knees I fall
You paid it all , all , you paid it all , you paid it all , all , all you paid it all 
(Bridge)
You gave up your image, you sacrifice, so that this ol' boy can have everlasting life
You gave up your glory, so I can have my story
And I want to tell you Lord (ohhohh)
You paid it all up on the cross, you bled and died (ooooh ohh ooh oooooooooooh)
(Chorus)
You paid it all , up on the cross
You bled and died, cause I was lost
So here I am, surrendering all
Lord hear my cry, on my knees I fall
You paid it all , all , all 
You paid it all , all , all
You paid it all 
You paid you paid you paid it
