The angels above me, they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone, so far from home and love
Oh, the angels, angels, please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord, please

I've been playing my guitar, laying underneath the stars for you
In the light of the moon, I'll be forever singing tunes for you
When the stars are aligned like the colors in your eyes, greens and blues
It's not when or whether, we'll always be together, it's true

And the angels above me, they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone, so far from home and love
Oh, the angels, angels, please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord, please

And sometimes, I feel like my heart's gonna burst at the seams
And sometimes, I think it's just love that we want or we need
And sometimes, I feel like I'm living too much in my dreams
And sometimes, oh Lord, let me be, let me be, oh
You might also like
Are you feeling like I'm feeling?
Searching for the meaning of it all
I spend all my days trying to make some sense of it all
The ocean and the seas and the windblown trees are changing
And your love for me is all I need to keep believing

The angels above me, they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone, so far from home and love
Oh, the angels, angels, please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord, please

Oh, please
Don't leave me
Don't leave
