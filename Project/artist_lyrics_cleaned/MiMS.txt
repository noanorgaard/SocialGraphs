I am like the Eagles, I am like the Beatles
If music is the heroin then I am like the needle
And you are Black Sabbath, too paranoid
On the dark side of the moon like Pink Floyd
If writing is a weapon, all my gun shoots is Led Zepplin
Sex Pistols’ll whip you, show respect like Otis Redding
Bring me back to life like Evanescence, you beggin’
Me? I cause hysteria, I am Def Leppard
My mind is Disturbed, you cannot dissect it
I deliver mayhem, the music is my method
I am Van Halen, eruption
Plus I got a healthy appetite for destruction, let’s go

Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

You find me at Linkin Park, with Motely Crue
You say you know the what, but you do not know The Who
Pay attention, you can miss it if you Blink 182
And me, I’m the one, just like I’m U2
Unforgettable fire, burning like The Wailers
My life’s a motion picture and this is just the trailer
My suits a perfect fit like it's tailored
Fuck her like an animal, I’d Nine Inch Nail her
That’s how I came into the game, and now she’s pregnant
So this is why I’m Red Hot, like the Chili Peppers
And this is why I rock, and this why I’m rollin’
Like a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

Some say I have Bad Brains, that im out of my mind now
So when I open The Doors in my head royalty Shine+down
And Motorhead spit in a mean way
Momma I kill a man like Queen say
Rush to the bank, it was a Journey that was never concerned of me
‘cause money make it a Green Day
Tecca Nina make it to the grip spot
They lookin at me waving a Slipknot
I get the trip and they go and call The Police and now there’s a Warrant for my arrest ‘cause I flipped out
When the show they wanna, hate me beat me, so I said kiss my AC/DC
That’s anus colon dookie chamber, so they tase me heat me
Now I’m a Quiet Riot in the pen, Heaven knows when I get out
There’s gonna be a hit out, watch me Avenged Sevenfold
It was all a dream, when I woke up I was torn, I dreamt sickness
No Stone Temple Pilot, giving me Korn or Limp Bizkit

This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say "Yeah, I paid a guap"
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply "Nobody got to die"
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)

I don't understand how can I have so many haters
Knowin I'm there father like my name is Darth Vader
I can get you hemmed up while I'm being tailored
Then I slide off to the side like a fader
Homey i'm the president, governor and mayor!
I control everything, like a dictator!
Get you biz marked up, turn you into vapors!
If you got a problem get you swallowed like a chaser!
Model on my arm no homey I don't have to pay-her
All I have to do is tell her where I wanna take-her
Catch us out in Italy, then we in Jamaica
Caught up in the rapture, like Anita Baker
When i roll up to you niggas like a skater!
Move if you wanna when you see that red laser!
No matter how you move and that infrared will chase ya!
Then i keep it movin, homey see you later! Mims!

I'm tryin to keep it cool, if you wanna, you can move, if you wanna
Tryin to have a little fun, maybe move a couple numbers but
When you movin numbers, all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind your back, in the breath they speakin under
Man I'm hot, like the sun, like the middle of the summer!!!
Strike down in a flash, nigga you can call me thunder!!!
Chicks call me phil drummond 'cause i give 'em different strokes!!!
Bahh, bahh, bahh, bahh, bahh, beat it up, like a drummer!!!
They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you goin get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, cause they see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I don't need no goons by me, if you want it come and try me!!!
We can do this broad day, in the middle of the lobby!!!
Niggas say that they the shit, when they barely just a potty!!!
When they problems turn to prolly and they prolly turns to sorry!!!
Tell 'em!!!
