A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud

So stay there

Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud

There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And it keeps us here

My ears, my eyes, my brain is slowly bustin'
Black smoke, red sky, the television's sayin'
Downhill, head-on, another crash is comin'
Downhill, head-on, another crash is comin', move

Or watch the murder of your way of life

It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Brakes on, brakes on, brakes on, brakes on, brakes on, there's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still, sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere,
