Hotel, chateau
Champagne, lights low
Ocean, Of bedsheets
Come close, swim next to me
Take off your dress and leave it by the door baby
Love it when your lace falls to the floor baby
I just need to see a little more baby

Oh, I got I got
What you want you want
Baby you can have it all
What you need you need
From me from me
Let me be your habit
I can take you way up to the sky maybe
I can make you feel a brand new high baby
Oh, never have to come down
You can always have it
Let me be your habit

Chocolates, moonlight
Shining in your eyes
Can’t get enough
Keep doing what you’re doing
Cause I wanna
Take your dress and leave it by the door baby
Peel off your lace and throw it on the floor baby
I just need to see a little more baby
You might also like
Oh, I got I got
What you want you want
Baby you can have it all
What you need you need
From me from me
Let me be your habit
I can take you way up to the sky maybe
I can make you feel a brand new high baby
Oh, never have to come down
You can always have it
Let me be your habit
I just wanna be your habit
Yeah

Take me in I’ll
Go down easy
Tastes like sugar
I’ll be your sweet addiction
If you want it, you can have it
Love to be your habit
Yeah

Oh, I got I got
What you want you want
Baby you can have it all
What you need you need
From me from me
Let me be your habit
I can take you way up to the sky maybe
I can make you feel a brand new high baby
Oh, never have to come down
You can always have it
Let me be your habit
I just wanna be your habit
I just wanna be your
