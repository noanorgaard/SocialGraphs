Everything is perfect
It's falling into place
I can't seem to wipe this smile off my face

Life's a happy song, when there's someone by my side to sing along

When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're three foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall

Everything is great
Everything is grand
I got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
Everything is perfect
It's falling into place
I can't seem to wipe this smile off my face
You might also like
Life smells like a rose
With someone to paint
And someone to pose
Life's a piece of cake
With someone to pedal
And someone to brake
Life is full of glee
With someone to saw
And someone to see
Life's a happy song, when there's someone by my side to sing along
I've got everything that I need right in front of me
Nothing's stopping me
Nothing that I can't be
With you right here next to me
Life's a piece of cake
With someone to give
And someone to take
Life's a piece of pie
With someone to wash
And someone to dry
Life's an easy road
With someone beside you to share the load
Life is full of highs
With someone to stir
And someone to fry
Life's a leg of lamb
With someone there to lend a hand
Life's a bunch of flowers
With someone to while away the hours
Life's a filet of fish, eh!
Yes, it is
Life's a happy song, when there's someone by your side to sing along

Oh
I've got everything that I need
Right in front of me
Nothing's stopping me
Nothing that I can't be
With you right here next to me
I've got everything that I need

Right in front of me
Sorry, I was super excited

Oh, this is the most romantic thing ever. I've always dreamt of seeing Los Angeles

I know, Walter can't wait either. You don't mind that he's coming, right?

Oh, no. No, of course not. As long as we can spend our anniversary dinner together, that's all I ask

Let me go check on Walter
Everything's great
Everything's grand
Except Gary's always off with his friend
It's never me and him
It's always me and him and him
I wonder when it's going to end?
But I guess that's okay
'Cause maybe someday
I know just how it's going to be
He'll ride up on a steed
And get down on one knee
And say, "Mary, will you marry me please?"

I've got everything that I need right in front of me
Nothing's stopping me
Nothing that I can't be
With you right here next to me
You've got everything that you need
Right in front of you
Nothing's stopping you
Nothing that you can't do you
That the world can throw at you
Life's a happy song
When there's someone by your side to sing
Life's a happy song
When there's someone by your side to sing
Life's a happy song
When there's someone by your side to sing
