So weathered
Worn and battered
I will stay
Keep treading
As I'm dreading the waves

My hands are tied
But I will make it
I'm not shaken
Even when my mind's exhausted, I survive
And the world tries to drown you out (I survive)
Flooding your life like water-filled lungs (I survive)

Waiting for the day
This storm will pass and leave my life
It only makes me stronger
I don't want to wait
But all that has been on my mind
Is how much longer?

My heart is tired but it's not breaking (It's not breaking)
Now I'm awakened (I'm awakened)

I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken

But I haven't yet
Letting go
Is how I can start to fight my way
Out of this hole I've dug
In this war against myself (this war against myself)
But I haven't yet (but I haven't yet)

Don't catch me at the wrong time or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had (wished I never had)
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
But I fear it will never leave me (but I fear it will never leave me)

Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know

I know I need to let go
Of everything that has
Ever made me think myself better
I'm not better than anyone else
Of anything that's filled me with anger
That I have taken out on everyone else (on everyone else)
These demons will never leave me
I can only find ways to not let them out
These demons will never leave me
But I control them, not the other way 

Like a flame burnt out
You're a shadow of yourself
A memory blacked out
The bridge has been burned down
Less is learned in time
When you fade to the background
Will you take my hand?
We will walk this road
We can change the map
I won't fade away
I know you've been hurt
But I will swear to stay

I can be your strength
To find your way back home

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away

Like a thought recalled
Picked up when we fall
Held fast through it all
All these wars with you
Learned to make it through
You know our hearts are true
Now don't look to the past
Leave the thoughts you had
Those words and things you've planned
We won't fade again
We're all broken
We'll make it in the end

I can be your strength
To find your way back home

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away
Rise higher
Your mind is an echo
Your mind is an echo
Shine brighter
Get out of the shadows
Get out of the shadows
I won't fade away

I won't fade away
Like the ones before
I won't let you down
We'll leave them miles away
I know your heart's been torn
I won't let you down
However long it takes
I will, I will never break
Whatever path we take
I won't, I won't fade away

I won't fade away
I won't fade 

Am I still breathing?
Then nothing is as bad as it seems
So just keep breathing, and keep calm, keep calm
The only real control we have is over ourselves
So let's get over it
That we can't and we won't control anything else
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
You can't lose something you never had
So why miss the memory of something (of something) that didn't exist?
Everything is all right, just keep calm, keep calm
But everything is all right, just keep calm, keep calm

Sometimes I feel so wrong
Like I'm being held down
I feel my heart like a rock, it's sinking
These days can get so dark
Like an eclipse in the sky
But I can rise above
I can find the light

I can run
I can change all the answers
Or what I'll hope they'll be
I won't stop
I won't let my own questions
Fade away in my dreams
Don't fade away

We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out?
We are the one true hope

Stand up
You have a voice to be heard
You're worth more than words
So let your fire burn
Oh, your flame will be lit
Again when a candle is burned at both ends
And there's nothing left

You can change
You can become selfless
You're not set in stone
You will wade through mistakes that we all make
But just hold on
