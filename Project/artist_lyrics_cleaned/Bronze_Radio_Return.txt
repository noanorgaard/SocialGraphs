Make a little fire pass a bottle ‘round
Ain’t no path, so follow all the sounds
Oh I’ll see you down there

You could tell two friends and they could tell five
We’ll all be here when Jack and Jim arrive
And it’ll be just us and the trees
And a little fresh air
And when the whiskey’s all gone and the night grows old
There's no more sense in the stories told
We can laugh down the path with smoke in our clothes
And find a little peace down there

So maybe I’ll see you down there
We’ll all get together for a while
So maybe I’ll see you down there
Everyone together for a while
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh, I’ll see you there

Meet me in the city where the street's run down
Gather up a crowd in an empty town
It's where the people speed up and the time slows down
Oh, I’ll see you down there

We wrote on the wall in a crooked line
The same song plays that we heard so many times
And now we’ll hear it down there

So maybe I’ll see you down there
We’ll all get together for a while
So maybe I’ll see you down there
Everyone together for a while
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh maybe I’ll see you down there
We’ll all get together for a while
Oh maybe I’ll see you down there
Everyone together for a while
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh, I’ll see you there
Oh, I’ll see you 

So many angles, so many lines
So many ways to see the sunrise

'Cause everything moves, everything pulses
Everything lies in the eyes of you
Everything moves, everything pulses
Everything lies in the eyes of you
Everything lies in the eyes of you
In the eyes of you, in the eyes of you

Ramble on, chug along
And if the beat stops thumping, man, then something’s wrong
Ignore it son, it's just a song
But I can see your white-knuckled hand from holding on
So lately I wonder why we rely on the sure thing
It's too damn comforting
To stay alive, overdrive, 'til we find something new
To keep the pulse alive in you

Even though I don’t know quite what to do
The time will show what we know is hardly ever true
I’d rather have then never had the spinning room
The feeling that I moved
No more standing still at your will but you can try until you see the motion's moving you

'Cause everything moves, everything pulses
Everything lies in the eyes of you
Everything moves, everything pulses
Everything lies in the eyes of you
Everything lies in the eyes of you
In the eyes of you, in the eyes of 

Shake, shake, shake
It's all that you make of it, take what you will
You know, know, know your only mistake
Is if you stand still
So shake, shake, shake
It's all what you make of it, break it until
You know, know, know your only mistake
Is if you stand still

It's only up to you
It's only up to you
Forget yourself
This room is hot, but we can make it hotter with your help
I'll dance with you
We'll dance together until everybody's moving too
Everybody moves
When everybody moves

1 ContributorMelting in My Icebox LyricsYou've got a feeling, it's in a moment. Want to keep it but it's always fleeting. Cause when I'm feeling with the present, then the light's gone and I can never keep it
I dig my fears in, try to keep my eye on you. I disappear and get it, when I blink it never shares. Wanna stop that drops, dripping from a cold cone. Before I can finish I'm a bottle on a corpse stone
It's melting in my icebox. It's leaking all my time. It's melting in my icebox. Why can't I keep a moment frozen?
Everything's surrounding me, I watch a moment turn into a memory. Like you mean one of my king, it come down when you leave. Soak it up, it's only temporary
It's melting in my icebox. It's leaking all my time. It's melting in my icebox. Why can't I keep a moment frozen? Why can't I keep a moment frozen?
Mixing ice cubes, turning into water. Wanna keep it, but it's getting harder. Wanna keep it, but it's getting harder. Mixing ice cubes, turning into water
It's melting in my icebox. It's leaking all my time. It's melting in my icebox. Why can't I keep a moment frozen? Melting in my icebox (turning into water). Melting in my icebox (turning into water). It's melting in my icebox (turning into water). It's melting in my icebox, why can't I keep a moment frozen?You might also
