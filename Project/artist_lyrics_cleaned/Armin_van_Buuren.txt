And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Nothing to hold but the memories in frames
Oh, they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown (Ooh, ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Somebody save me, I’m going down

And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

No, I don’t even know if I’m alive
