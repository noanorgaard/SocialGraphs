Bringin' it home it’s the relayed laps; twist cats, put ‘em on they ass
The other half on they neck and they back
Prepare your vest for the Victory Laps
Take titles and give ‘em back, World Series Hummers
Veteran numbers, still spit that crack
Bottles of Goose in the backpack
Niggas talkin' like ‘Yeah Tony Starks, don’t you dare let us down
Your hits be immaculate, and accurate’
Like the targets of Jake Plummer (word!)
Started all that talk of bein' a gunner
Beef in the winter leaves the death in the summer
Switchin' the Franks, army tanks
Fuck a bodyguard, it’s me and the iron
I’m secure like federal banks, pirates
Y’all niggas better walk the plank, motherfucker!

Bluka! Bluka!
Compliments of the gentlemen in all black
In the back, softball stack off the wall plaque
For all slack, track who diss is tricky
Hope to fix the problem with the rack & pinion doohickey
Not too quickly, they softer than a gooch
As I proceed to pop the clutch like a cooch, brooch
It broke loose, scratched the side slidin'
Disappeared off of the horizon, glidin'
You’re now ridin' with the rude gin and ginseng drinkin'
Sing a Sting song smooth as mink skin
Drop a jewel to keep the king’s men thinkin'
Filthy Metal Fingers leave the ink pen stinkin'
Move! The lab is in a mess
Wreakin', speakin' from the heart like a stabbin' in the chest
Leakin' in a cab in distress, blinkin', home
Poems ringin' in his dome, clingin' to 

Ayo, New York, New York, big city of dreams
But some dreams get flushed out and turned to the fiends
By all means it's 24 hours of work
Some niggas got that Sour D and some got dirt
Some is out to bust they heat and some just squirt
Some bitches can shake they asses, some can't twerk
You got Times Square square times, they got lame rhymes
This is Ghost shit, I fuck rats and dimes
These signs are so vivid, the street lights are blaring
You got filthy rich and greedy niggas you ain't sharing
Five boroughs, bitches of all flavors
Crooked cops locking my peoples behind cages
Wrecking majors, the Diamond District
Body bags are all stacked up as another statistic
Dirty water dogs or Morton's Steakhouse fillets
Staten Island, New York, I love my Shaolin ways

Evil thoughts can lead to some positive energy
New York, New York, the baddest place of the century
Bad as in good, good as in hood
Evil lurks in the shadow, I wish a nigga would
Positive thoughts can lead to some negative energy
New York, New York, the baddest place of the century

Salute!
Most of the livest dudes is dead
Some folks being polite, some rude instead
The meltin' pot is overflowin' with lead
In the winter it's brick, the summertime is like a sweltering hotbed
Manhattan keeps on makin', shakin' fake tits and bacon bits
Put it on a ritz for shakin' glitz in the snake pit
Bootleg bags off Canal is bogus cow skin
You might could see the Riker’s Isle bus go past every now and then
Thousands of skeletons found under ground zero
Hundreds of years old remains of the brown negro
Built on the backs of immigrants in search of a better life
But all they get is credit as stress and debt as strife
Or read your rights, dead wrong or dead right
Erry night, zombie starin', deer stuck in the headlights
Up in Harlem, got that work
Come and get De Nada Pinata and get jerked

Bad as in good, good as in hood
Evil lurks in the shadow, I wish a nigga
