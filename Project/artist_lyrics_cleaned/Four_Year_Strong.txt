Will your legs fail you
When you stand too straight and tall
'Cause in a world gone mad
The taller you are, the harder you fall

Sail up into the night sky
Until our worlds collide
Whoa, whoa
Tonight we feel alive
Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
Whoa, whoa
Tonight we feel alive

You asked, what would I stand for?
Truth is
I stand for this
It’s passion perfected
Fashion neglected
A natural infection of all we have seen
It's the only way
Since we discovered we have a say
Found that the world's not as cold and grey
As our circumstances
And second chances
Living out the days

Will your legs fail you
When you stand too straight and tall
'Cause in a world gone mad
The taller you are, the harder you fall
I won't stand for it

Sail up into the night sky
Until our worlds collide
Whoa, whoa
Tonight we feel alive
Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
Whoa, whoa
Tonight we feel alive
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Stand up where I can see you
No reason left to hide
It's the only way

It's the only way
Tonight we feel alive

Will I ever know what it's called when I see it?
Will I feel like it's there when I call?
Will I crawl to the end of everything that I've ever known
Just to prove I can conquer it all?
But still, I know that I am just what you needed
I count to 10 but still, I'm defeated
Every time that you turn to go
And still, I hang on every word that you mutter
Bite the tongue and choke out the stutter
Every time that you say hello

Time rolls on
Still, I feel like it's already gone

It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth in perfect symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history

Is there anyone out there?
Or am I doing this on my own?
This time I'm gonna
Take the world on, bracing for impact
Cross my fingers, hope and believe that
You'll be right by my side

Time rolls on
Now I feel like it's taking way too long

It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth in perfect symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history

I know my days are numbered
So I'm making them count
I've left those minutes behind me
Without a second of doubt

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh
It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth in perfect symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in history
It's never too late to keep your head straight
Move your hands back and forth in perfect symmetry
So you can live like a time bomb that doesn't have long
Go down in 

So get a grip
You’re losing it
Your time is fading fast
I won't waste another second picking you up when you’re falling

Back away I’m anything but okay
What’s the point of living if you’re already dead?
So take the best of anything I have left
I won't waste my days hating myself to death

What’s left to say?
I’ve been heading down this road, or so I’m told
Apparently I’m out of control
Apparently I’m about to explode
I never thought that I’d be giving you up
I never thought that I’d be giving you up
I never thought that you’d be holding me back
I never thought that you’d be holding me back

Don’t forget to stop and take a breath
Before your lungs have nothing left

Gravity, please don’t let go of me
Just keep me from drifting through the atmosphere until I disappear
Every day I’m another world away from where I’m supposed to be
So gravity, don’t let go of me

So sick from the altitude
The higher I go the more that I lose
It's alright I’ll be fine
I wouldn’t mind if I was just falling
Because when I hit the ground I'll be running
What’s the worst that could happen anyway?

While I’m drifting away
I hope that you’d stay awake and wait for me
But I know you’ll just fall back to sleep
I know my time is winding down
So you’ll find me floating out among the clouds

I’ll watch the world go up in flames
I’ll strike the match to help you do the same
The time is now, tick tock, it's ticking away
So now I’m here to rain on your parade

So take a look in the mirror
“Who’s that?"
Someone in fear of running out of good places to hide
Crawl out from the dark
Feel the light hit your face
It will never be as bright as the spotlight you crave
But watch out before it burns you

Don’t let it go to your head
I’m not here for my health
If I was then I’d be dead
Instead I’m testing my patience waiting around for you to be gracious
I’ll never let go

Don’t be afraid
I’m on the front lines to fight for you
Stop putting words in my mouth
They taste better when they’re coming out
Still I can’t help but choke them down when you’re around but I can’t seem to keep it down

Last time I said goodbye I thought my good years were washed up;
Hung out to dry
With the mindset that everything was fine but then I realized
That it was right in front of my eyes

Don’t be afraid
I’m on the front lines to fight for you
Stop putting words in my mouth
They taste better when they’re coming out
Still I can’t help but choke them down when you’re around but I can’t seem to keep it down

Watch the dust start to rise through the air
I don’t know if it ever comes back again
Breathe it in so I never forget where we came from

Don’t put out the fire
It’s been a summer like no other but it’s never enough
And although my bones are tired I won't change a thing

Bear the crown, we lived like royals
Who the hell would know because my brain is boiled
Still we all play the game
In the sun and the rain
Because this madness feeds our sanity

Feel the heat as it’s beating me down
I don’t know if ill ever get up again
Take it in so I never forget where we came from

If you're gonna tear me down (tear me down)
Then you better have  both feet planted on the ground

Whoa
Open up your eyes and let the light in
Whoa
Take a shot in the dark
I've got my ear to the ground and my eye on the prize
Take a leap of faith without learning to fly
It's my time to shine
I'm gonna light up the world
Til I'm the last one standing

Locked inside a room without a door
Found a crack spreading out along the floor
I saw bright light through the divide
So I dug my way through to the other side
What happened to the burning desire
For you to pull yourself back to your feet

This time I'll stand through the winter, last through the night
Just keep your head down and you’ll be alright
For the last time, I try to hide
What you’ve been trying to find

Will we go down like the rest of them?
Living up to the little mistakes
Fitting into the molds I’ve broken time and time again
Not if I can help it

I will never understand how just a few words can break a man
You’ve got to pay for what you say and what you do
Ill be taking it all in stride
Ill be leaving it all behind me
So forget everything that you think I know
Everything that you won't let go

Its time that you realize those days are gone
And they’re never coming back

So this is the sound of your heart
Well I thought it would be louder
The beats might be too far apart
When they slow to a stop you’ll be dying to get back to the start

Sell your soul for a ticket to ride
You’ve been trying to find a reason to feel more alive
I’ve been calling the shots for as long as I can
So you’re on your own and now you know what its like to
Stand alone
