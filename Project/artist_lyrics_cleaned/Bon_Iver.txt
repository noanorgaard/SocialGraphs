My mile could not
Pump the plumb
In my arbor 'till my ardor trumped
Every inner inertia
Lump sum
All at once
Rushing from the sub-pump
(Or so the story goes)
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm
Ahh, ahh, ahhYou might also 

Still alive, who you love
Still alive, who you love
Still alive, who you love

In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, is pouring; wire it up!
You're breaking your groundYou might also 

And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
That you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?"
As the moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well

A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're fabric now

Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns
Threw the meaning out the door
(Now could you be a friend)
There's no meaning anymore

Motor up and yeah, you're own, ooh
And yeah you're on your own

Fold the map and mend the gap
And I tow the word companion
And I make my self escape
Oh, the multitude of other
It comes always off the page

I hold the note
You wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies
Sub find
Some 

From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I'd a tore your hair out just to climb back, darling
When you're filling out your only form
Can you tell that it's just ceremon’?
Now you've added up to what you're from
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Build your tether rain-out from your fragments
Break the sailor's table on your sacrum
Fuck the fiercest fables, I’m with Hagen

For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, you're standing on my sternum
Don't you climb down, darling
Oh, the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when you're drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests

'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't
Here in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
No, you don't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
If you don't
No, you won't

I close my eyes
I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me "Lip Parade"
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, 

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My my my, my my my, my my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient

And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far 

Hair, old, long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space

Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one, face 'way from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss

Joy, it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside

So it's storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break
There's a fire going out
But there's really nothing to the south
Swollen orange and light let through
Your one-piece swimmer stuck to you

Sold, I'm ever
Open ears and open eyes, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh, the demons come, they can subside

"...really great. Sorry, I like, really don't want to be with people right now. I can't really do 

I keep throwing it down, two–
–hundred at a time
And it's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell

On your back with the racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks of the stacks are your load
In the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load

I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?

This is not the sound of a new man
Or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
