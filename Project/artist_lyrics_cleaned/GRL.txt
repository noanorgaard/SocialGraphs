(Hey boy tell me) Will you'll be there when I need you?
(Hey boy tell me) Why should I just believe you?
Don't get me wrong, I'm into you but I'm just not that girl
(So don't just tell me) Baby, show me what you're made of

If you wanna be with me
Show me what you go-ot
Go ahead and let me see
Show me what you go-ot

You're trying to get it popping
You're trying to change my mind
You're trying to take me home tonight
But you should take your time
And maybe I'm old fashioned
Or maybe you're too fresh
'Cause you could be a billionaire
But that won't get you this

And I wonder, does it blow your mind?
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine, anymore

Okay, you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay, you're Cover Boy pretty, stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Maybe you'll get married, and she will kiss your feet
While I give all my rides away, I won't lose no sleep
Maybe on your honeymoon you'll think of me
But if you don't, won't shed a tear, yeah I can guarantee

And I wonder, does it blow your mind?
