With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumpin' into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothin', now it's gold
And it's all on you
With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumpin' into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothin', now it's gold
And it's all on you

(You)
(I get my kicks from you)


Can't see, dark road, drivin' up the hills
Lookin' at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got nowhere to go
We can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know
