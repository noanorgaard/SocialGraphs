She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said, "I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise"
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back 

T.I.P., coming live from the V.I.P. 
Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the Feds and the state wanna see 'bout me
The whole city gon' berserk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed?
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town

I got the crowd yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")

Once again, what other rap nigga hood-er than this?
I got rich, and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rapping 'bout blow, I was moving the shit
You talking 'bout shooting out, and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case, I know I'll truly be missed
So I'ma – keep a cool head, stay out of the news headline
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

I got a packed house yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")

Uh-y-yeah! Mic check, one-two, one-two
You wanna beef with the King? What is you' gon do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend gon' play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show them this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with 9's, AK's, and TECs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best
'Cuz we standin' in your front yard yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin'("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' ("Bring 'em out, bring 'em out")

From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up

I guess I’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her

To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around's a conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants – they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in
Saying the kind of shit I be like "if you was a man
I would go in your shit, for real, no shit"
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I’m sick
Still, I don’t like to feel like this
If I didn’t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick

Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned (Bah)

I just laugh at nigga, wishin' they were this hot (Ha-ha)
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I'm the Jetsons, you the Flintstones

Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over, never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib, must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't buy a soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye Cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos? I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair, I wouldn't dye for ya

Look, bet all you see is tats, money, grills, and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names change but the situation still the same
The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out
Flip another seven grams, oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags sell it fast stack a G now you officially

Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind
Shit you come to get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow, do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say the want some weight, tell them niggas stand in line

(Stay with me now shawty, here comes the fun part)

Now the robbers plottin' on ya and your name stay buzzin'
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
He know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snictchin' on you and it's true
Everybody know you sell that shit
The feds come and get ya, shit we heard you
Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble

Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you 'posed to be
A lady to the naked eye, but a nasty lil' ho to me
If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear (I swear)
Manhandle you in public places, I'll make you take it right here
You got no idea (Idea)
Listen, girl, with this pole right here, I'll

Now can you just kiss it for me
While I'm doin' 'bout a hundred on the highway?
Get it sloppy wet, get it bent
Girl, I bet you could finish 'fore I pull up on the driveway

But shawty, I'm sayin', now

Be talkin' 'bout me, I highly doubt it
So, let me take you to a private island
Make you take this dick, don't cry about it
How it feel to you, girl? Don't lie about it
No, shawty, you ain't gotta lie about it
Blackin' out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man? Well, he gonna be sour 'bout it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me rock solid, come touch that
I'm fuckin' you like I'm upset
Chokin' you, long strokin' you

All day, contemplatin', baby, waitin' patiently
There's no body like your body when you climb on top of me
We're in hell and lady, you're the closest thing to heavenly
I want you all to myself
Nothin' at all, I can't help it
'Cause what you got on is fly as hell
But I need a better view, just show me the real you

Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
