Well, I got this feeling
That time's just holdin' me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight, I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

You're playin' so cool
Obeyin' every rule
But dig way down in your heart
You're burnin', yearnin' for some

Somebody to tell you
Life ain't passin' you by
I'm tryin' to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-ee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
Come on, come on, let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
(First) You've got to turn it around
(Second) And put your feet on the ground
(Third) Now take ahold of your soul
I'm turnin' it loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

(Footloose)
Footloose (Footloose)
Kick off your Sunday shoes (Kick 'em on off)
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back (Get on back, Jack)
Come on before we crack (Come on before we)
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
(Everybody)
Everybody cut 

Do what you like
Doin' it naturally
But if it's too easy
They're gonna disagree
It's your life
And isn't it a mystery?
If it's nobody's business
It's everybody's game

Got to catch you later
No, now, can you pull it right away?
Some Cinderella kid
Get it up and get you a job

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh, yeah

Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take it right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take it right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take it right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take it right into the danger
