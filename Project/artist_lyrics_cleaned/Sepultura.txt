I believe in our fate
We don't need to fake
It's all we wanna be
Watch me freak

I say we're growing every day
Getting stronger in every way
I'll take you to a place where we shall find our

Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots (Roots)
Roots, bloody roots (Roots)

Rain, bring me the strength
To get to another day
And all I wanna see
Set us free

Why can't you see? Can't you feel?
This is real, oh


I pray, we don't need to change
Our ways to be saved
That's all we wanna be
Watch us freak
