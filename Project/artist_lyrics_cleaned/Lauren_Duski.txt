And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu

Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...

You might also like
You... Déjà vu
Déjà vu

I won't ever get used to watching me lose you
Over and over again
I've gotten good pretending that I'm okay
But up here in my head
I see you close on the carpet, your arms all around me
On the floor in the living room
And I almost believed that
I'm really here with you

And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu

Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back
It all comes back to...
You and I were meant to be
But only in a memory
You're all I want
You're all I see
It all comes back
Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...
I watch us fall too fast, I can't escape the
Love we made, the fights we had
The slamming doors and broken glass
Just like that, it all comes back to you
And just like that, it all comes back to you
Déjà
