I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

Day in day out, I've asked many questions (I say)
Only to find the truth it never changes (I say)
If you don't deal with it, it keeps killing you a little by little (I say)
Call me selfish if you will, my life I alone I can live (I say, I say)

I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(In a way now)
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

I don't care if it hurts, I'm tired of lies and all these games
I've reached a point in life, hey, no longer can I be this way
Don't come crying to me, I too have shed my share of tears
I'm moving on, yes I'm grooving on
Hey, well I'm finally free

I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(Come on now)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to myself (In a way oh)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to 
1 ContributorCry, Cry, Cry (Live From Soho) LyricsHey… I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I’m too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I’m gonna give it a fight
I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I’ll be your friend
And you know I don’t like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song

Well now….I’m gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me

Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don’t be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that’s all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow

Mama’s telling me what to eat today
But I don’t feel like I’m gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright
I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I’m gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Set the children free. Set the children free
Set the children free
Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination
Set the children free
Set the children 

I may be different than you, criticized for what I do
I chose to explore the truth, the truth of me
And I won't be afraid, on that day
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah
Took the risk, the chance, just to understand
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you

'Cause a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And a lifetime isn't enough to live
Oh, a lifetime isn't enough to love you
And one lifetime isn't enough to live

Been around so many people, without you I'm always alone
Gazing into space, my existence unknown
I don't want to be here, I wanna be near
I stand on my feet, because I am yeah
Took the risk, the chance, just to understand
Well I been cold, bold, selfish, misunderstood
Like the lamb I will sacrifice to find you
