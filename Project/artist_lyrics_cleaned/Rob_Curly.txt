This... is paradise. Relax
And there she goes
Moving on with Mr. Wrong
Guess I really need Myspace
Guess I should have stuck with Tom
Slippers on, camos on, yes I got my sleeveless on
Wear my heart up on my sleeve
Guess my heart is not involved
Mystery, not solved
Why she left and never called
Trip on love but never fall
I never
