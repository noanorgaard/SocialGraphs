Call out your name
Ease your head
Call out your name
It, It, It is inevitable
It, It, It is inevitable
I was only waitin' for the sound, girl
Darlin' we'll be waitin' for the sound
It, It, It is inevitable
Ease your head
Call out your name
Ease your head
Call out your name
Is it enough?
It is
Is it enough?
It is
It, It, It is inevitable
It, It, It is inevitable
I was only waitin' for the sound, girl
Darlin' we'll be waitin' for the sound
It, It, It is inevitable
