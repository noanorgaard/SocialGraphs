Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done
Love with another or several others, I'm done, I'm done
Flex your way outta here, go flex your way outta here
Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done

Yeah, you are not the same and don't pretend you are
Why should I be feeling so alone when we're just chillin'?
Girl, I don't know what to say to ya
Other than I know I fucked up, I'm sorry, yeah
And I held you down when no one was around
Will you stop me if I'm leaving?

Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done
Love with another or several others, I'm done, I'm done
Flex your way outta here, go flex your way outta here
Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done

Split seconds don't mean a thing when the days are this toxic

Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done
Love with another or several others, I'm done, I'm done
Flex your way outta here, go flex your way outta here
Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done
Go ahead and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm done
Love with another or several others, I'm done, I'm done
Flex your way outta here, go flex your way outta here
Go 'head and play with another, not me - I'm done, I'm
