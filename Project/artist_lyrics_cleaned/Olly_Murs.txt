My name is Olly, nice to meet you, can I tell you baby?
Look around, there’s a whole lot of pretty ladies
But none like you, you shine so bright, yeah
I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute
On the floor up close gettin' lost in it
I won’t give up without a fight

I just wanna, oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on, oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight

We’re getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now
Loosen up and let you hands go down, down
Go with it girl, yeah, just close your eyes, yeah
I feel the music moving through your body
Lookin' at you, I can tell you want me
Don’t stop, keep going till the morning light, yeah
When I saw you there
Sittin' all alone in the dark acting like you didn’t have a care
I knew right then, that you’d be mine
And we’d be dancin' the whole damn night right

I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees, huh

You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so high, I can't come down

All this spell you got me under

After a drink or two, I was putty in your hands

Trouble-troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name (Oh-oh)
I know you're no good, but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? (Woah)
My mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
I say I'm done, but then you pull me back (Woah)
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
'Cause I keep comin' back again for more (Oh-oh)
