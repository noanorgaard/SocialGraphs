And I ripped these walls apart
And I went and shot an arrow right through your heart
But how those times have changed
Cause now you don't remember my name

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I guess I played my cards too late
Cause now my body can't take the weight
And once we flew so high, oh
But now I'm afraid to fly, oh oh oh

And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm sorry that I'm here so late
And please don't turn my heart away
For your love, I can change, cause without you, I'm so hollow
I'm sorry that I let you go
It's only when it's lost you know
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
Seeing you, missing you, such a bitter pill to swallow
No, oh, oh
No, oh, oh


Oooooooooh
Ooooohohoooooh
Oooohoooooooh
Ohoooohohohoooooh

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me

In front of me ooh
But I don't wanna know
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Home
If I let you go

Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
Oh you don't

Oooooohhhhh
So I won't say I love you if you
