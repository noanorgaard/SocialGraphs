Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with
Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think, I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think, I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think, I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think, I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have to do
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's "RSVP"
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time
A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?
So on, with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
"I'm spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break, this year's been crazy"
I said, "Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending
