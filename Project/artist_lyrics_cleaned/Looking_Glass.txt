The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea

And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around

She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it is
"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love, and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is, it
