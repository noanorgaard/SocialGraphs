I done went through just about two bags of tissues, baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue, baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you, baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say?
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (One time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (Two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough
To even give me half the love I gave to you
I live for you, baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
'Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back

I wanna go but I keep coming back

I can't stop, I
I can't stop, I can't stop missing you baby
I, I, I can't stop
I, I, I can't

I stay 'cause I love you, but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go, that's why you treat me this way
I wanna be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back

Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!
Keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish

And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down (Ooh, I feel so)
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say?

But I guess forever, doesn't last too long
Forever doesn't last too long
Forever doesn't last too long these days, hey
And I tried to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that
Forever doesn't last too long these days, hey

Still think about the good times we had
And how you used to make me laugh
But baby, I know most times we were miserable
So everytime I wanna call, baby, what always helps
Is when I think of the pain, and I realize
I'm better off by myself

'Cause forever, doesn't last too long
Forever doesn't last too long
Forever doesn't last too long these days, hey
And I tried to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that
Forever doesn't last too long these days, hey

Lord knows I gave it my all and

And I tried to believe that we could make it
But trying don't work, so I just have to face that

So I never leave the house without makeup on
I keep mascara in my pocket if I'm running to the market
‘Cause you never know who's watching you
So I got to stay on, I got to stay on
I got to stay on, I got to stay on
Said I got to stay on

No, I ain't got a job, but so what?
I don't need it when I'm getting everything that I want
And everything that I ask for
I wear that freakum dress for Daddy and he give me more
And them bitches stay mad cause they working so hard
While I'm working so smart, oh
It's a small price to pay when you're living this good
And it keep me in the hills, and it kept me out the hood
‘Cause it's new chicks poppin' up everyday
And they want the same thang

Now, I know why you're looking at me like that
It ain't attractive when you're looking at me like that
Girl, don't be mad cause while you're
Cooking dinner for your broke nigga
You could be in the gym working on your figure like me
So, don't I deserve to be privileged?
Don't I deserve to get the very best?
‘Cause it ain't easy being this fine all the time
‘Cause if it was, then we all could do it
But we can't now, no, so bitch don't kill my vibe
Don't be mad cause you coach class and I'm in that G5
Beautiful girls run the whole world
That's why I got to stay on!
