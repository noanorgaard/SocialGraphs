I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ah, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
You might also like
I said, “I love you,” that's forever
And this, I promise from the heart, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are

All right

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are, 

Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun

Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah

And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You said your mother told you, "All that I could give you was a reputation"
Aww, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh woah woah

Well, come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

You know that only the good die young
Tell you, baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young

Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Only the good die young
Only the good die

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone


Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' 

So, you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile
Mmm-hmm

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smiling
Oh, yeah, yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call

And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Oh, but still your finger's gonna pick your nose

And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smiling
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah

So, you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for?
Mmm-hmm

So, you've got everything, ah, but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore
But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smiling
La-la-la
Oh, yeah, yeah

So, you play your albums and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parkin' lot
Oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong?
Mmm-hmm

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you're twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long
Oh, oh, oh, woah, yeah, yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Well, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smiling
Oh, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
Take you to your special island
Well, now Captain Jack could make you die tonight
Just a little push and you’ll be smiling
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will make you die tonight
Well, now Captain Jack will make you die tonight
Just a little push and you'll be

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
Shе's got a choice

But maybе, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown

She'll see I'm not so tough

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound funny
But it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the Miracle Mile?

Nowadays, you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town, but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
Well you could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You'd get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
(Alright, Richie!)

Woo!
Ooh...
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much

Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
All ya need are looks and a whole lotta money

It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze
Anyways – it's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound funny
But it's still rock and roll to 

So I could own my downeaster "Alexa"
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there, but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my downeaster "Alexa"
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my downeaster "Alexa"
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
I was a bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me

Yay-yay-yay-o
Yay-yay-yay-o
Yay-yay-yay-o


Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed his shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.​

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance

I never said I was a victim of circumstance

That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
