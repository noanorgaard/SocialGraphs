I cannot stand all the drama, the Gaza
They talkin', they movin' like zombies
Trustin' nobody
I cannot love her, but I said I love her
'Cause I was so gone off the molly
Sorry, not sorry
Roll up deep to the party
Only Uber big body
'Til I cop that 'Rari
Push to start, no car key
I am so sick of these bitches, they trippin'
I swear that they learn from Kehlani
(Run this shit, no sweat
See me, don't see stress)

They talkin' that nonsense and fake conversations on me
Preein' and plottin', they hatin' on me
Couple would send a location on me
I got a lot on my conscience

(weighin', weighin' on me)
What do I see through these Cartier frames? (Yuh)
Big bands in my vault
I said watch me flaunt
I said watch me bop
Killy be hoggin' the ball (ya!)
Skrrt off in foreign, I'm gone
I see you see me from far
Keep tryna be me, it's hard
Flex on you, I hurt ya heart
Commas, they comin' in proper
Smellin' like Dolce Gabanna
My gang, I'll never dishonor
Money, it made me piranha
Money, it gave me nirvana
My gang I'll never dishonor
I want the M like McDonald's
I want the M like McDonald's
I book a flight from out west
And the next day, I woke up out west of Toronto
(Hey, hey!)
Big bands in my vault (hey!)
Big bands in my vault (hey!)
Big bands in my vault
Big bands in my vault
BIg bands in my
