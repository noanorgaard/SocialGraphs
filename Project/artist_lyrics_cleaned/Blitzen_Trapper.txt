You can wear your fur like a river on fire
But you better be sure if you're makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on fire
So if you're gonna' get made, don't be afraid of what you've learned

On the day that I turned twenty-three
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
When suddenly a girl, her skin the color of a pearl
She wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
She was listenin' for the angels just like me
So I stood and looked about
I brushed the leaves off of my snout
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
You should've seen that girl go shaky at the knees
So I took her by the arm
We settled down upon a farm
And raised our children up as gently as you please
And now my fur has turned to skin
And I've been quickly ushered in
To a world that I confess I do not know
But I still dream of runnin' careless through the snow
And through the howlin' winds that blow
Across the ancient distant flow
It fill our bodies up like water 'til we know
You can wear your fur like a river on fire
But you better be sure if you're makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on fire
So if you're gonna' get made, don't be afraid of what you've
