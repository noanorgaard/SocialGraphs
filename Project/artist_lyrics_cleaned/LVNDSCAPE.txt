Do you ever
Wonder if the star shine out for you
I will never
Turn my back on our truth
On days of doubt
I would listen to you as a friend
Hope let you down
We'll take the future in our hands and walk it again


I'll be your raincoat, on high tide your sailboat
When the water falls from your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
And when the night comes, I'll be your light house
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
You might also like
I'll be your raincoat, on high tide your sailboat
When the water falls from your eyes
And when the night comes, I'll be your light house
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
Save you from waterfalls in your eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes
