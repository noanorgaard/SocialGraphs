California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade
Ooooooh, ooooooh, ohhhhhhhh

I got that good cologne
And I got that charm
I just need a pretty Cali girl
To put under my arm
And I know what you need darlin'
But I need it too
A little love and affection all night long
I got a whole bunch for you
I'm going out to

And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade

Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
There ain't nobody else to hold (no)
Now that I got you wrapped up in my arms
There ain't no other place to go
But

California, you're my last hope
Give me someone I can take home
And, I don't how much longer that I can wait
So make her 5'5", big brown eyes and sweet like lemonade

But we live
And we lie
And we love
And we cry
And we learn to survive
And we start asking why

I don't need no religion
Darling, you're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything, let it all go
Who are we, what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in

What if you never looked at me that way
What if you did, what if you didn't
What if you took the job and moved away
Forgot about us, forgot about love
But we got through diseases
You stayed for a reason
Your love keeps on preaching in me
What if you never looked at me that way
What if we stopped asking why

I don't need no religion
Darling, you're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything, let it all go
Who are we, what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in

I don't need no religion
You're enough to believe in

And when I'm at the gate you're waiting
Whenever my soul needs saving
You're the only one I'm praying to, to, to
I don't need no religion
You're enough to believe in
All this questioning everything, let it all go
Who are we, what would be all that I know
As you're enough to believe in
You're enough to believe
