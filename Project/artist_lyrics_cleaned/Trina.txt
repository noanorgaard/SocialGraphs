Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws

In the club buying bars, nipples hard in designer bras
All my niggas who getting cheese, throwback and the crispy Gs

So many names wanna fuck the Queen

JUMP! Give me the beat, then I'ma make it bump
Tell me what you wanna hear, damn, yes it can
Trouble with your man, I'ma pop my trunk
You ain't seen no chicks like mine, you ain't seen no flicks like mine
Gonna make you (UGH!) next to the subwoofers in my 6 by 9
Tell me that you like it raw, tell me that my dick is MWAH!
I might make you famous
And buy you watches by Maurice Lacroix
Tell me if it's new or old, tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold, say, "Ludacris, 6 million sold"
See I ain't got no time for games, and I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my Southern slang?

So anytime you need me call, winter summer spring or fall
It doesn't matter, come one come all

These rumors are senseless, your whispers are endless
We living ghetto fab, we spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad, your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores, you saw me grace The Source
You watched me work the Vibe, bitches, I works for mine
One time for these divas, two times for these Visas
Third time I come, I'm breezing, the ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up, I'ma keep it going back to back, I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques, keeping it hood, wet sex, keeping it good
Look, girl, you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll, pussy power, we in control
