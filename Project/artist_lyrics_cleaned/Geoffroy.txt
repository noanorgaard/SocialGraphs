Somehow this is what I'm used to
Easy as it goes
Smokin' on my downtime
Sleepin' on my own


You got me faded, stuck in a daze
Tryin' to keep up with your pace
But I'm growin' old
Guess I'm gettin' tired, oh
And I've been meanin' to tell you what's been on my mind
I'm just scared you'll leave, been left alone too many times

Somehow this is what I'm used to
Easy as it goes
Smokin' on my downtime
Sleepin' on my own
You might also like

Somehow this is what I'm used to
Easy as it goes
Smokin' on my downtime
Sleepin' on my own
