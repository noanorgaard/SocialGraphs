You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, "That's okay
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back."
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She says, "That's alright
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be, let me be

She said, "I have to go home
Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright."
I said, "But unlock the door, I forgot the key."
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana-ana-ana-ana
Come on
Come
