Somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees

Yeah, somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, yeah
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothing but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day
No two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

But I saw the sunrise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson (Ha)
