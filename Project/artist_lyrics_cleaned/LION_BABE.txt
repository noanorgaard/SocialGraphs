I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out!)
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out)
That'll get you nowhere
You don't wanna see what happens when I get provoked
You don't wanna go there
See me spin around, see me swing my golden rope

Oh I got power (Wonder Woman powers)
I see signs
They shouting "Honey, (Wonder Woman powers)
Watch your behind!"
They can't catch me (watch out, watch out)
Cause I'm too strong
They all want what I got
Never leaving me alone

Come over here, let's talk awhile
Yeah you, I'm curious
What we'd do, the two of us
What would you like to do?
I'll introduce you to
My eyes, my lips, my hair
If you're good we'll go from there
I'm feeling you
And I know that you want me too
In the end, I'm doing me
That's all you got to see
Hey, that's just how it is
