All this time when you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find, I hid between the lines

We could dress for anywhere else
It's been a long, long time since your kingdom fell
But I can hear something over these engines
It sounds like ghosts in the back seat of your car
It sounds like our mysteries in skin, just to steal away again

All this time when you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find, I hid between the lines
All this time when you read my mind, you read my mind
Those countries where we could have been, I left them all behind
You might also like
Why would you bother the herd you're among?
When all that you needed was here all along?

All this time when you read my mind, you read my mind
All those thoughts that I knew you'd find, I hid between the lines
All this time when you read my mind, you read my mind
All those countries where we could have been, we left them all
