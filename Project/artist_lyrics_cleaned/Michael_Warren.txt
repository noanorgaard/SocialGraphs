Oh, I hate you
Fallin' to the bottom, wanna take you
Down another bottle, then I break you
Always throw my problems on the table
Fixin' up my head with a staple
Wishin' that I was fuckin' stable
I might end up dead, fuckin' hate you
Hate you, oh, my God, I hate you
Thinkin' of the past, wishin' I could fuckin' change you
True love never last, took my heart and left me broken
Opposites attract, lately, I've been feelin' hopeless

Yeah, I know we haven't talked in several months
In my head likе, "What the fuck?"
You cut my heart, then spillеd my guts
Damn, maybe that's my luck
Always fuckin' shit up, I always fuck it up
I've been sober for a minute now, and it fuckin' sucks
Chillin' in the background, I can never get enough
Oh, I really fuckin' hate you, yeah, I hate your fuckin' guts
You might also like
Sleep deprived, somewhat terrified, I'm tired for sure
Yeah, she's a liar, oh, dear, I've been so tired for years
I'm done with wastin' these tears
Turned a new leaf with no fear
Oh, I could swim into your thoughts like your drugs do
Fell into the ice when she screamed your name out
There was no way out, I can't even take it
It was such a close call, I just barely made it

Yeah, I know we haven't talked in several months
In my head like, "What the fuck?"
You cut my heart, then spilled my guts
Damn, maybe that's my luck
Always fuckin' shit up, I always fuck it up
I've been sober for a minute now, and it fuckin' sucks
Chillin' in the background, I can never get enough
Oh, I really fuckin' hate you, yeah, I hate your fuckin' guts
