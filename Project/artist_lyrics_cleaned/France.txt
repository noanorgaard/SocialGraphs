Scoundrel face
With friends from your neighborhood
You dance without looking at me
I hate you, and you hate me
And here everybody knows
You didn't even drink that much

I’ve been too scared to meet you at the dance
And forget why it ended
And if you see me turn my back
Go to the ground and cry
But lift up smiling at me

Don’t know what you’ll live for when I get there
So much better than you left me here

But sit on me, lay on me
Pretend that you were crazy
Lie to me, run from me
We swear we don’t count
In our own way
But it’s not because I hate you
That I can’t kiss your mouth no more
But sit on me, lay on me
Pretend that you were crazy
Lie to me, run from me
We swear we don’t count
In our own way
But it’s not because I hate you
That I can’t kiss your mouth no more
You might also like
If come we stay, if stay we fight
Don't call me Larissa, I'll dominate you
Around your neck, I hold our game
Deciding if I kiss you or if I kill you

Don’t know what you’ll live for when I get there
So much better than you left

But sit on me, lay on me
Pretend that you were crazy
Lie to me, run from me
We swear we don’t count
In our own way
But it’s not because I hate you
That I can’t kiss your mouth no more
But sit on me, lay on me
Pretend that you were crazy
Lie to me, run from me
We swear we don’t count
In our own way
But it’s not because I hate you
That I can’t kiss your mouth no more
Baby, I want to tell you
That nothing is worth more than my sitting
I’m saying it to your face
Baby, I’ve always been this way (Way, way)
But stop being like this
I’m saying it to your face
Come back to me

Lie to me, run from me
Pretend that you were (Go)
Crazy, in our own way
But it’s not because I hate you
That I can’t kiss your mouth no more
(Go,
