So, drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart
Drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart

We're just humans, nothing more
I wish it wasn't looking
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
We're just humans, nothing more
I wish it wasn't looking
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted

So, drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart
Drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart

We're just humans, nothing more
I wish it wasn't looking
'Cause we're haunted
For the next and the best
And for
