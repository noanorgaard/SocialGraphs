Because I'm fast enough to get in trouble and not fast enough to get away
And I'm old enough to know I'll end up dying and not young enough to forget again

It's all a fickle game
Life's a fickle game we play

I want to be older
I want to be stronger
I don't want to fall at the start
I want to be quicker
I want to get closer
I don't want to be worlds apart

Because I'm fast enough to get in trouble and not fast enough to get away
And I'm old enough to know I'll end up dying and not young enough to forget again

My friends have all left me, away on the breeze
There's a crushing silence where love's a disease
Like a fever it grips me, like a lover it holds
I'm scared of getting older, scared of dying alone
I'm in a blue haze, a blue haze

I'm carried on the back of a wave of gloom

I'm living in dark rooms, playing at God
I'm staring at blank walls, pretending I'm not

There's a crushing silence where love's a disease
Like a fever it grips me, like a lover it holds

Oh, and I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me
And I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me, talk some sense to me

And I'll use you as a makeshift gauge
Of how much to give and how much to take
Oh, I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense, then you'll lose your mind
