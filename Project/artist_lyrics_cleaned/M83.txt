There is no goodbye

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow


Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word (Waiting for a word)
Looking at the milky skyline (Skyline)
The city is my church (The city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight (Twilight)


Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark (Ride in the dark)
Waiting in the car (Car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land forever?

Across the time and space
A never-ending dance
A blooming and a trance
You make me feel my soul
There's no more loneliness
Only sparkles and sweat
There's no more single fate
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land forever?

My body is like a lightning rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips, and mine
Let's stay here forever

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land 

But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name

I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass simulacra
You might also like
I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of days

I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new
