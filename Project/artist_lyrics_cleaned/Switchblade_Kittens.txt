She is Miss Congeniality
Beauty myth eyes can only see
She made the standard for your reality
In time you will know
True friends always so
It was all just a lie
CHORUS: All cheerleaders die
In fear they unify
All cheerleaders die
All cheerleaders die
On the sidelines where you stood
You were not alone there, they all understood
Burn the idols carved of wood
Paper doll cutting even if you could
In time you will know
True friends always so
It was all just a lie
CHORUS
When it comes reunion time
You will wonder why you ever cried
She did it all just to survive
Exhale now and let go of that lie
You might also likeIn time you will know
True friends always so
It was all just a lie
