I'm obsessed with your passion for a love fest
I'm not the same
Typically so strange and just like you
Be your part, don't be confused in the start
(Is there any more that you want me to say?)
You tease me, when it goes too far, I cave
Is there any more that you want me to say?
Is there any more that you want me to say?
Is there any more

Let go
As the people try to talk to you
Love like you're supposed to
Let go
As the people love to talk to you
Hey, well that's a party now

Dumb down, to the words and sound of me now
My body shakes
As I just can't wait for you, anymore
So cut loose, let my passion through to your heart
(Is there any more that you want me to say?)
Unaware that I'm trapped in this love affair
Is there any more that you want me to say?
Is there any more that you want me to say?
Is there any more
Let go
As the people try to talk to you
Love like you're supposed to
Let go
As the people love to talk to you
Hey, well that's a party now

*Instrumental*

Let go
As the people try to talk to you
Love like you're supposed to
Let go
As the people love to talk to you
Hey, well that's a party now
Let go, oh
Let go, oh
Love, well that's a party
