I won't turn away
Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes round
You only see the stars when they fall like rain

When the night comes round
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain, yeah
Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain

Cause if your eye's on the ground
When the night comes down
You only see the stars when they fall like rain
Like rain, yeah
