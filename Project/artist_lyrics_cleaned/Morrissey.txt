You have never been in love
Until you've seen the stars
Reflect in the reservoirs
And you have never been in love
Until you've seen the dawn rise
Behind the home for the blind

We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the

First of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die

Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Oh my

You have never been in love
Until you've seen the sunlight thrown
Over smashed human bone

We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the

First of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy
Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the bullet in his gullet
And the first lost lad to go
Under the sod

And he stole from the rich and the poor
And the not very rich and the very poor
And he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
