1 ContributorStorehouse LyricsI had a dream that we packed away
All of our things into a boat for a long time
And we watched uneasily as the waters took
All our houses underneath as it climbed the mountainside
Plenty will there be from this year’s harvest
Even though the man said there wouldn’t be much
Rain in the ground for this year’s harvest
Adding to the storehouse, hallelujah!
And can you remember last year’s harvest?
Living in a dry land - how did we eat that year?
Was like a dead cloud hung above us
With an empty wind, but we had enough
Didn’t we? Didn’t we have enough?
Imagine this land being drenched with water till we can’t see...
Hearing it fall and resound and scatter
Till we can’t hear ourselves sing....
And plenty will there be from next year’s harvest -
Scattering the seeds with an open hand and
Remembering more than sparrows his thoughts are of us;
Even if the rain stops, hallelujah!You might also 
1 ContributorWhen Evening is Overwhelming LyricsIf you miss me then you know it -
It's not hard to understand
You don’t have to be a poet;
I'd love the words of your hand
And don't you know I weep with you gone?
That in my memory you’re beside me driving home?
I know it's on your mind when you're alone
I was angry, but now I long
If you miss me you can show it -
You don't have to pretend
And you don't have to be heroic
But I won't let you be my friend
The morning brings a knock on your door
And in your heart you feel uneasy as you cross the floor
What do you hear the voice of Jesus asking for?
I am waiting
(to God)
I belong to youYou might also
