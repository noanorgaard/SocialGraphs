We sharin' Sharon at the Sheraton 'cause sharin' is carin'
And Karen is starin' at me, I know she feelin' embarrassed
Grab her by the neck, say, "Bitch, don't ever disrespect me"
Pop the MAC-11 if your soul is feelin' empty
Not so much my enemies but more so my fans I do envy
Yuh, these hoes startin' a frenzy
My dick is feelin' so flimsy, I can barely keep up with a B cup
See, I ain't bring my A-game, can you keep up?
Fuck what you heard, piss on your dirt
Put in that work like private school girls in the first grade
Dade County, born and raised out the 305
Where hookers stick and jive with pocket knives, win the battle lose your life
Fuck your wife in my rusty pickup truck
The same kids you hangin' with the same ones yellin', "Stick em up"
I can resurrect you, I can pick you up out the mud, put you on to somethin'
Show you all the ropes, show you how that money grow

I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go
Never listen to your parents, trust me, they don't fucking know what's best for you like I do, yuh, ayy
You think I give a fuck about your IQ?

Your mama thinkin' you stupid because you bringin' in Fs
Givin' her stress and a couple knots in her chest
Nobody appreciate that you've been tryin' your best
I can show you how to give up and just hang from your neck
Your stepdaddy lookin' for your respect
I say fuck that, don't give it to him, fuck him and his rep
I know he getting on your nerves comin' home drunk as fuck
Beatin' on you and your mama
I say put one that in that llama and spit on him while he's sleepin'
Put a needle in his veins so the police think he was tweakin'
Tell your mama you was gone the whole weekend
Throw away the pistol, make sure nobody could reach it
Your life is better, ain't it? Told you that you need me
I can show you how to be the man
I can show you how to make your body count expand
I can show you how to multiply
Your profits, your pockets, your hoes, follow me and I promise

I can show you how to fuck your bitch
I can show you how to rip that condom off your dick and smack your mama in the lip
Let the children know it's lit
Drop out of school, you know you never had that on your bucket list
I can show you which way you should go

I pay my hoes, my bills, my homage
I never been to college
I sever the head of rappers
I pack the MAC-11 to send you to another dimension
Not to mention, I pop the Smith & Wesson with no second guessin'
Your bitch get to steppin'
Once I get it in, get wet, get out
Don't want to hear a word out of your mouth
What's up with that pussy? Don't doubt me
I can make it squirt while I skrrt in the Audi
Bitch, I'm outie after that, oddy's after that
Touch your Instagram, put you on the map
Don't discriminate, fuck a handicap, no legs
Fuck that, where your titties at, bitch?

Ba-Ba-Back in the Golden Days, I was glowin' rays
Now I'm soaked in grey from all these fuckin' growin' pains
Keep on throwin' shade, you'll meet the fuckin' Shogun's blade
I'm stealing trophies out your trophy case
Fuck the cards I was dealt
I got a poker face to steal an open base, ho
Fuck an older age though
If life's a book, rip out the last page and roll up a J Lo
Bitch, I'm Yung Plague, no way I'ma grow fangs
Rip out your throat, ain't sayin' anything out that hole, mane

Hundred pills bottles on my motherfuckin' dresser, mane
Couple lil' models all up in my Twitter mentions, mane
I'm the mane that'll make a stain out of your fuckin' brain
Smokin' strains off some strange grain that I can't explain
Fuck the fame, fuck these fuckin' lames, that's why I isolate
Can't relate to none of you motherfuckers
Keep me in my grave, hold up, wait
Duckin' in the shade, shooting up the H
Stuck at Hell's gates with Yung Plague
And I'm draped in
