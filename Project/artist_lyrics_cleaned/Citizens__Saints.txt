Oh God, you never leave my side
Your love will stand firm for all my life

In my searching, Oh God, you're near
In my wandering, Oh God, you're near
When I feel alone, Oh God, you're near
At my lowest, Oh God, you're near

Height nor depth nor anything else
Could pull us apart
We are joined as one by your blood
Hope will rise as we become more
Than conquerors through
The one who loved the world
Repeat
x3
Oh God, you never leave my side
Your love will stand firm for all my lifeYou might also
