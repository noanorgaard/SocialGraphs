We go town to town, show to show
You know the real fun starts when the curtains close
Head down the road, to the motel 6
Make a pit stop at the liquor store quick
Pick up a fifth, and some blunts to roll
Lookin' like a parade with all the chicks in tow
Sneak past the lobby, fast like Ricky Bobby
Strait to the pool, skinny dipping party!
After the show is the afterparty
And if you don't know where to go you better ask somebody
Or come with us we got room on the bus
We gonna show you how we get down

Down at the Motel
It's BYOB, so it don't matter if you ain't got a fake I.D
Down at the Motel
This party's for free, and your dude can come as long as he's got weed
Down at the Motel

Down at the Motel

And I don't wanna hear a maybe, just a yes or a no
And you can bring your friend, if she leaves her clothes
Cause we ain't gonna need 'em where we going yo
At the hojo, or the holiday inn

Goose and juice, and a little Patron

After the show is the afterparty
And if you don't know where to go you better ask somebody
Or come with us we got room on the bus

Buzzin' was also the name of Shwayze & Cisco’s MTV2… Read More 
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love

Bang bang, baby shot me in the heart
In the dark with the dart felt the spark when it hit
When we me at the spot it was hot, like this song
Saw the thong, it was on, now it's 8 in the mornin'
I move on like the Greyhound bus
I go, town to town, and I prey on sluts
I gotta go, so scream out your area code
I'm comin' all the way live from the 3-1-O
I gotta whole lot of love, but none like you
You make me wanna stay here in heaven with you
I'll write your name in the sand, put your hand with mine
Come on baby, shoot your gun in the sky

I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (I think she did)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love (yeah)

Bang bang, baby hit me one time
Two days on the road and you're still on my mind
You'd think that I would learn 'cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke so I'm tryna make a hustle outta rhyme
I gotta see the world, one girl at a time
But you're hangin' on my sleeve like I care that you're cryin'
And I do, I'm just tryna play it cool
I got a rep to protect down at the high school
Why you tryna cage me in?
And when I leave we both know you'll be pagin' him
And when I come back, we gon' do it again
I promise we gon' do it again

I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar (do it again)
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (do it again)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love (yeah)

Bang bang, I wanna give you my name
But I'm tryna put some diamonds in my Shwayze chain
Babies change, they start showin' them fangs
Tryna take a ride on this crazy train
Choo choo, what the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city from here to Peru
When I left you, I signed my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed, I'll be back soon
Don't cry, I'll bless you with a text soon
I gotta go, but I'll be back next June
Or July, sparks in the sky
She said, "Boy you crazy"
Nah, I'm Shwayze
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar (do it again)
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (do it again)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love

And I don't know what she was on
Whatever it was, I want some
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in
