All or nothing
Everything or nah
Grey zone is for you to visit and get out of
Reach the bottom of the sky, man
Nothing's gonna happen if you're waiting
We are lonely, at least we share that
In loneliness you gotta make it, gotta unite
Come, I need you closer, ain't you hearing
My inner wish is passing through the feeling

Ey!
Woman chase me need a man
Love me like you hate me man
Me, I am the Elliphant
Waking up the sleepy land
Move me hard, move me soft
Know me scared when me talk the tough
Unlock the man's head, unlock the man's
Unlock the man's up your head
Words are enough to say
Feelings have no song or flesh
It's a whisper from the red
Say want me fall down, me rise up, up, up, up
Say want me clear, love me good!

Huh!
We Viking rule like Elliphant
Step into everything relevant
Don't care if you malevolent
Or you may never land
Well it is clear and evident
We roll in like the president
Look pon the whole street
Then see for the resident
And given them democracy
Axes sharp make sure that thing is permanent
Have to get what I have to get
Me don't care if it is hard to get
I come take and then calculate
Then do something immaculate
Look pon de wall
Check pon de right
Listen to tonda
Look at the light
We came here for all or nothing at all
That is the way of the Viking

Another day another dollar said
Waking up waking out wanna fly away
Who are you baby I never saw you bro
You're like a brush in my eyes

Good vibes the people them want
Play the music ah tell me of Jah
From Jamaica to Sweden to France
People all jump and prance
It's source of life
Take heed from the word of the wise
When I'm down and out and I need some strength
Music can keep me alive

Hey yo yo, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo yo, this type of music keep me groovin'
For life, for life

Feel no pain
Blood run through my veins
Feel so good in my neighborhood
Breathe in breathe out and feel the love G
You may be poor but music is free
A shitty day but then you press play
Music will take you away
