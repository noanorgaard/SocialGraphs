Happy Thanksgiving, sweet potato pies
They was try'na ketchup on it like a plate of fries
Come in dude for the recipe
Uncle Marvin on the couch watching the game next to me
Talking smack, messing with me like an evil twin
It's the Playoffs and we just try to see who's in
Dallas bout to do it yet again
Number 31 breaks a long run and the Eagles win
Thank God, dinner's ready, this stuff is terrific
Family eats, family talks but nothing specific
No religion, no politics
Pudgy lemon at the table doing a couple politrics
I'm a teen now, the streets are mean now
High praise for the waste, you cook and clean wow
Let it be known you get paid but you're not a maid
Nana's here, family's home and I'm not afraid, nah
Beginning and the end of me, before I can even see
The man that I wanted to be, is what you came to know
You taking every step with me, taught me to take the lead
That's why you trusting me, you gone get what you owe
We played in the spring and summer time, learned lessons in the fall
The world is winter, but you was never cold
More than a doer than a talker, but I still live by your words
One day it'll all register, you never get too old
We grow, things change, but you will never go

—  Boy, what you doing up this late? I know you excited about graduating tomorrow
— I don't know, I'm just up, thinking about everything
— This radio show I like is about to come on
— Radio show? What kind of radio show on at 2 o'clock in the morning?
— They call it the World's Famous Supreme Team show and it's about that
