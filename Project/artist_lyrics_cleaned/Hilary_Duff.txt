We could only be a rumor, never be sure (Never be sure)
You could meet me in the backseat (Late night)
A ticket up in first class, mile high (Mile high)

'Cause hey, baby, baby, you got me so, so good, yeah
Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad

Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you, yeah, you, yeah

I don't wanna keep a secret (Let the combo)

I can't wait until the next time (We meet)
Gotta kiss you in the daylight out on the beach (Out on the beach)

You can change your life (If you wanna)
You can change your clothes (If you wanna)
If you change your mind

And your old black hat ('Cause I wanna)
They look good on me
You're never gonna get them back

Laugh it off, let it go and

So yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay?

When you started to ignore me
Do you see a single tear?
It isn't gonna happen here

If it's all been done, what is left to do?
How can you hang up if the line is dead?
If you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead
If you're movin' on, I'm already gone
If the light is off, then it isn't on

At least not today
Not today, not today, 'cause
