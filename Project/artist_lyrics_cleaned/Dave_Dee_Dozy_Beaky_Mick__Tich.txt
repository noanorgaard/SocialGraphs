Girl, you suit me for size
Forget the other guys
You'll never fall
Each time you call

Hold tight
Hold tight
Hold tight

Hold tight, make me feel
What you say is for real
And hold tight, carousel
Girl, you'll soon ring my bell
And hold tight, we will fly

Swinging low, swinging high
We're gonna make the sky
You'll never fall
Each time you call
You might also like
Hold tight
Hold tight
Hold tight


Hold tight, count to three
Gotta stay close by me
And hold tight, sing and shout
Just ride my roundabout
And hold tight, shut your eyes

Girl, you suit me for size
Forget the other guys
You'll never fall
Each time you call

Hold tight
Hold tight
Hold
