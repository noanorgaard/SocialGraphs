Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, "Here, lady, have this"
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette (Good job)
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it (Woman)
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate (Haha)
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up (There you go)
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks (You too)
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream (Uh-huh)
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)

Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

I wanna be a billionaire so fricking 

Let me open up and start again
But there's a safe around my heart
I don't know how to let you in
That's what keeps us apart

And that's why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand
You, you, you
I need you to understand
You, you

Call up the locksmith
Tell him we need him quick
We've got a million keys
None of 'em seem to fit
While you're on the phone
Call up the clocksmith
'Cause I could use some time
Even the slightest bit

Now we all make mistakes
But those mistakes just make us who we are
And not who we choose to be (No)
My faith got misplaced
Somewhere between a superstar (Hey)
And the boy that I used to be (Hey)

I'm just trying to be who you say you are
But who are you?
I'm just trying to be who you say are the stars
And who is cool
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm the dude responsible, hey
But who am I? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Hey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)

They say clothes don't make the man
But I'ma show you how fresh I am
Soon as I pay my water bill
And a couple other bills
They say they got a cure for my smile
Rather for my lack thereof
So they gave me another pill
But it was just that water pill (Raiders!)

You know we all make mistakes
But they just make us insecure
And a little uncomfortable
My faith got misplaced
Between who I was before (Hey)
And the dude you think you know (Hey)

Hey!
See, I can be in the hood sippin' 'gnac with my boys
Or at the keg party with the white boys
At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills
Or at a X party with Vicks and light toys
I guess you can call me a chameleon
I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in
And we all make mistakes
Yeah, I'm a walkin' contradiction
And plus I never listen, ooh
And my faith got misplaced
Somewhere along the lines of (Hey)
Tryin' to make my mind up, yeah (Hey)

Let's go!
Loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water, anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise, touch thumbs, I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours, just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

Hey yo, never let go of me (Ha, never let go)
Hold tight; it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, baby, hold tight)
And I will never let you drown (Never)
Even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey yo, never let go of me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
When I'm sinkin'
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh), oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I said oh)

This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic, but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

Hey yo, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, mama, hold tight)
And I will never let you drown (Nah)
Even if we're going down (Going down)

There's times where like... we find it hard to hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But you let it go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If it comes back, it was meant to be (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If not, just let it be (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
