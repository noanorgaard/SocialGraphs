And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I've been putting out fires all my life
Everybody wants a flame
They don't wanna get burnt
And today is our turn

Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

This world is getting colder
Strangers passing by
Hmm-hmm
No one offers you a shoulder
No one looks you in the eye, ah-ah
Hmm-hmm

Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart

Oh, our bonfire hearts
Mmm, you light the spark

People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart (Two, three, four)
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
Our bonfire hearts
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh-
And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk, and not just speak
Don't buy the promises, cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Ah ooh-

Saw the world turning in my sheets (Ah ooh-)
And once again, I cannot sleep (Ah ooh-)
Walk out the door and up the street (Ah ooh-)
Look at the stars (Ah ooh-)
Look at the stars fall down (Ah ooh-)
And wonder where (Ah ooh-)
Did I go 

Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful

You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with 

As strong as you were, tender you go
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
I know what it means and I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

If she had wings she would fly away
And another day God will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down
Down, down

As strong as you were, tender you go
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
I know what it means and I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang "Here we go again."
And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing "Here we go again."

Wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone

I guess it's over
My memory plays our tune
The same old song

For the life that you lead
You had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the air?
All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be
So no tears, no tears for me

Yeah I've bathed in sunshine
But cherished the fading light
And I heard my heartbeat falter
On a winters night
I loved a woman
But she didn't hear my prayers
So lord, oh lord, I'm yours
No tears
