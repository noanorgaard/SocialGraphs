We've come to sing your praises

Seasons come, then they go
Like the dust on that old dirt road
I try and fight, to take it slow
But the ground keeps moving on its own

So paint the colors of fall
On my heart, so I'll remember
To carry through the pain
And the cold of the winter, oh

When the colors my skin broke my bones and left me bleeding
Through the darkest storm he was there
Now I'm still breathing, ah

Seasons come, then they go
Like the dust on that old dirt road
Try and fight, take it slow
But the ground keeps moving on its own
Yeah the ground keeps moving on its own
Yeah the ground keeps moving on its ownYou might also 
1 ContributorFill This House LyricsHoly spirit, come and fill this house up. Let Your love fall like a fire, consume us, Lord. Come, Lord, Jesus, let Your rain fall on us. In Your presence, come and change our hearts to Yours
We've come to bring glory. We've come to bring faith. We've come to bring honor to Your holy name. We've come to dance. We've come to sing. We've come to encounter Jesus, our king
Holy spirit, come and fill this house up. Let Your love fall like a fire, consume us, Lord. Come, Lord, Jesus, let Your rain fall on us. In Your presence, come and change our hearts to Yours
Living fire, come and overflow to our desire, You and You alone. (x4)
Holy spirit, come and fill this house up. Let Your love fall like a fire, consume us, Lord. Come, Lord, Jesus, let Your rain fall on us. In Your presence, come and change our hearts to YoursYou might also 
1 ContributorTorn Apart LyricsYour blood spilt for me
Once a slave, now I have been set free
I can't help but sing
How your love came down and rescued me
Torn apart you paid my price
The wrath of God was satisfied
I traded sin you gave me life
My hope is found on Jesus Christ
It's my destiny
To walk with you for all eternity
(Chorus)
Your blood spilt for me
Once a slave, now I have been set freeYou might also 

Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams
Coming true and I'm getting to do it with you
And it feels so nice when the people sing along
They're singing along with the banjo

But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you, yeah
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

And one day we might have a big house with nice cars
And fancy clothes and a wife with a big ol' diamond ring
'Cause the people they dancing along, they dancing along
To the mando' and some sort of hip-hop beat

But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
Take it all back just to have you

Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams
