Shawty flip the script
Start sayin' all type of shit out of her lips
I'ma tell ya what I can't stand
When the woman play the role of a man
Talkin' to a nigga like you gotta hold his hand
Treat you like a sped, like he lack to understand
I know you know that I ain't gon' no for the short jackin' all the time
Talkin' to me outta line, broad, you done lost your mind
You gon' fuck round and get me some time

At the point of no return and you made it that way
By the shit that you say every motherfuckin' day
Hope you payin' attention
'Cause I gots to mention
Dissin' me in front of your friends
Tryin' to get a lil' laugh in, joke crackin'
Then I wanna whoop the ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't a man, but you like how he pretend
I'ma be sippin' my Henn' and smokin' my herb

One day I got shot by Cupid
End the mess to this relationship, went stupid
We went from talkin' on the phone too long
To now that is your ass ain't home
You always gone, tellin' me you out with your friends
But I find later on you with your other men
Then, you ain't in it for the dividend
So you get suckin', fuckin', you ain't gettin' nothin'
And that's a damn shame it ended like this
Not I ain't for love for you, bitch
Shoo, fly, don't bother me
Will I get back with her? Probably
Then I though about it, I won't
Do I really want to? I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'm a leave her alone
'Cause I can do bad on my own
That's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad (Huh?)
Sometime I make you sad (Huh?)
Make you want to say "kiss my ass" (Huh)
