RUSSO: So will you lick my balls now?
She pushes him down for round two.
INT. KENNEDY CENTER - LOBBY - NIGHT
A full lobby. OPERA-GOERS dressed to the hilt. A decidedly middle-aged crowd. Gray haired men, matronly women.
We ZERO in on Francis and Claire. People seem to be parting subtly around them - a wide berth. Francis got snubbed for the nomination and everyone knows it.
And OLDER MAN and his wife pass by. The Older Man gives Francis a little double-pat on the shoulder - a consolation. As Francis turns the Older Man and his wife have already moved on. The Older Man gives Francis a slight piteous nod.
From Francis’ POV we see the Older Man whisper into his wife’s ear. She looks back at Francis and Claire. Francis’ gaze shifts to small GROUPING of couples, all stealing glances his way and speaking in hushed tones to one another. The gossip is palpable.
FRANCIS: I need some air.
Claire picks up immediately on his discomfort.
CLAIRE: I’ll see you at the seats.
She disappears through the doors to the auditorium as we follow Francis toward the door.
EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT.
Franics stands outside, scrolling through his blackberry, more to look like he’s busy than because he is.
A cab pulls up. Zoe emerges. She’s in a strapless black dress that hugs every curve. It isn’t very fancy, but it sure gets the job done.
It’s cold. She’s not dressed for the weather. Her headlights are FULLY ON. She turns to her date, BRIAN, early 30s - a typical Capitol Hill climber. He’s getting out of the cab behind her.
ZOE: Gimme your jacket.
He pulls off his jacket and hands it to her. She drapes it over the front of her dress and starts hurrying to main doors. She’s not going to be late for this. As she climbs the steps Francis notices her - more out of instinct than interest. He glances at her ass ever so briefly as she passes. And it’s an exceptional ass. We can tell from the form-fitting fabric that she’s wearing a thong. Once Zoe has passed, Francis turns to his attention back to the blackberry.
INT. KENNEDY CENTER - OPERA - NIGHT.
Francis slips into the booth and takes his seat next to Claire. She doesn’t even look at him, but she reaches out and takes his hand.
The sound of an orchestra tuning. The lights begin to fade. PUSH INTO Francis’ face as the first subtle strands of MUSIC begin to play and we CUT TO:
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT.
Still TIGHT on Francis’ face, the music carrying us into the scene, we PULL BACK to reveal that he’s wearing a headset with a microphone. It’s dim. Blue light flickers in his eyes. As we PULL BACK MORE we see that he’s slumped in a chair, still in his tuxedo (sans tie) with an Xbox controller in his hands. His thumbs and fingers deftly fly back and forth, but  the rest of his body is totally motionless - the calm and focus of a true gamer.
A silhouette enters the frame. It’s Claire. She places her hand gently on Francis’s shoulder. He pulls the headset off. The music cuts out abruptly. From the headphones, we hear the
distant, tinny sound of other online gamers.
Things like a 12 year-old kid taunting: “Imma cap your ass muthafucka” and some redneck retorting: “Suck it dickless”. The lowest of low culture, if you can even call it culture.
FRANCIS: Going to bed?
CLAIRE: Are you coming?
FRANCIS: I’ll be there in a bit.
CLAIRE: Don’t stay up all night.
Claire leans down and kisses him on the forehead. Leaves. Francis puts his headset back on. The online taunts and exclamations resume, full-force.
CUT TO the flat-screen TV. It’s Grand Theft Auto - a complete bloodbath. Francis’ avatar starts blowing people away. Death. Carnage. Glorious vulgarity.
INT. CAB - NIGHT.
The cab pulls up in front of Zoe’s apartment. Zoe and Brian are in the back seat. Zoe’s got Brian’s jacket draped over her. She hands it to Brian.
ZOE: Thanks so much. I’ll call you.
She gives him a platonic peck on the cheek. Opens the door.
BRIAN: Wait...
She turns back.
BRIAN (CONT’D): I thought you had a good time.
ZOE: I did. I’ve never been to the opera before. I loved it.
BRIAN: So...can I come up?
She just looks at him patiently.
BRIAN (CONT’D): I guess that’s a no.
ZOE: You’re really sweet, Brian. I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.
He looks dejected. She’s not going to let this turn into a conversation.
ZOE (CONT’D): Thanks again for inviting me. It was wonderful. (squeezes his hand) Have a good night.
And she’s out of the cab. She throws one last glance back at Brian, a pity glance. Then she’s off. Quick, clean, relatively painless.
INT. ZOE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

She dips the power bar directly into the yogurt (no spoon) as the computer screen jumps to life. Her fingers fly over the keyboard. New window. Email. Password. Inbox. Mostly work stuff. But there’s a new message at the very top:
FROM: Photogangsta@WashingtonHerald.com SUBJECT: Frank Underwood ASS-WHIPPED.
She clicks on the message. A photo fills the screen: Francis checking out Zoe’s ass when she passed him on the steps of the Kennedy Center.
There’s text beneath the photo: If you want em to take you seriously, maybe wear more than G-string?
Command N. New window. Keys punched at lightning speed. Google Search. “Frank Underwood.” Wikipedia comes up. Click.
The words “House Majority Whip” stick out. Zoe considers this for a moment. Clicks back to the other screen. Looks at the photo. Hits reply. Types quickly:
He looks pretty serious to me.
Send. Boom. Done.
INT. UNDERWOOD’S (INNER) OFFICE - MORNING
Underwood is working at his desk. Stamper knocks and peeks his head in the door.
STAMPER: She’s here.
FRANCIS: Show her in.
Stamper disappears. Francis turns to the camera.
FRANCIS: Quite rare for a president’s Chief-of-Staff to climb up the Hill. A gesture of respect, no doubt -- which I appreciate, even if it comes at a cost. Let’s see if I was right about Harold Blythe.
He cranes his head to see her approaching down the hall
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Here she comes - my lesser but necessary half.
Vasquez enters carrying a folder. Francis stands.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Good morning Linda. I appreciate you making the trip over.
VASQUEZ: Of course. My pleasure.
FRANCIS: I assume we’re discussing Education?
VASQUEZ: First things first...
She places the folder on his desk and opens it.
VASQUEZ (CONT’D): The seating chart for the Inauguration. (points) Do these work for you and Claire?
FRANCIS: Wow.
VASQUEZ: Which comes with a complimentary set of tickets to the Red and White Ball.
FRANCIS: Claire will be over the moon.
VASQUEZ: Good, I’m glad.  (closes the folder) So - Education. We have Harry Blythe drafting the legislation.
Francis tosses us a quick glance. His guess was correct.
VASQUEZ (CONT’D): You can imagine the bind that puts us in.
FRANCIS: The bill’s going to be too be two steps to the left of Karl Marx.
VASQUEZ: Education’s been his baby for twenty years. We have to let him take the lead.
FRANCIS: It’ll be hard to drum up much confidence.
VASQUEZ: Which is why I’m here.
FRANCIS: You want me to advise him. Bring him toward the middle.
VASQUEZ (relieved he gets it): We need to this bill to pass smoothly.
FRANCIS: Consider it done, Linda.
VASQUEZ: I know it’s a lot to put on your plate...
FRANCIS: You’ve got 100 days before the honeymoon is over. Anything you  want to put on my plate, feel free.
INT. UNDERWOOD’S (OUTER) OFFICE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
Francis opens the door for Vasquez. As she’s leaving --
VASQUEZ: Keep me posted?
FRANCIS: Let me talk to Blythe. I’ll check in with you later this week.
VASQUEZ: Terrific.
Vasquez leaves. Francis watches her go. He speaks to us --
FRANCIS: She’s wary. I can see it in her eyes. (and now to the camera) Walker’s political capital rises or falls with the success of this Bill. And I need to be at the center of it.
He closes the door, walks back toward his inner office.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Vasquez might not trust me as far as she can throw me. But she  doesn’t have to. If I prove myself indispensable, she can’t afford to throw me very far.
He pops his head into Nancy Kaufberger’s office.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Nancy, set up a call with Harold Blythe.
Continues toward his office.

FRANCIS (CONT’D): Doug?
Stamper pops out from his.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): You have a list for me?
STAMPER: Just finished.
FRANCIS: My office.
INT. FRANCIS’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Francis and Stamper are having a brainstorming session.
STAMPER: Ferguson?
FRANCIS: Too old.
STAMPER: Willis?
FRANCIS: Too stupid.
STAMPER: Boyd?
FRANCIS: Queer.
STAMPER: Really?
Francis gives him a look.
STAMPER (CONT’D): He’s married with two kids.
FRANCIS: Come on.
STAMPER: What about Catherine Durant?
A beat. Francis leans back in his chair.
FRANCIS: Interesting. Catherine Durant.
INT. CWA OFFICE - CLAIRE’S OFFICE - DAY
Claire at her desk. Evelyn sits across from her. Claire peruses a document.
CLAIRE: Can we do any better?
EVELYN: Not without totally crippling our day to day. And we might have to pull out of some of our impact studies.
CLAIRE (hands back the document): Okay, we’ll go with this.
EVELYN: We’re losing some very good people. Folks who have been with us from the beginning...
CLAIRE: This is a charity, but not for our employees. I can’t keep people on just because they’ve been with us a long time.
EVELYN: Do you mind if I ask what we’re going to use the money for?
CLAIRE: An organization I want to bring in - World Water Initiative. They’ve done nice work overseas - Big projects. Very little budget.
EVELYN: Do we need to bring in a new organization? If you want to expand overseas can’t we just -
CLAIRE: Evelyn - you’re the office manager.
EVELYN: I know.
CLAIRE: And you’re an excellent one. But I need you trust that I know what I’m doing here.
EVELYN: I do. I think.
CLAIRE: You have friends - I understand. People you’ve spent years working with. It’s hard to see them go.
Evelyn nods.
CLAIRE (CONT’D): Should I bring somebody else in handle this?
EVELYN: No. I’m good. I can do it.
Evelyn offers a resigned smile.
EXT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - FRONT DOOR
TIGHT on a finger pushing the door bell. A moment later the door opens, revealing Francis. We CUT TO Zoe standing opposite, Steve right beside her.
STEVE: Sir, I’m sorry to bother you. This woman said you were expecting her.
FRANCIS: Who are you?
ZOE: My name is Zoe Barnes. I’m a reporter at the Washington Herald.
FRANCIS: It’s almost ten at night. This is my home. I don’t -
ZOE: We’re part of a mutual appreciation club.
She holds out her phone. We can’t see what’s on it, but Francis can. He smiles.
FRANCIS: You’re a fan of the opera.
ZOE: More for the people watching than the music. Same as you.
Francis is impressed by her brassiness.
FRANCIS (opens the door wider): Come in, Ms. Barnes.
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Francis pours drinks from the liquor cabinet. Hands one to Zoe, then sits across from her. Zoe takes a sip.
ZOE: It’s strong.
FRANCIS: You like it weak?
ZOE: No - the stronger the better.
She unwraps her scarf, revealing some impressive cleavage Francis takes a quick glance, then finds her eyes again.
ZOE (CONT’D): There’s no harm in looking.
FRANCIS: That’s a cheap ploy, Ms. Barnes.
ZOE: Cheap but effective.
FRANCIS: If your goal is to distract me - which you haven’t.
ZOE: I don’t want you distracted - I want you focused
FRANCIS: You certainly have my undivided attention.
ZOE: Good, then I’ll get straight to the point...
FRANCIS (amused): Foreplay is over?
ZOE: I read somewhere that JFK never lasted more than three minutes.
FRANCIS: The point being?
ZOE: That time is precious. Powerful people don’t have the luxury of foreplay.
He smiles, eyes narrowing.
FRANCIS: Why are you here Ms. Barnes?
ZOE: Because I need somebody I can trust, and someone who trusts me.
FRANCIS: You’re in the wrong zip code for that.
ZOE: Maybe trust isn’t the right word. An arrangement perhaps.
FRANCIS: As in...
ZOE: You confide in me, to the extent that you’re comfortable...
FRANCIS: And in return...
ZOE: I protect your identity and print what you tell me. I serve you. I communicate what you can’t publicly say yourself.
FRANCIS: What makes you think I don’t already have such an arrangement with one of your colleagues?
ZOE: Because if you did, you wouldn’t have let me in the door.
Francis smiles. He’s enjoying the repartee.
FRANCIS: I’ve had a very long, very successful career avoiding this sort of intrigue with the press. I don’t see any particular advantage in starting now.
ZOE: Is there any disadvantage?
FRANCIS: Sloppiness, for one.
ZOE: I promise you absolute discretion.
FRANCIS: So we are talking about trust.
ZOE: Use whatever word you like. I don’t care.
FRANCIS: Words matter very much, Ms. Barnes. You should care more, given your  profession.
ZOE: Then yes, your trust. Because if I were to betray it I stand far less of a chance surviving the consequences.
FRANCIS: Metro is killing you, huh?
She looks at him, impressed he knows this.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Don’t be flattered that I’m familiar with your work. I read everything.
ZOE: I don’t doubt it. And yes, Metro is killing me.
FRANCIS (considers for a moment): How exactly can I help you?
ZOE: The Administration’s legislative agenda.
FRANCIS: I see.
ZOE: You must know.
FRANCIS: I may.
ZOE: Immigration is too controversial. Tax-reform isn’t sexy enough. I’m thinking Education.
FRANCIS: You very well might think that. I couldn’t possibly comment.
ZOE: All I need is a nod or a wink.
FRANCIS: It’s late Ms. Barnes, and it’s been a long day.
ZOE: Can we speak again?
FRANCIS: A prudent man never makes a rash decision unless forced by necessity. And my only necessity at the moment is a pillow beneath my head. I hope you’ll understand if I’d prefer to sleep on all of this.
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
Francis helps Zoe put her coat on. Steve is in the foyer with them. Zoe hands Francis a card.
ZOE: My cell phone’s on the back. Personal, not work.
Francis pockets the card without looking at it.
FRANCIS (to Steve): Did you put Ms. Barnes in the visitors leger?
STEVE: Not yet.
FRANCIS: Don’t. (to Zoe) Needless to say...
ZOE: Needless. I get it.
Francis smiles. She smiles back. His desire to make her visit “disappear” is a good sign. He opens the door for her. Claire is coming up the steps.
CLAIRE: Oh...hello...
FRANCIS: Claire, this is Ms. Zoe Barnes, from the Washington Herald.
ZOE: Very nice to meet you Mrs. Underwood.
They shake hands. Claire offers a polite smile.
FRANCIS (to Zoe): Drive safe. There’s lots of ice on the road.
ZOE: I will. Goodnight. And thank you.
Francis and Claire watch Zoe walk off.
CLAIRE: A reporter?
FRANCIS: A hungry reporter.
CLAIRE: Aren’t they all?
EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - LATE AT NIGHT
A BMW slows to a halt by the curb with a POLICE CAR slowing to a stop behind it, lights flashing.
CUT TO: A POLICE OFFICER ambles up to the stopped BMW and aims a flashlight at the driver. It’s Russo. He looks wasted.
POLICE OFFICER: License and registration.
RUSSO: The glove compartment sweetheart.
We see that there’s a CALL-GIRL in the passenger seat. She gets the registration out of the glove compartment while Russo pulls out his license and hands it to the cop.
RUSSO (CONT’D): Here you go.
POLICE OFFICER: This isn’t your license. It’s a Starbucks card.
RUSSO: Oh...sorry about that.
POLICE OFFICER: Sir - have you been drinking?
RUSSO: No, I don’t drink coffee at this hour.
POLICE OFFICER (not amused): I’m going to need you to step out of the car.
RUSSO: If I was speeding just write me a ticket and I’ll -
POLICE OFFICER: Sir, out of the car. Right now.
RUSSO: Alright listen, I don’t want to sound like a prick, but I’m a member of Congress...
POLICE OFFICER: I don’t care if you’re the King of China.
RUSSO: China doesn’t have a King. It’s a communist oligwock - ola - communist oligarchy. Man, that’s hard to say.
The cop opens the door.
POLICE OFFICER: Let’s go. Out. (to the Call-Girl) You too.
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - LATER
The phone rings. Francis groggily answers it.
FRANCIS: Hello...?
Listens for a second. Sits up, suddenly alert.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Good - let’s think this through for a second...

The door swings open, jangling a bell. In walks D.C. Police Commissioner BARNEY HULL - a square-jawed career law enforcer. He glances around, doesn’t see who he’s looking  for. Takes a seat in one of the booths. A figure slowly spins around on one of the stools at the  counters and faces Hull. It’s Stamper.
STAMPER: Mind if I join you?
Hull looks at him, perplexed. Stamper gets off the booth and slides into the booth across from Hull.
INT. CHRISTINA’S CAR - LATE MORNING
Christina is driving, Russo’s riding shotgun.
RUSSO: It was just a few drinks.
CHRISTINA: It was enough to get pulled over.
RUSSO: But I was in control. I wasn’t drunk drunk.
CHRISTINA: Were you alone?
RUSSO: Yes.
CHRISTINA: Say it to my face.
RUSSO: Watch the road.
CHRISTINA: Say it to my face!
RUSSO: Yes - I was alone!
CHRISTINA: You can’t keep doing this Peter. It’s gonna catch up with you.
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Claire picks up two fresh cups of coffee from the espresso machine. Meanwhile Francis finishes slicing an apple, places half the slices on one plate, half on another. They meet at  the kitchen table - Claire with the coffee, Francis with the apple. Sit down. Their morning routine.
CLAIRE: Do you think we can arrange two more at our table for the Red and White Ball?
FRANCIS: For whom?
CLAIRE: The Holburns.
FRANCIS: Why on earth would we want them there?
CLAIRE: I’m going to need her money for the CWA at some point.
FRANCIS: The expansion?
CLAIRE: The staff cuts will only get us halfway there. We’ll need to fund new projects.
FRANCIS: I’ll talk to Vasquez.
A beat.
CLAIRE (checking in): How’re we doing?
FRANCIS: Good.
CLAIRE: Just good?
FRANCIS: Progress. Irons in the fire.
CLAIRE (smiles): I like irons. But I love fire.
He downs his espresso. Stands. Gives her a peck on the forehead. And he’s out the door.
INT. BLYTHE’S OFFICE - DAY
Francis holds up a document as HAROLD BLYTHE looks on.
FRANCIS (holding up the document): This is the only hard copy?
BLYTHE: Yes.
Francis goes over to the shredder, starts feeding in pages.
BLYTHE (CONT’D): What are you...
Francis has put too many pages in. The shredder jams. He yanks out the half devoured sheets and tosses them in the waste basket with the rest of the 600 page document.
FRANCIS: The bill is garbage, Harry, and you know it. You’ve wasted your time and mine. I’m not happy.
BLYTHE: I’m sorry Frank...
FRANCIS: I don’t want apologies, I want a passable bill. Tax increases? The ban on vouchers? A Federal Oversight Commission? How am I supposed to work with that? You
have to help me help you.
BLYTHE: I’ll rewrite it.
FRANCIS: By the inauguration.
BLYTHE: If you want something from scratch that’s going to be -
FRANCIS: You have less than a week.
BLYTHE: That was years worth of work.
FRANCIS: Then get me a short-form draft. Get me something I can put your name on. We can flesh out the long-form later.
Francis points to the waste basket
FRANCIS (CONT’D): That version is dead. Erase every copy on every computer.
Blythe nods
FRANCIS (as he goes): Call me if you need anything.
And Francis is out the door. We follow him. He turns to us.
FRANK: (to tthe camera): Busy work for poor old Blythe. Eventually I’ll have to re-write the bill myself. Not because I care what’s in it. I only care about where it gets me. And if it gets me rubbing shoulders with Walker again, it’s served its purpose. But to do that I need a bill I can pass. Ideology is for standing still on a soapbox. I never stand still. I want momentum.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
TIGHT on the door. A knock. A moment later the door opens, revealing the CALL-GIRL we saw with Russo the night before. She’s wearing a long overcoat and heels. CUT TO to Stamper.
STAMPER: Come on in.
The Call-Girl takes a look around the room, impressed. She unzips her overcoat. Let’s it fall to the ground. She’s only wearing panties underneath. Stamper pulls an enormous wad out of his jacket pocket. Tosses it to her. She starts to flip through the wad.
STAMPER (CONT’D): Ten thousand dollars. What will that get me?
She eyes him, a little frightened.
CALL-GIRL: I mean I’m kinky, but I don’t know if I’m the girl you’re looking for.
STAMPER: Oh you’re definitely the girl I’m looking for.
CALL-GIRL (stands): This doesn’t feel right...
STAMPER: All I want for that money is your silence.
CALL-GIRL: My silence...?
STAMPER: The guy you were with last night, the one who was arrested. Do you  know who he was?
CALL-GIRL: You mean the Congressman?
STAMPER: There was no Congressman. There was no arrest. None of it exists.  All that exists is the money you’re holding. You understand?
CALL-GIRL: Yeah.
STAMPER: Good.
Stamper pulls out some more money from his jacket. Folds it.
STAMPER (CONT’D): Open your mouth.
She does, he gently slides the bills between her teeth.
STAMPER (CONT’D): Here’s four hundred more. This last bit is for me.
He takes off his jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt.
INT. FRANCIS’S (INNER) OFFICE - LATE MORNING
Francis sits across from CATHERINE DURANT (early 50s), another conservative Democrat from the South.
DURANT: Secretary of State?
FRANCIS: That’s right.
DURANT (puzzled): Walker just nominated Kern.
FRANCIS: It’s a long road to confirmation.
DURANT: Kern is a boy scout.
FRANCIS: No one’s a boy scout. Not even boy scouts.
Durant is intrigued by Francis’s tone. She presses.
DURANT: What do you have?
FRANCIS: Absolutely nothing.
DURANT: So what are we talking about here?
FRANCIS: I’m just asking a simple question - does the job interest you?
DURANT: Wouldn’t you want it for yourself?
FRANCIS: I turned it down.
DURANT: Really? I heard that Walker passed you over.
FRANCIS: I’ve let that story ride so he could save face. I haven’t spent twenty years in Congress to toss it aside for a four-year cabinet post.
DURANT: So why do you want Kern gone?
FRANCIS: I want him gone because he’s a pretty face with an empty skull. The Foreign Relations Committee needs a Secretary I can work with. Somebody brilliant. Somebody  tough. Somebody who isn’t afraid to stand up to Walker when he’s wrong. We need you Catherine.
DURANT (slight beat): Let’s assume I’m interested...
FRANCIS: I don’t want to assume - I want to know.
INT. RAYBURN BLDG PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
A Black SUV rounds a corner on the bottom floor of the garage, pulls into an empty spot. We can see that Steve is driving. The back door opens. Stamper gets out. He heads  toward a set of dumpsters in the far corner. Looks around. Sees no one. Opens the lid to one of the dumpsters.
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
ZOE is seated at her desk, looking miserable - trapped, under appreciated, creativity stifled. She’s got her land line phone to one ear and is taking notes she clearly doesn’t give a rat’s ass about.
ZOE: Uh-huh...uh-huh...
Her cell phone vibrates. She glances at it. “Unknown Number.”
ZOE: (into the land line): Hold on.
She answers the cell phone.
ZOE: Zoe Barnes.
After a beat she stiffens, suddenly alert.
ZOE (CONT’D): Yes, anywhere you want. (listens) On my way.
She ends the call.
ZOE (CONT’D) (into the land line): I’ll call you back.
She hastily grabs her purse and coat, heads for the elevator.
INT. NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY
Francis and Zoe sit side by side on a bench in front of a Thomas Eakins painting. It depicts two rowers in a skull.
FRANCIS: Do the math, Ms. Barnes.
ZOE: He needs a bill...
FRANCIS: Sponsored by?
ZOE: Somebody with legitimacy...
Zoe thinks for a moment, then shakes her head.
ZOE (CONT’D): But the person with the most experience...
FRANCIS (finishing her thought): Harold Blythe.
ZOE: ...is an old school tax and spend Democrat. Walker ran as a moderate. He’s almost Republican.
FRANCIS: Exactly, which is why he needs me.
ZOE: To steer the bill to the center.
FRANCIS: You were right about why Walker kept me in Congress.
ZOE: Do you think Blythe would talk to me?
FRANCIS: Be smarter than that. He can’t speak to the press about this.
ZOE: Maybe somebody in his office, if I butter them up. All I need is a few crumbs.
Francis flips open a brief case. Pulls out a bulky manila envelop and places it in Zoe’s lap.
FRANCIS: How about a five-course dinner?
She peeks inside the envelope.
ZOE: Is this what I think it is?
Francis points to the painting.
FRANCIS: I just love this painting, don’t you?
Zoe looks up. TIGHT on the two rowers in the painting. Then BACK TO the pair on the bench. Francis turns to Zoe.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): We’re in the same boat now, Zoe. Take care not to tip it over. If you do, I can only save one of us from drowning.
INT. ZOE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
Zoe in her cramped, hopelessly messy apartment. She’s flipping through Blythe’s original draft. Making notes. Utterly focused. She has something no one else on the planet has. Her cell phone rings. She presses ignore without even looking at the number. A moment later it rings again. She presses ignore. Nothing is going to distract her.
INT. BLAIR HOUSE - VASQUEZ’S OFFICE - DAY
Francis and Vasquez across a desk from one another.
VASQUEZ: We need a passable bill.
FRANCIS: And you’ll have one.
VASQUEZ: Before the inauguration.
FRANCIS: I didn’t choose Harold Blythe. You did. And that’s fine. I had to send him back to the starting gates, but I can work with him. You don’t have to micro-manage this, Linda.
VASQUEZ: The President-Elect is concerned.
FRANCIS: He shouldn’t be. And you shouldn’t either. You’re asking me to work a miracle. I understand that. And I’m telling you - I’ll work the miracle.
VASQUEZ: Alright, Frank...
FRANCIS: I have a favor to ask, though.Can you fit two more guests at our table? For the Red and White Ball?
VASQUEZ: Of course. I can make that happen.
INT. FRANCIS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Francis shuts the door as Russo takes a seat.
FRANCIS: Drink?
RUSSO: Sure...what do you got?
FRANCIS: Whiskey. Bush Mills.
RUSSO: If you’re offering.
As Francis pours him a drink.
FRANCIS: How are things in the city of brotherly love?
RUSSO: We’re getting by.
FRANCIS: Good, good.
Francis hands him the drink.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): So it seems you’ve been a bit...irresponsible.
RUSSO: What...?
FRANCIS: Don’t play dumb with me Peter. Save it for the House Ethics Committee.
Russo freezes - a deer caught in headlights.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Drink up, you could use some courage right now.
RUSSO: You’re not having any?
FRANCIS: It’s a bit early in the day for me.
Russo sets his drink down.
RUSSO: Is this about last night?
Francis simply stares at him. A stare which says “yes.”
RUSSO (CONT’D): How do you know about that?
FRANCIS: Because it’s my job to know.
RUSSO: Look - they let me off. There’s no charges. It’s all taken care of.
FRANCIS: Honestly Peter, do you really think these things take care of themselves?
Russo suddenly realizes Francis was behind his release.
RUSSO: It was just that once, Frank. I swear to God.
FRANCIS: Then you must hold God in very low esteem, because we both know that’s  a lie. Drunk driving, prostitutes, cocaine - you’ve got quite a long list of hobbies. I’m surprised you  can find the time to represent your constituents. What I should really have done is hang you out to dry. But then you’d be of no use to me, would you?
RUSSO: What is it that you want?
FRANCIS: Your absolute, unquestioning loyalty.
RUSSO (after a beat): Anything. You name it, Frank.
FRANCIS: Not now - but soon. There will be no shortage of things you’ll be able to do for me.
INT. WASHINGTON HERALD - NEWSROOM - AFTERNOON
Zoe makes a B-line for Lucas’s office. As she barges in…
ZOE: Where have you been? I’ve been calling you.
LUCAS: Everybody’s working double-time on the Inauguration and you decide to just up and disapp --
She plops a large ream of paper on his desk. He picks it up, starts to flip through.
LUCAS (CONT’D): Where did you get this?
ZOE: Wrong question. The right question is how quickly can we get it up on the site?
LUCAS: This is page one. I have to run it past Bob.
ZOE: Then let’s run it past Bob.
INT. WASHINGTON HERALD - HAMMERSCHMIDT’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Hammerschmidt, Zoe and Lucas - serious shit going down.
HAMMERSCHMIDT (to Lucas): Get legal on this - make sure we’re not breaking any laws. And I want a litigation assessment. (to Zoe) You won’t tell me your source?
ZOE: I can’t do that.
HAMMERSCHMIDT: Fine. But if legal -
ZOE: I understand. How long do you think that will take? We should get this online right away.
HAMMERSCHMIDT: I’m not just going to scan a 600 page document and put it up before  we’ve gone through every --
ZOE: I did that already.
HAMMERSCHMIDT: You read the whole thing?
ZOE: Cover to cover. I’ve got excerpts. Analysis. Three thousand words ready for editing.
Hammerschmidt glances at Lucas. They’re impressed.
HAMMERSCHMIDT (to Lucas); You start going over that. And let’s get the online staff pitching in, working on graphs, charts, the whole nine yards. (opens door, calls out) Janine! (to Zoe) What’s the angle, five words or less?
ZOE: Far left of center.
HAMMERSCHMIDT: How far?
ZOE: Very.
HAMMERSCHMIDT: Enough to put Walker on his heels?
ZOE: Forget his heels. This will put him on his ass.
Janine enters. She doesn’t see Zoe in the corner.
HAMMERSCHMIDT (to Janine): We’ve got a draft of the administration’s Education Bill.  You’re going to work with Zoe, do background copy.
JANINE (incredulous): Zoe Barnes?
HAMMERSCHMIDT: That’s right. Whatever she needs.
Hammerschmidt nods in Zoe’s direction. Janine sees Zoe for the first time.
JANINE (as if it’s disgusting): Share a byline with her?
HAMMERSCMIDT: No sharing. The byline is Zoe’s.
JANINE: But she’s Metro. I’m your chief political correspondent...
HAMMERSCHMIDT: Then you should’ve brought in the story yourself.  (to Lucas) Zoe gets the byline. Janine gets assisted credit.
JANINE: Assisted? Come on. You can’t -
HAMMERSCHMIDT: Go. We’ve got 18 hours before tomorrow’s print deadline.
Janine glares at Zoe.
ZOE (to Janine, triumphant): I’ll see you at my desk.
Zoe walks out. Janine reluctantly follows.
EXT. THE MALL - MORNING
A WIDE PAN of massive crowds gathered for the Inauguration Ceremony on a crystal clear, January morning.
FRANCIS (V.O.): Power is like real estate. It’s all about location, location, location.
CUT TO the rostrum on the Capitol steps. Walker has his hand raised as CHIEF JUSTICE conducts the oath of office.
FRANCIS (V.O.): The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value.
We ZOOM IN on Francis and Claire sitting in the first row behind the lectern.
FRANCIS (V.O.): A hundred years from now, when people watch this footage, who will they see smiling just at the edge of the frame?
Francis gives a little wave to the camera.
CHIEF JUSTICE: So help you God.
WALKER: So help me God.
EXT. THE ROSTRUM - TEN MINUTES LATER
TIGHT on Walker in the midst of his Inaugural Address.
WALKER: ...Today is not simply about the next four years. It’s about the next four decades. You’ve placed your faith in me, and I, in turn, choose to place that faith in our children. Our children are the key to this nation’s future, and that’s why the first order of business for this administration will be a comprehensive Education Reform Bill to properly fix, finance and  strengthen our nation’s schools.
Huge cheers from the audience. QUICK CUT TO Francis, clapping vigorously, staring right at us.
INT. RED AND WHITE BALL - NIGHT
A huge reception hall decorated to the hilt. The mood is festive. Francis and Claire are seated next to Charles and Felicity Holburn at the Vice-President’s table.
FELICITY (leaning into Claire): It was so nice of you to make this possible. When you called and -
CLAIRE: Not another word.
SHIFT TO Secretary of State nominee Michael Kern.
KERN: ...”Your dog must be a genius,” the guy says. “Nah,” says the other guy, “He’s pretty stupid. Every time he’s got a good hand he sniffs his ass.”
Everyone at the table laughs at the punch line, Kern most of all. Francis forces a laugh. Claire leans into Francis.
CLAIRE: Go do your thing.
He squeezes her hand. Gets up. CUT TO Blythe standing awkwardly alone eating a crab cake at the hors d’oeuvres table. Francis approaches.
FRANCIS: Maestro, I’ve been looking all over for you.
Blythe fumbles with the crab cake, accidently spilling it on his lapel.
BLYTHE: Shit.
In an instant Francis has grabbed a napkin and begins dabbing the stain.
BLYTHE (CONT’D): Oh thanks...
FRANCIS: Truly outstanding work on the new draft. You’re going to make history with that bill Harry.
BLYTHE: Thanks for all your help Frank. Couldn’t have done it without you.
Out of the corner of his eye, Francis spots Catherine Durant near the dance floor.
FRANCIS: Catherine! (to Blythe) Excuse me Harry.
And Francis glides over to Catherine.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Don’t you look stunning.
DURANT: We Southern girls clean up well when you get us out of the trailer park and into some Vera Wang.
FRANCIS: And we Southern boys may be slow with our words, but we’re fast on our feet.
He half bows, takes her hand and kisses it.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): May I have the honor?
DURANT: You most certainly may.
He leads her onto the dance floor and they waltz beautifully.
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - EARLY MORNING
The streets are empty. Sanitation workers sweep up the ticker tape from the previous day’s celebration. Police crews load barricades into flatbed trucks.
EXT. FREDDY’S BBQ JOINT - EARLY MORNING
It’s a bitterly cold, bright sunny day. Francis arrives at the restaurant with a newspaper tucked under his arm. FREDDY - the husky African American proprietor - sees him approaching and opens the door for him.
FREDDY: Mornin’ Frank.
FRANCIS: Morning Freddy. How are you?
FREDDY: Can’t kick. Come on in.
FRANCIS: Actually, would you mind setting up a table for me outside?
FREDDY: Outside? It’s freezing.
FRANCIS: I’ll be fine. A little cold never hurt anyone.
Freddy nods and heads inside. Francis turns to the camera.
FRANCIS (CONT’D); My one guilty pleasure is a good racks of ribs. Even at 7:30 in the  morning. I have the whole place to myself. Freddy opens up just for me...
CUT TO: Francis at a table, breath condensing in the cold air.
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Where I grew up in South Carolina nobody had two pennies to rub  together. A rack of ribs was a luxury, like Christmas in July. I’ve had a weakness for them ever since.
Freddy comes outside with a steaming plate of ribs. Places them before Francis. Before digging in, Francis glances at the newspaper he brought with him. Zoe’s breaking story, detailing the contents of the leaked Education Bill, occupies a huge swath of the front page. The headline reads:
EDUCATION BILL FAR LEFT OF CENTER
We PAN DOWN to see Zoe’s byline in bold above the article.
QUICK MONTAGE
-- Blythe in his office staring at the article on his computer. Complete horror.
-- Vasquez in the back of an SUV scrolling through her blackberry in even more horror.
-- Zoe, Lucas and Hammerschmidt gathered around a computer where a TECH GUY is monitoring a graph.
TECH GUY: The web traffic is crazy.
-- Janine watching Zoe, Hammer and Lucas from a distance, eyes narrowed - jealous.
-- A COP CAR with its lights flashing beside a dented BLUE TOYOTA CAMRY - the same car that hit the dog in the opening scene. Two COPS cuffing the mangy 20 year-old CULPRIT.
EXT. FREDDY’S BBQ JOINT - MORNING
Francis’ plate is empty. He wipes his hands and dabs his mouth with a napkin. Freddy starts to clear Francis’s plate.
FREDDY: You want seconds?
FRANCIS: I better not.
Freddy starts off. Scarcely a moment later…
FRANCIS (CONT’D): Actually, yes. I’m feeling hungry today.
Freddy goes inside. Francis stares right at us, piercingly.
FRANCIS (CONT’D) (to the camera): There are two kinds of pain, but only one kind of pleasure - total, unstoppable, undeniable victory. (leans toward us) The minister was wrong about defeat. I wasn’t put on this planet to endure. I was put on this planet to win.
He closes his eyes again and leans back. Basks in the sun and exhales a long, deep breath into the cold air. The serenity is shattered by sudden, thumping ROCK MUSIC. Black out.
