I've showed you countless numbers of times that
I can do it (I can do it)
So for one time in your whole life just
Let me try it (Let me try it)

I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna let go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

What's the harm
To have a little fun?
Been so uptight
I don't mean to fight
I'm just, stay and watch

I see stars, you just see holes in the sky
You tell me you see it too, but I know that's a lie
I dream up into the night, just see the darkness of your eyes
I won't let you change me tonight
