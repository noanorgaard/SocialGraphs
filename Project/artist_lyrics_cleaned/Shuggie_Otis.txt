Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh, If you try to ask, "Is it cool?"
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be

With my baby
I am free
Flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays
I sit in for a few

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
