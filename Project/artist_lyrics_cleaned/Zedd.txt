Make them dance, just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go

I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

High on words we almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same achilles heels

Make them dance, just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go, oh

1 ContributorClarity (Brillz Remix) Lyrics
High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

Why, why are you my clarity?

Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

And ignite
Ignite

I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

Honey, it's rainin' tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me you're covered tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

I want you to know that it's our time
