And now you, you can call me up
And now you, you can call me up

How many days in
I never knew how
You could wait until the moment
That you have any doubt
Can't let you go on talking
And you can talk back
'Cause never any limits
The way you goin'
Turn up and I listen
Through everything you said
I know there's a limit
I looked into your head
So I continue calling
And there was no way back
Can listen to every minute
There way no way back now

There was never any limit
Never any power
Stand up then I listen
Never knew how
You could call me in the middle
Of everything that's been
Stand up and I listen
To you and I begin

And now you, you can call me up (Waited a long time to tell you)

'Cause I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I will never take back
The words that I said then
I always knew I'd come back to you
Even in the meantime
I will always stand by
A mirror on the shelf

America
Pulled me out of the shadow
Pushed me up against tomorrow
Dressed me up in your sorrow
And I don’t want to ruin your paradise
Screaming through your tunnels in the dead of night
Driving around and around and around

But we can't pretend that times don't change
All the pieces have been rearranged

Innocent hearts right in the middle of it
Innocent hearts, sign and deliver
You want to believe it? You'll have to go slow
Innocent hearts, time is a ticking
But we're making a start, look in the mirror
The lines getting deeper, but what do you know?

Do you remember the way it felt
When I was walking in the middle of you, now?
I'll stop pretending that I played it nice
Do you remember now, feeling it twice?

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop

Never gonna stop
Until we break it

Dancing on glass

We all have our secrets our secrets, no
Our violence mistaken for silence, oh

You'd better believe it's never been easier
And we're never gonna stop until it's broken
