I really gotta have you
'Cause what my body feels I can't take away
And you, you're so exciting
That you take my breath away

So get ready
And let me love you
I've got the answer
Right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
I wanna win girl, so let me know what's on your mind

(I'm curious) About your lovin'
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind
(I'm curious) About your lovin', girl

We should get it together
'Cause right now, girl, this feeling's strong
And I'm anticipating
I wanna know what turns you on
