My girl's got a little schtick
Keep you cooped up in the kitchen while you feed the kid
Keep you waitin' in the winter while the tension ticks
You might also likeMy girl got a limousine
Got a full-time job just to keep it clean
Got a speaker in the trunk, you know it weighs a ton
(You think I'm the negative one!)

Late nights and black Israelites
White women singin' under diner lights
Baseball bats that never hit home runs
Late nights and black Israelites
White women singin' under diner lights
Baseball bats that never hit home runs
I got a baseball bat, never hit home runs
My girl got a minimum
Leave it stuck right there 'til the number comes
Leave a smooth operator lookin' like a bum
My girl's got a city to run
Got the key to the kingdom where the money's from
Never seen the color yellow, never seen the sun
