(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you

Part of me is faking
Faking it all just for fun
Part of me is breaking
Breaking apart when you come

(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you (Oh)
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you

I feel my bones, I feel my bones
I feel my bones crack in your arms
And I can't tell you what you want
But I'll tell you all the things I like
And if I keep myself away
Would you chase in the dead of night?
And I can't be the girl you want
But I can be the thing you throw away
Throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away
Throw away, throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away

(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you (Oh)
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to 

Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Just tell me that I'm wrong
So wrong

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feelin' whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on comin' back
I keep lettin' you in

Fall asleep right next to me

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good
