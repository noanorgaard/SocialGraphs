But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's all right (That's all right)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I
Am, oh, who am I? Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I see
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on, oh, come on
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breakin' for my sister
And the con that she called "love"
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (All right, come on)
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen, no
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh
For the best, you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, 

This growin' old is gettin' old, I often find myself here thinkin'
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinkin'
And it's crazy here without you, I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way, you say it's all up in the stars

Well, some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh god, I miss her so much

And there are people on the street, they're comin' up to me
And they're tellin' me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall to get right back up, back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much?

I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby

And I'd be sayin' that you
You're always holdin' onto stars

'Cause no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I have faded in the dark

That no one's gonna save us?

Ooh, come on girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, come on girl

I just need a helpin' hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true, it came true
It never came true

Oh, and you
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
'Cause no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and you
You're always holdin' onto stars
I think they're better from afar
Because no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I am fadin' in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me, don't you wish on me, why can't you see that
No one's gonna save us? No one's gonna save us, no one's gonna save me now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No one's gonna save us
Who we are, who we are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are
You're always holdin' onto stars

I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die
I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die

I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can't help but back up when I think of what happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live, but what you're callin' a sin isn't up to them
After all, after all I thought we were all your children

But I will die for my own sins, thanks a lot
We will rise up ourselves, thanks for nothing at all
So up off the ground, our forefathers are nothing but dust now

I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die
I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die

Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over 25 and I can't make a name for myself, some nights I break down and cry
I'm lucky that my father's still alive
He's been fightin' all his life and if this is all I've ever known, then may his soul live on forever
In my song

I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die
I'll put one foot in front of the other one
I don't need a new love or a new life, just a better place to die

In front of the other one, in front of the other one
Just a better place to 

So I call your name
Cross my fingers, uncross the others
Hesitate, oh, I don't think straight
With nothing to prove
I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I'll stay until the weekend
You can take all the things
The boxes and rings and get going
'Cause I've been waiting for

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down

So I call (I call) you out (Out baby)
Just to feel a little bit better about myself (He does)
I do (You do), baby
I do, I do, I do (Yeah, we really get it, yeah, we know you do)
Until their lips start to move and their friends talk music
I'll say, "I've never heard the tune"
But I have, I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you
Every single night ends up the same
I don't say much at all but I bring up your name
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out

And then this one doesn't wanna admit she's falling in love
Oh, c'mon, oh, c'mon, what's a boy to do?
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things, they define you and me
Everything we've become
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
And you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
But not you, I feel your faith is destroying the world
And then this one, never really understood
The eighties is over and done
Oh, c'mon, what's a boy to do?
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
Say all the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phones
Show me how no one's ever gonna stop us now


'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

(No one's ever gonna stop us now)

I finished kissin' my death, so now I head back up the steps
Thinkin' about where I been; I mean, the sun was never like this
I wanna feel with the season, I guess it makes sense
'Cause my life's become as vapid as a night out in Los Angeles
And I just wanna stay in bed

And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

Or go on, go on, go on, if you were thinkin' that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packin' up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once, I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packin' up my stuff?

She got enough on her mind that she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air, so now she rollin' down the window
Never been one to hold on, but I need a last breath
So I ask if she remembers when she used to come and visit, man
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong
