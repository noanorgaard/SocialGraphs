Remember the first time we met?
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hoping you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again

(That girl) like something off a poster
(That girl) is a dime they say
(That girl) is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn'
Girl, you really changed my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

1 ContributorIsland girl (feat. diction) LyricsYeah, hahahaha... whooooo, s***!
(aight)
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
Ayo... This is my love song... it goes like this
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinning
You're beginin' to think women
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
You might also like'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them "no"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube
17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as f*** spillin' guts to you
We just met
But I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "yo, what the f*** we do?"
I gotta go *****
You know I have stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But f*** it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
S***'s sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
S***, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of the s*** is going to mean s*** where we're going
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like s*** every morning
But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more s*** that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed
Drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of 

See how we used to be a team
Running the streets, yeah we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider, I was your provider
Now we separated in two

Oh, and baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it no, no
I don't want it no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo, solo

You was the beat onto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airwaves
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, you did

Oh, and baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

Then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard ain't nothing like a Cali girl
But you better have a lot of cash

And no matter where I go, I gotta let 'em know

Tryna find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back
Got a knack for them girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips (Uh-huh)
Just make sure you leave my heart how you found it (Yeah)
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it (Uh-huh)
