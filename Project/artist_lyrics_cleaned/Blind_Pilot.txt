So this was our song
This was our song
I still see the lights
I can see them
And the crisscross
Of what is true, won't get to us
Cause you know me
I could not give up on you
And the fog of what is right
Won't cover us
Cause you know me
I could not give up a fight
Soil and six feet under
(Crisscross of what is true, won't get to us)
Kept just like we were
(Cause you know me, I could not give up on you)
Before you knew you'd know me
(Wouldn't feel true)
And you know me
Blooming up from the ground
(And the fog of what is right won't cover us)
3 rounds and a sound
(Cause you know me, I could not give up a fight)
Like whispering 'you know me
(Wouldn't feel right)
You know 

One half moon sleeping by the creeks
And a woman put me under her barn roof for a week
I knew her voice before she spake
I saw a grave dug by a preacher, just to see what it would make

So hold high how faint your reasons
(Boy, you'll never get on)
Don't you forget you come from nothing
(Boy you'll never get on)
That wind is calling my name
I won't wait
Or I'll never get on

It's not hard to live like a ghost
I just haunt all that I've wanted and leave what I don't
I dreamt a trail up to the sky
And my brothers built propellers just to see how far they'd fly
You might also like
So hold high how faint your reasons (Boy, you'll never get on)
Your flashing sparrows chasin' with them (Boy, you'll never get on)
Don't you forget you come from nothing (Boy, you'll never get on)
That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait or I'll never get on

That wind is calling my name
And I won't wait or I'll never get on

So hold high how faint your reasons
Hold up high how faint your reasons
Hold high how faint your reasons
That wind is calling my name
I won't wait or I'll never get
