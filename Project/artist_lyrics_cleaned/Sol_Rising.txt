I do what I have to
Yeah I got some rivals
I started from nothing
Yeah I picked it up  I call it survival
I move in silence
Sometimes I go viral
Im taking my chances I’m shooting my shots
I ain’t talking rifles
Since a youngin I’m down in the streets 
My homies told me told me that I gotta believe 
Everybody here fighting for life
Keep doing what’s right as long as You breathe
They got my back for life I just shoot for the stars that’s what we agreed
Nowadays  I stay out of trouble im grateful that I got a family to feed
I’m doing this for own cause ain’t no time for impressing
I made mistakes when I opened the wrong doors glad it taught me a lesson
I Wasted time regretting the past when I had to stick to progressing
Imma teach love to thye people around me if I die Imma go as a legend
.
