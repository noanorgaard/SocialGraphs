There’s soft sounds when we hit touch down
Get out of your head
Come out
Soft sounds when we hit touch down
Get out of your head

If you want, I could scream it from the rooftops
One touch and I’m in love
I know it’s not forever but we could stay real together

And you’re never gonna see ‘till you’re free
I could show you everything
But you think I’m just 18

Soft sounds when we hit touch down
Get out of your head

If you want, I could scream it from the rooftops
One touch and I’m in love
I know it’s not forever but we could stay real together
One touch and I’m in love
One touch and I’m in love

If you want, I could scream it from the rooftops
One touch and I’m in love
I know it’s not forever but we could stay real together
One touch and I’m in
