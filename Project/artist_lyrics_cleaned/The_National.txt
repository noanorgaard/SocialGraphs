Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said "I'm sorry"
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller

There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, and I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and 

How close am I
To losing you?

Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

How close am I
To losing you?

Hey
Are you awake?
Yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today?

Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything

It's a Hollywood summer
You'd never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone

I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil

I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
I fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City to all the silver girls

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

Don't do this, I don't do this to you
And don't expect me to enjoy it
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to turn the volume up inside my
Ears, for years I used to put my
Head inside the speakers
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

I get a little punchy with the vodka
Just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did
When he had to deal with those people like you
Who made no goddamn common sense
I'd rather walk all the way home right now
Than to spend one more second in this place
I'm exactly like you, Valentine, just
Come outside and leave with me

Let's just get high enough to see our problems
Let's just get high enough to see our fathers' houses

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I wanna sit in and die

This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
It takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me

Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
