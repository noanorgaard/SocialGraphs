In a dark room, in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself between your legs
Your medicine is in my head

But then you call me on the phone

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

I tell myself "I like that"
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that

For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done
All these years, no, yeah
For all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should yeah
