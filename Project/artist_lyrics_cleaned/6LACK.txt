But she want the goddamn sky

Uh, list of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fuckin' callin'
It's crazy, I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week, you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her, but next week, you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it, but just know it workin' for me
She text me, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you"
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
