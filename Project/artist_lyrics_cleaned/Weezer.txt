You told me you would bring presents and treats
Cheering my spirits with homemade sweet meats
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself

Oh, could you ever know how much I care?
Could you ever know that out somewhere
There's a boy who really hurts?

Since I've found you
I've found a girl
I've found a thorn
I've found a queen
Now I am warm

When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it, too

On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

Hip, hip
Hip, hip

When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me

Then I said, "Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to
(I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)
So make a move (Make a move)
'Cause I ain’t got all night"

The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

Then I say girl, if you're wondering if I want you to

I swear it's true (swear it's true)
Without you, my heart is blue
Ooh-ooh, oh, oh, girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to

So make the move (Make the move)
'Cause I ain’t got all night"

So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say

When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me

Then I'll say, "Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to

Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (How cool is that?)
How cool is that? So I went to your room
And read your diary
"Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table"
And then my heart stopped, "Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again" (Ow)

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute?
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
"I'm falling for you"

I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)

Somebody's Heine
Is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Oh, yeah
Alright
Feels good

Flip on the telly

The bottle is ready to blow

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean (Oh my god, do you see them?)
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between

I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
