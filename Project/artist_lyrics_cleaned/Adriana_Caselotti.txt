Just whistle while you work


And cheerfully together, we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune


It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love, and soon
You'll find you're dancing to the tune
When hearts are high, the time will fly, so whistle while you work

Was the princess you?

And she fell in love

Was it hard to do?

Well, it was very easy
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming
The only one for me

Was he, uh, uh, strong and handsome?

Was he big and tall?

There's nobody like him
Anywhere at all
You might also like
Did he say he loved ya?

Did he steal a kiss?

He was so romantic
I could not resist
Some day, my prince will come
Some day, we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever, I know
Some day, when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day, when my dreams come
