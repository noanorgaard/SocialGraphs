Remember on Christmas day, way before you resigned to the boxes with socks in
There were still toys and games, action figures, rock 'em sock 'ems
TCG hot decks, VHS box sets, we were given so many options
Big package in the kitchen, hid a space hopper that my brother hadn't popped yet
Every single gift bagged thing that hid beneath the tree, it could've been a shrink wrapped
Tracy Island playset, sneaking downstairs with my brother in thе AM
Tryna get our peak, but our parents had us bеat and we're waiting cause we're on the same wavelength
Nowadays things don't go the same, but we'll give it back to them with the paychecks

I could take it back to kids books and play pens
Action figures and the wooden train sets
Pretend kitchens, I was cooking fake eggs
Imagination was wild with nay end
Burn rubber with the Hot Wheels
Remote planes with the brother in law, down by the Crop Fields
I'd lay patient
Just wait for a turn on the PlayStation
Vacation for me was a trip round toys 'R' us
Cross universe, pitting up a Zoid verse Buzz
Treehouse gang that be where the boys are cause
Need the password to join our club
Now I'm grown enough, I play poker, but
I still poke hunt when I do go for runs
Reminisce when the kid got his Lego City build set
Been building an Empire since then
You might also like
I've been moving through the block, no Lego, aye, getting to the bread, no Play Dough, aye
Play time with Bae, all she want is the slinky, I slip and I slide in all day yo
It's Saint Diggolas, fly like I'm Icarus
Lit like a yo-yo cause I'm wild when I hit the tricks
So limitless, the style I deliver with
Can never Nerf the talent cause the mind is ridicolous
It's, it's useless
Bet you can find what the clue is
So guess who did
I got it all locked like a Rubiks
It's this cool, it's always been a game of what you see and you say
My talent a gift, are you catching my drift? And I get in my bag with these beats that I sleigh

Got him on my hip like a Tamagochi, I got Game Boy, call it quality
In my pocket, boy, no Polly, more cake than an easy bake
He gon bop it if I say, super soaker with the wave
I don't do no second place, I sock 'em, bop 'em like
Jake did Nate, you still suck on gravity
Moon Shoes how I move and Tek Tek dudes is how I really skate
Tell that talk boy do what I say or you can walk, man, that's OK
I'm buzzing light years far away, aye

At the break of dawn we will awake
Think about the noise we bout to make
Cause we playing
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, aye
You know it's a Nine, I present these gifts of mine
I got wrapping paper on Lord Wader and his lightsaber flashing and glowing with them L.E.D. lights
Not a grim day, but we on lockdown, Grimlock, hey? Transform, roll out
Got Optimus Prime up on his callouts, like Todd Howard he had sold out
I got an action man, I'm calling camera and lights, people coming together like it's Mighty Morphin time
Got 'em wishing and spinning like a Beyblade, McFarlane they made Halo figures just right
No cap, forget Nerf, that's not what it's about
Red Ryder, but you might fire, shoot your eye out
From cars to trains, lay 'em out on the track
Got UK bars for days, you can call that a wrap

Jumping outta the box and I'm popping off
You come around and the people start nodding off
Delivery at your door and I got a lot
I can transform flows, a lyrical Autobot
Whenever you come around I know they gon hate it
Like giving a PlayStation to an old lady
Because only a day later you get donated
My team is in the building, you can not be located
Yeah, they gon keep us, these rappers coming together and snap just like Lego pieces
You can stretch out, but you just don't reach us, arm's not strong enough, you can't beat us
People put me up on a pedestal prolific, see the way that I handle these clowns, they get dismissed
Nobody really putting you down on a wish list, probably end up in lost and found this Christmas
Stacked with the deck, cards super effective
It's a no go when you lose, I've collected
Every go go, so bro, are you impressed yet?
Letting rip my Bey, your Bae swoons, I'm the best? Bet
Wild with the thoughts, building bases out of Lego
No matter what I make, well it's simply just the demo
Lived with the best type of toys by chance
Every night I'm the greatest on the Game Boy Advance
Man it's Time to Duel, when I win I take your set
Cars fully fueled, build a track, you can't correct
Party on the floor, Dance Dance Revolution
New tech coming out, it's the gaming evolution
Blowing off the dust going back years later
Omnitrix works and there's no feeling greater
Approaching Christmas, get the wish list ready
Flowing like the water in a gun, come get me uh

I got major gifts on the wish list
Sentances shine like lights on Christmas
I must admit, I got a penchant for riches
Shiny diamonds and pendants
I'm on a mission, plus I'm ambitious
We doubling digits, collecting images like it was Pintrest
No maybes, I'm all in the trenches
Fisher price, I'm hype, now the specifics
I got She-Ra, the power princess, strawberry shortcake is all in the kitchen
My Little Pony just for the kisses, no tea sets, I never did dishes
Teddy Ruxpin be spitting it vicious, convincing
Slipping my tape in the Alf, figure it out we surfing the couch, I like it when he eat the kittens

At the break of dawn we will awake
Think about the noise we bout to make
Cause we playing
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, aye

I remember go bots
Got nothing but punches like I'm a rock 'em sock 'em robot
Handcuffed to the toys, but there's no cops
Brain ball, catching everything that you throw pops
Whistle like a Vortex, corvette
Matchbox toy sets, race cars on deck
Hot Wheels, new feels with the concepts
Silly buddy, go silly Putty with projects
Yap back for the feedback to the lite brights, know they need that, squeeze that like Green Gak
Let it stretch to let the lines Knexs, then shake 'em up like a Etch and Sketch in one breath
Slow it down, you doing double time for something
I'm too OP for my character, that's why I get Nerfed for nothing

They say my lite brite, so I rhyme like
I'm adding color to your world like Lisa Frank might
Dark days, but stay brighter than a Worm Light
Take the good with the bad, it's alright
The game of perfection's overrated
Life ain't a polly pocket masqueraded
Gotta bop it, spin it, pull it, twist it
Flick it, mold it, skip it, bounce

I remember them Christmas days, didn't really do much for me
Nobody went outta their way to get new toys and store trees
We had more issues to face, but not much time to be jolly
But me, I still had faith that one day there would be no worries
That day I'd get a Dark Knight
He'd guard me through my dark nights
I know I'd get a Man of Steel
If I just had good manners still
Not nothing changed, just got worse then coming to the head
But then I asked my mom about it and she said, she said
Uh, look Anthony, that agony that rises like a canopy
What's happening is that it's actually just manning me in prep for the man I'll be
Then I realised that my life is legit
Gotta keep grinding till I am the shit
Bring the joy back to the face of my kin
Do you wanna know why? Because I am their gift

At the break of dawn we will awake
Think about the noise we bout to make
Cause we playing
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way, feel me
We on the way,
