There are certain
Feelings that I have for you
They've been bubbling
Since the day that we were introduced

I don't know (Don't know) what to do
'Cause I'm so gone (I'm so gone) over you (Hey)
And I (I) don't know why
(I feel this way, yeah)

Don't quite know (Don't quite know) what it is
Something 'bout you, baby
Something 'bout you, baby
Not for sure what it is (What it is, what it is)
Something 'bout you, baby
Something 'bout you, baby

It's the little, mmm
Things you do that turn me on
Like a pillow
You're so soft, baby, we belong together

I don't know (I don't know) what to do
(Just what to do about it)
'Cause I'm so gone over you (Baby, I)
And I don't know why
(Don't know why I feel this way but I know it's something 'bout you, baby)

Don't quite know (Don't quite know) what it is
(What it is)
Something 'bout you, baby (What it is)
Something 'bout you, baby
Not for sure (What it is) what it is
(Something about you)
Something 'bout you, baby
(Something about you)
Something 'bout you, baby
(And I really don't know)
Don't quite know (What it is, yeah) what it is
(But I think I'm ready)
Something 'bout you, baby
(To know, yeah)
Something 'bout you, baby
(Something about you)
Not for sure (Oh yeah) what it is
(What it is, what it is)
Something 'bout you, baby (Oh)
Something 'bout you, baby
Is it your walk? (The way that you walk, yeah)
Or the way that you talk? (Or the way you talk)
Whatever it is, I'm loving it
(I'm loving it)
Is it your eyes? (Is it your eyes?)
Or pretty smile (Oh oh)
Whatever it is (I'm loving it)

Don't quite know (I don't quite know) what it is
(But I gotta have you)
Something 'bout you, baby (You)
Something 'bout you, baby (Oh baby)
Not for sure (Oh) what it is (What it is)
Something 'bout you, baby
(Something about you, baby)
Something 'bout you, baby
(So sexy, baby)
Don't quite know (Ow) what it is (What it is)
Something 'bout you, baby (Oh baby)
Something 'bout you, baby (Got me so)
Not for sure what it is (I want to know this)
Something 'bout you, baby
(And I can't keep my)
Something 'bout you, baby
Something 'bout you (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you (Something about you, baby)
Hey hey, something 'bout you, something (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you, something (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you, oh oh oh (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you, yeah yeah yeah yeah (Something 'bout you)
Something 'bout you, yeah
