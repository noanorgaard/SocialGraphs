Unenlightened shadows cast
Down through all eternity
The crying of humanity

When truth gets very deep
Beneath a thousand years of sleep
Time demands a turn around
And once again the truth is found

Your eyes feel like silence resting on me
And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted

A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew
And he knows he shouldn't kill

Who's to live and who's to die
And he never sees the writing on the wall

His orders come from far away no more
They come from here and there and you and me
And brothers can't you see
This is not the way we put the end to
