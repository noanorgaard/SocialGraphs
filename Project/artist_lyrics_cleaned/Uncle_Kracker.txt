Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you
You can carry me through

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

You make me smile like the sun, fall out of bed
Sing like a bird, dizzy in my head
Spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, uzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

Spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
