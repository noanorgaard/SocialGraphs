Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

What you do with trash? You take it out
So why are you lettin' him hang around?
Girl, you gotta know when to clean house
And throw his shit out in the yard
If it was the first time, I would understand
But it's the third time, he got a second chance
There's a fine line between an accident
And an L-O-S-E-R

It's bullshit, you know it
Yeah, I see it in your eyes
Every time that you tell me
Deep down, he's a really good guy

That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your damn mind
You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
Swears up and down that it's gonna be

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

The sun's in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

Together, together
We can do whatever, whatever

We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party

Where you had your birthday, just who was there
Buy you a shot, then hold back your hair
Take you to Waffle House
We're the circles that you're runnin' when you're runnin' around
Bail you out, make you laugh, pick you up when you're down
Hangin' out in your hometown
Hey, that's what it's all about
