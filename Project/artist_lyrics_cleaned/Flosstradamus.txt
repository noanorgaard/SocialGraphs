Unreal
The thrills, they yield
Until, they kill

In the darkness I am weakened
I’ll soon regret it
I can hear my mind creakin'
Try to forget it
Lose control of all my senses
All of a sudden I just relapse
Too late for me I always go back

One bye one
And I’ll do it again, and I’ll do it again
Temptation
And I’ll do it again
[Chorus
So we rebound hard
Wake up scarred
This is not what we’re supposed to do
Rebound hard
Back to the start
Will I always belong to you?
This is not what we’re supposed to do

Lets say goodbye then I’m leaving
We won't regret it
And for a second I am healing
Try to forget it
With just a touch I’m defenseless
All of a sudden I just relapse
I know I said I wouldn't go back



I can run away mixing color with the grey
So I’ll hold back, give me time to recover
I can run away pressing pause on your replay
And then I’ll do it again
I can run away mixing color with the grey
So I’ll hold back, give me time to recover
I can run away pressing pause on your replay
But we go back cause we’re bound together
