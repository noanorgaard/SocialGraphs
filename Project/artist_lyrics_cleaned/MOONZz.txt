I say oh darling, could you satisfy me
Cause I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
Roaming down the streets quietly
Shhh
Begging, begging you to save me
But I'm working out the courage in me
Up up and away
Up up and away

Oh Satisfy (Oh Satisfy)
Oh Satisfy (Oh Satisfy)
Oh Satisfy (Oh Satisfy)
Oh Satisfy (Oh Satisfy)

Looking at you boy, I know you see me
How about you come over here and make something happen
Walk around with a big fat grin on my face
Yeah, it feels like things with you are falling into place
Rain oh shine, You know I will make you mine (Oh Satisfy)
Rain oh shine, You know I will make you mine
Breeep

I gotta think
I guess you noticed
I gotta think
Yup
I gotta think
I guess you noticed
I gotta think
Yup
