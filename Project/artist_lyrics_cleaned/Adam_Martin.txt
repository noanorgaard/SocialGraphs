Walk out the door
A picture of you I carry on my heart
I'll follow this road, wherever it goes
I'll brave the fire
Sometimes it feels this life is done
But the road ahead has just begun
What are you waiting for?
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours, if you want it
We've come so far
But don't look down
This world is yours, this world is yours
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours, if you want it
We've come so far
But don't look down
This world is yours, this world is yours
I'll cross every sea
The great divide
All my friends say I'm loosing my mind
It's me against the storm
Taking on the wind
I'll brave the fire
Sometimes it feels this life is done
But the road ahead has just begun
What are you waiting for?
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours, if you want it
We've come so far
But don't look down
This world is yours, this world is yours
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours, if you want it
We've come so far
But don't look down
This world is yours, this world is yours
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours if you want it
We've come so far
But don't look down
This world is yours, this world is yours
Just try your luck
But don't look back
This world is yours if you want itYou might also
