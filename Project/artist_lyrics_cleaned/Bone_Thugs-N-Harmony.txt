Hey, my niggas, we havin' a wonderful day
And I won't fuck with me, why? 'Cause it's the first of the month
And now we smokin', jokin', rollin' blunts
And sippin' on forty ounces, thuggin'
Come, come, we've got the blunts and rum
Fucked up and all night, we high
Hit up the block to where? East 99
I get with my nigga to get me some yayo
Double up, "Nigga, what you need?"
"We got weed to get P.O.D.'d, fiend for the green leaves"
Double up for the first, fo' sho' better lay low
'Cause the po-po creep when they roll slow
If you can't get away, better toss that yayo
Keep your bankroll
Yeah, we havin' a celebration, love to stay high
And you better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine, crime after crime
Fin to creep to the pad cause moms got the grub on the grill
And we got the 4-0, you know it's the first of the month
And my nigga, we chills for real

She said, "I'ma run and go get my stamps"
"Watch and make sure no one snatches my check"
Nigga, that's the mailman
Sort through the mail and put it up into me pocket
So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 duckets
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid
Playa, playa, holla, holla, St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of yayo and a quarter O, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po
Toss all that yayo then roll with a pound and stay low

Gonna get a .40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner, St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap, pap
From the 1st to the 15th
Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad, count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block

Wakin' up, feelin' buzzed, up early mornin', stretchin', I'm yawnin'
Lightweight, bent, chugga-lugga take a 5th to the dome
Instead I kick it with my trues
But it's the first, so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know, did your O.G. check come?
Sure, put me down!
I'ma hop on the bus with Biz (yo brother, let's get drunk!)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of the skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the first come around
Now I be freakin' me Black N' Mild
Headed cross town cause niggas, the first get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild, 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the first, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and twenties and fifties
The first be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the first, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs

Nigga, we doin' this shit from Cleveland to L.A., nigga
Whatever you niggas want, we bring it!
Thug Luv, (biatch!) nigga what time is it?
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at, nigga
It's time to slay these bitch-made niggas!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at? Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I know you niggas been waitin' for this for a long time
Well, here it is, nigga, here it is!
What you gonna do with it?

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
You know, that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressin' it softly
Get 'em up off me, 'cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing 'em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't, stop me and pop me
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, let's manage, to damage, all y'all
I'll, talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em, to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I, finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine
Fuck them niggas, it's on
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow, follow, my kids!
But don't sin, in my steps!
Yet the weapon is kept, with the best of my secrets
Heaving the leaves in my lungs, nigga, believe
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland

Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga? (yeah!)
Put your muthafuckin' hands on your strap, nigga
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out (Thug luv)
Or do this like punks, and punk it out
Pull your strap on me (Thug luv), nigga, you better kill me!
Thug Life, baby. Thug Luv

I'll probably be punished for hard livin', blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts, in God's prison, hands on the strap
Prayin' so Father please forgive me!
Police be rushin' when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on TV
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic, when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these, bitch niggas "Bring it on"
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a, cold-ass world; niggas, kill you in your sleep
Watch me, until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got, Thug Luv for my nationwide posse, feel me!
Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work and do some dirt
Fuckin' around with the band Bone, Thugs-N-Harmony
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya!
So quick to test us, nigga wanna press me, eat dust
For the love of the lust, niggas bustin' on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge erupt!
It's my Art of War, puttin' niggas on the floor
When I'm comin' through the door, bringin' nuthin' but terror
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era
Paired up, with a nigga like Pac
And a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg, the Lord to save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah

Here to get it, told my niggas they need get, Down
With the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds, and if you're passin' through
Then hit the ground, and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fuckin' with this
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend
I reload, and buck a little mo'
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know
"So, who ya looking for?" They don't know!
A mothafucka with a leatherface
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away (yeah)
A criminal mind, to keep a nigga on the level
Sometimes, so get high, and analyze your crime
Correctly organized and with results, you'll be surprised
Oh, nigga, can you feel the vibe? We can ride
Playa hating niggas, you gots to die, it's only right
Fucking with Bone, better leave it alone
Mo Thugs come crack their fuckin' domes
Still in the hood, where the thugs play
Fuckin' with nuthin' but thugs, mane
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
We crackin' them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level, nigga, get a shovel
You can dig a hole; bitches is dead!
Infrared, to your head. You can beg, you can fled
But still gonna bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine, we'll be seen in the moonlight
'Cause we out ridin', lookin' for you (For you)
Better run for cover, nigga, duck!
We about to bust, Straight got the infrared, put it on his forehead
Make some moves, send flowers straight to his home
Put a card in the muthafucka, send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong, dead wrong
Now he long gone, long gone

'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!

Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out "Mo'!" and let me hear ya holla

Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank

No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me victim
The blood in me runnin' my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The bud in me running me pencil
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies
