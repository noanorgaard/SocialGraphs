Known for their jaunty [[Beat music|beat]] sound and Noone's often tongue-in-cheek vocal style, the Hermits charted with numerous transatlantic hits in the UK and in America, where they ranked as one of the most successful acts in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-led [[British Invasion]]. Between March and August 1965 in the United States, the group logged twenty-four consecutive weeks in the Top Ten of [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]] with five singles, including the two number ones \"[[Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter]]\" and \"[[I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am|I'm Henry VIII, I Am]]\". \n\nTheir other international hits in the 1960s include \"[[I'm into Something Good]]\" (their sole UK number one), \"[[Can't You Hear My Heartbeat]]\", the two covers \"[[Silhouettes (The Rays song)|Silhouettes]]\" and \"[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]\", \"[[A Must to Avoid]]\", \"[[Listen People]]\", \"[[No Milk Today]]\", \"[[There's a Kind of Hush]]\", \"[[I Can Take or Leave Your Loving]]\", \"[[Something's Happening (Herman's Hermits song)|Something's Happening]]\" and \"[[My Sentimental Friend]]\", all of which were produced by [[Mickie Most]]. Herman's Hermits also appeared in four films, two of which were vehicles for the band.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early days ===\nHerman's Hermits was formed from two different local bands. [[Keith Hopwood]] (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Karl Green (lead guitar, backing vocals), Alan Wrigley (bass), Steve Titterington (drums) and [[Peter Noone]] (lead vocals) came from the Heartbeats where Hopwood had replaced rhythm guitarist Alan Chadwick.<ref name=\"60sew\">{{cite web |last1=Wells |first1=Emily |title=Interview with Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits |url=http://loving60s.loveisonlysleeping.com/60s-musician-interviews/peter-noone/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211023/http://loving60s.loveisonlysleeping.com/60s-musician-interviews/peter-noone/ |archive-date=23 October 2021 |access-date=22 December 2020 |website=Loving 60s |date=7 January 2017 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> The second-youngest member of a young group (four months older than Karl Green who was originally in the Balmains),<ref name=\"60sew\" /> 15-year-old Noone was already an experienced actor on the popular British TV soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Derek \"Lek\" Leckenby (lead guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums) (born Jan Barry Whitwam) joined later from another local group, the Wailers. Whitwam replaced Titterington on drums, Green switched to bass guitar (replacing Wrigley) and Leckenby took over for Green as lead guitarist. After Leckenby joined the band, the group made a deal with producer Mickie Most and signed with [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone|Columbia]] label in Europe and MGM Records in the United States.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hermans-hermits-p4476/biography Allmusic.com biography.] Retrieved 7 March 2011.</ref>\n\nThe band's name came from a resemblance, noted by a publican in Manchester, England, between Noone and [[Mister Peabody#Background|Sherman]] from the ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends|Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' cartoons. Sherman was shortened to Herman and then became Herman and His Hermits, which was soon shortened to Herman's Hermits.<ref>{{cite web |title=Herman's Hermits \u2013 Magazine Articles |url=http://www.hermanshermits.com/articles/misc/flashback10_p2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514091742/http://www.hermanshermits.com/articles/misc/flashback10_p2.html |archive-date=14 May 2006 |access-date=31 October 2011 |publisher=Hermanshermits.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s fame ===\n[[Harvey Lisberg]] discovered them and signed on as their manager. He sent a plane ticket to London record producer [[Mickie Most]] so that he could fly to see the band play in [[Bolton]]. Most, already successful with [[the Animals]], became the group's producer and controlled the band's output. He emphasised a simple and non-threatening clean-cut image.\n\nTheir chart debut was a cover of [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]'s \"[[I'm into Something Good]]\" (a then-recent US Top 40 hit for [[Earl-Jean McCrea|Earl-Jean]]). In September 1964, it replaced [[the Kinks]]' \"[[You Really Got Me]]\" at number one in the [[UK singles chart]] and in December reached no. 13 in the US. The Hermits never topped the British charts again. However, in America in 1965\u2014when ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranked them America's top singles act of the year (with the Beatles at no. 2)\u2014they topped the [[US Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] with two non-UK releases: \"[[Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter]]\" and \"[[I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am|I\u2019m Henry VIII, I Am]]\u201d (a remake of the 1910 [[Cockney]]-style music hall song  \"I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am\"). The no. 12 debut of \"Mrs. Brown\" on the Hot 100 in April 1965 was the decade's third highest (behind [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and \"[[Get Back]]\").[[File:I'm into Something Good - Cash Box ad 1964.jpg|thumb|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, September 26, 1964|left]]The band played on most of its singles, including \"I'm into Something Good\", \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\", \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\", \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\" (said at the time to be \"the fastest-selling song in history\"),<ref>MacInnes, Colin (1965) \"The Old English Music Hall Songs Are New.\" ''The New York Times,'' 28 November 1965, p.

Leckenby soloed on \"Henry\" and Hopwood played rhythm guitar on \"Mrs. Brown\".<ref>Noone interview, Hopwood personal correspondence</ref>  Despite the group's competent musicianship, some subsequent singles employed session musicians\u2014including [[Big Jim Sullivan]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[Vic Flick]] and [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]]\u2014with contributions from the band, although the role of session players on Herman's Hermits records has been exaggerated in the rock media{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and in liner notes on the 2004 [[ABKCO Records]] compilation ''Retrospective'' (which does not credit the Hermits' playing). Mickie Most used session musicians on many records he produced; this was industry practice then.<ref>Davis, Stephen, ''Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga''</ref>\n\nBetween late 1964 and early 1968, Herman's Hermits never failed to reach the Top 40 in the States. Six of their 11 US Top Tens were not released as A-side singles in their native UK, including the two aforementioned number ones plus \"[[Can't You Hear My Heartbeat]]\" (no. 2), \"[[Listen People]]\"  (no. 3), a cover of [[Noel Gay]]'s 1937 song \"[[Leaning on a Lamp-post]]\" (no. 9, under the title \"Leaning on the Lamp Post\") and their version of [[Ray Davies]]'s \"[[Dandy (song)|Dandy]]\" (no. 5). Conversely they hit big in Britain between 1968 and 1970 with several major hits which failed to register in America, among them the four Top Tens \"[[Sunshine Girl (Herman's Hermits song)|Sunshine Girl]]\" (no. 8), \"[[Something's Happening (Herman's Hermits song)|Something's Happening]]\" (no. 6), \"[[My Sentimental Friend]]\" (no. 2) and \"[[Years May Come, Years May Go]]\" (no. 7). Their final UK hit, \"[[Lady Barbara]]\" (no. 13), released in the autumn of 1970, was credited to 'Peter Noone & Herman's Hermits'.\n[[File:Hermans Hermits 1965.jpg|thumb|Herman's Hermits in 1965]]\n[[File:HermansHermits1965.jpg|thumb|Herman's Hermits circa 1965]]In America the group appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''. The group's US records were released by [[MGM Records]], which often showcased its musical performers in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] films. The band appeared in several movies.<ref>{{cite web |date=29 May 2011 |title=Peter Noone interview |url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2011/05/peter_noone_interview.html |access-date=1 October 2023 |work=NJ.com True Jersey |quote=}}</ref> On screen the Hermits featured opposite [[Connie Francis]] in ''[[When the Boys Meet the Girls (film)|When the Boys Meet the Girls]]'' (1965) and starred outright in ''[[Hold On!

They also appeared in the 1965 British music revue film ''[[Pop Gear]]''. [[P. F. Sloan]] wrote the Hermits soundtrack title track to the 1966 film ''Hold On!''.

The latter climbed to no. 4 in March 1967. \"No Milk Today\" peaked at no. 35, though it was linked to \"Hush\" on local charts nationwide. \"No Milk Today\" also scored in its own right, including success on San Francisco Top 40 station KFRC, where in April 1967, it reached no. 1, ranking 6 for the year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Joel Whitburn |url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur |title=Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132002 |publisher=Record Research, Inc |year=2003 |isbn=0-89820-155-1 |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/312 312] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 the group was nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]] including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] of 1965\u2014they lost to singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]\u2014and two for their chart-topper \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\": [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group|Best Performance by a Vocal Group]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Contemporary (R&R) Performance \u2013 Group (Vocal or Instrumental)]]. According to Noone and Hopwood, \"Mrs. Brown\" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes\u2014using two microphones, with Hopwood on guitar, Green on bass guitar and Whitwam on drums. Noone and the band deliberately emphasised their English accents on the record, never intended to be a single. Hopwood recalls playing a [[Gretsch Country Gentleman]] guitar in the studio, with its strings muted to create the distinctive sound. When playing the song live, Hopwood often used a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar with a rag tied around the bridge to duplicate the sound, which can be seen clearly in old performance clips.\n\nThe 1967 album ''Blaze'' received critical acclaim,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} but barely made the Top 100 in the US and did not chart in the UK. The album included original songs by Leckenby, Whitwam, Hopwood, Green and Noone, including \"Ace King Queen Jack\" and the [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] \"Moonshine Man\".\n[[File:Herman's Hermits 1966 Hullabaloo.jpg|thumb|Green, Leckenby, and Noone on the set of [[Hullabaloo (TV series)|''Hullabaloo'']], {{circa|early 1966}}]]\nIn 1968, Hopwood and Leckenby eventually started a music company, Pluto Music, which is still in business as of 2023, working primarily on commercial and animation soundtracks. \n\nA 1969 two-disc album ''Herman's Hermits Rock 'n' Roll Party'' was never released.\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present ===\nPeter Noone left in 1971 to pursue a solo career in the United States. In 1973, a cover of the song \"[[(I Think I'm Over) Getting Over You]]\" went to number 63 on the Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nWhen Noone left the group in 1971, the Hermits continued, first with singer Pete Cowap. They signed with RCA Records in the UK and, as \"The Hermits\", recorded two singles at [[Strawberry Studios]] and an unreleased album (under the name ''Sourmash'') produced by [[Eric Stewart]]. The group subsequently cut one-off singles for Private Stock, Buddah, and Roulette in 1975, 1976, and 1977 without significant success. Noone did return to front Herman's Hermits during a 1973\u20131974 U.S. multi-artist tour of \"[[British Invasion]]\" acts, after which Whitwam, Leckenby, and Green (who assumed lead vocal duties until his 1980 retirement) continued to tour with newer members, including Rod Gerrard (formerly with [[Wayne Fontana]] & [[the Mindbenders]] and Salford Jets).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Hopwood left in 1972.\n\nKarl Green left the band in 1980 to spend more time with his family. He later opened a plumbing and tiling business in London.\n\nIn 1986, the Hermits opened for [[the Hep Stars]] and [[the Monkees]] on their 1980s reunion tours of the US.\n\nHopwood has since become a composer of scores for film and television. Green has become a manager of sound systems for concert venues along London's [[South Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl2001/photogallery.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211023/http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl2001/photogallery.html| archive-date=23 October 2021 |title=Big L RSL 2001 in Clacton \u2013 Photogallery of the Stars |publisher=Radiolondon.co.uk |date=6 January 1965 |access-date=31 October 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n[[File:Herman\u2019s_Hermits_\u2013_Appen_musiziert_2014_04.jpg|thumb|Herman\u2019s Hermits during their 50 year anniversary tour in April 2014.
