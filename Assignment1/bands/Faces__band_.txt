They were formed by members of [[Small Faces]] after lead singer and guitarist [[Steve Marriott]] left to form [[Humble Pie]]. The remaining Small Faces; [[Ian McLagan]] (keyboards), [[Ronnie Lane]] (bass, vocals), and [[Kenney Jones]] (drums and percussion) were joined by guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]] and singer [[Rod Stewart]], both from [[the Jeff Beck Group]], and the new line-up was renamed Faces.\n\nThe group had a unique recording arrangement, as Stewart had signed a solo recording contract with the Mercury label shortly before joining the group, which was signed to Warner Bros.  Band members often contributed to Stewart's solo albums as contract players, and Faces' live shows of the period featured as much of Stewart's solo material as that of the band, which later fuelled tensions amongst them when they began to effectively be viewed as Stewart's 'backing band'. The group lacked a single main songwriter, as from the beginning each member worked in tandem to offer songs for each of their albums (Stewart and Wood most often wrote together as a duo, as did Lane and Wood, while Lane usually contributed at least one solo composition per album).  While Stewart was the primary lead singer, both Lane and Wood sang lead vocals on several tracks (Lane usually sang lead on his own solo compositions).  Their first two albums, ''[[First Step (Faces album)|First Step]]'' (1970) and ''[[Long Player (album)|Long Player]]'' (1971), lacked a hit single, but their third album, 1971's ''[[A Nod Is As Good As a Wink... to a Blind Horse]]'', bolstered by the success of Stewart's solo work, became a worldwide hit, peaking at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number 6 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and spawning the band's first hit single, \"[[Stay with Me (Faces song)|Stay with Me]]\".\n\nTensions in the band came to a head during the recording of their fourth (and final) studio album, 1973's ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]]''.  Lane, who was a founding member of Small Faces, left over his diminished role in the band in 1973, and was replaced by [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] on bass.  The band continued to tour throughout 1974 and 1975, releasing a live album, ''[[Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners]]'', in 1974 that was jointly credited to Stewart/Faces.  Wood also began to drift from the group over this period, releasing two solo albums of his own, and appearing as a guest musician on two [[Rolling Stones]] albums and joining them on tour in 1975.  He was briefly augmented by [[Jesse Ed Davis]] on guitars before the band broke up at the end of 1975.\n\nA greatest hits collection, ''[[Snakes and Ladders / The Best of Faces]]'', appeared in 1976, and additional retrospective albums appeared over the subsequent decades.  Stewart continued his successful solo career, while Wood formally joined the Rolling Stones as a permanent member in 1976. Jones joined [[the Who]] as a replacement for the deceased [[Keith Moon]] in 1978. McLagan went on to work as a session and touring musician with a number of acts (including his own bands) throughout the 1970s until his death in 2014, while Lane's activities in the music business (which included 1977's critically lauded ''[[Rough Mix]]'' collaboration with [[Pete Townshend]]) were severely curtailed by 1980 due to the onset of [[multiple sclerosis]], which forced his eventual retirement by the early 1990s.\n\nThe original Small Faces had a reunion during the mid to late 1970s, with Marriott, Jones, and McLagan joined by [[Rick Wills]] on bass guitar, as Lane withdrew early due to his illness. In February 1993 original Faces bandmates Stewart and Wood appeared together on a studio soundstage before a live audience in Los Angeles to record an episode of MTV's ''Unplugged '' series airing the following May; an album with excerpts from the performance, ''[[Unplugged...and Seated]]'' \u2013 including several Faces songs \u2013 was subsequently released on CD to considerable acclaim.  A number of partial reunions of the Faces were rumoured throughout the 2000s, with various one-off performances involving surviving members occurring.  In 2010\u201311 a brief reunion tour occurred with [[Mick Hucknall]] and [[Glen Matlock]] on vocals and bass respectively. The Faces and Small Faces were jointly inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012. Stewart was scheduled to perform with the rest of the band, but was unable to do so at the last minute due to illness; he was replaced by Hucknall.\n\nSince 2021 Jones, Stewart and Wood have periodically reunited to record tracks for a new album under the Faces grouping.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rod-stewart-ron-wood-kenney-jones-faces-new-music-1198990/|title=Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, Kenney Jones Reunite for New Faces Recordings|first=Andy|last=Greene|website=Rollingstone.com|date=19 July 2021|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first collaboration among the future Faces was in a formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood's older brother [[Art Wood]] and [[Kim Gardner]]; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood's and Rod Stewart's commitments with The Jeff Beck Group.<ref name=\"nzentgrafwoodworks\">{{cite web |last=Zentgraf |first=Nico |title=Woodworks 1957\u20131975 |url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |access-date=23 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319105527/http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm |archive-date=19 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"artwoodobit\">{{cite news |last=Perrone |first=Pierre |title=Obituary: Art Wood: Frontman of the Artwoods |newspaper=The Independent |date=6 November 2006 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/art-wood-423177.html |access-date=27 February 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403155610/http://imdb.com/name/nm0939976/ |archive-date=3 April 2008}}</ref> Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000058372|tab=biography|label=The Faces Biography|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> Prior to any releases by the new Faces line-up, Wood and McLagan appeared on Stewart's first solo album in 1969, ''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' (known as ''The Rod Stewart Album'' in the US).

Rod Stewart's solo career continues to be extremely successful. Ron Wood joined the Rolling Stones and later became a full member with the departure of [[Mick Taylor]]. He remains a member of The Stones to this day and enjoys a parallel career as a portrait artist. Within months of leaving the band in 1973, Ronnie Lane formed Slim Chance and immediately scored a UK hit single with \"How Come?\" but this early success was soon compromised by a subsequent self-organised UK tour that ended in financial disaster. Nonetheless, three Slim Chance albums followed on Island Records between 1974 and 76, and in 1977 he also worked on ''[[Rough Mix]]''.<ref name=\"Lane Discogs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Pete-Townshend--Ronnie-Lane-Rough-Mix/master/170673 |title=Pete Townshend & Ronnie Lane - Rough Mix |year=1977 |publisher=Discogs|access-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223418/http://www.discogs.com/Pete-Townshend--Ronnie-Lane-Rough-Mix/master/170673 |archive-date=16 October 2015}}</ref> a joint album with [[the Who|Who]] guitarist [[Pete Townshend]].

The same line-up (minus Lane) reunited once more in 1993 when Rod Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award at the [[Brit Awards]]. Ronnie Lane made one of his final concert appearances in 1992 at a Ronnie Wood show with Ian McLagan on keyboards; the progression of Lane's multiple sclerosis finally forced his retirement from music by the mid-1990s and he died in 1997.\n\nIn February 1993 Rod Stewart and Ron Wood appeared together on a studio soundstage before a live audience in Los Angeles to record an episode of MTV's ''Unplugged '' series airing the following May; an album with excerpts from the performance, <i>[[Unplugged...and Seated]]</i> - including several Faces songs - was subsequently released on CD to considerable acclaim.\n\nIn 2004 a 4-disc Faces box set entitled ''[[Five Guys Walk into a Bar...]]'' was released by Rhino Records, featuring many of the band's most popular tracks as well as several previously unreleased songs.
