He expressed an interest in making music of his own by the age of five. Valenzuela was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and later taught himself the drums. Though Valenzuela was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditional right-handed version of the instrument.\n\nValenzuela was a 15-year-old student at Pacoima Junior High School at the time of the [[1957 Pacoima mid-air collision]].

Valenzuela began as a guitarist, and when the main vocalist left the group, he took over the position. On June 19, 1957, Valenzuela made his performing debut with The Silhouettes.\n\nValenzuela also attended [[San Fernando High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=San Fernando High School Alums {{!}} i am san fernando|url=http://iamsanfernando.com/san-fernando-alumni|website=iamsanfernando.com|access-date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Donna - La Bamba - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958|left]]\nA self-taught musician, Valenzuela was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances, Valenzuela often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing.\n\n[[Bob Keane]], the owner and president of small record label [[Del-Fi Records]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], was given a tip in May 1958 by San Fernando High School student Doug Macchia about a young performer from Pacoima by the name of Richard Valenzuela. Kids knew the performer as \"the [[Little Richard]] of [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]]\". Swayed by the Little Richard comparison, Keane went to see Valenzuela play a Saturday-morning matin\u00e9e at a movie theater in San Fernando. Impressed by the performance, he invited Valenzuela to audition at his home in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] area of Los Angeles, where he had a small recording studio in his basement. His recording equipment comprised an early stereo recorder (a two-track [[Ampex]] 601-2 portable) and a pair of [[Georg Neumann GmbH|Neumann]] U-47 condenser microphones.\nAfter this first audition, Keane signed Valenzuela to Del-Fi on May 14, 1958. At this point, the musician took the name \"Ritchie\" because, as Keane said, \"There were a bunch of 'Richards' around at that time, and I wanted it to be different.\" Similarly, Keane recommended shortening his surname to \"Valens\" from Valenzuela to widen his appeal beyond any obvious ethnic group.<ref>\"Valens, Ritchie.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 Feb. 2016.</ref> Valens was ready to enter the studio with a full band backing him. The musicians included [[Ren\u00e9 Hall]], [[Carol Kaye]], and [[Earl Palmer]]. The first songs recorded at [[Gold Star Studios]], at a single studio session one afternoon in May 1958, were [[\"Come On, Let's Go\"]], an original, credited to Valens/Kuhn (Keane's real name), and \"Framed\", a [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Leiber and Stoller]] tune. Pressed and released within days of the recording session, the record was a success. Valens' next record, a double A-side, had the song \"[[Donna (Ritchie Valens song)|Donna]]\" (written about a real girlfriend Donna Ludwig<ref>{{cite news|last=McIntosh|first=Barbara|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/09/04/the-reveries-of-valens-donna/dfcd57aa-ab5d-48f2-bea5-06ebf3ab5b29/ | title=The Reveries of Valens' Donna|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 4, 1987|access-date=May 30, 2020}}</ref>) coupled with \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\".

This concert was posthumously released as ''[[Ritchie Valens in Concert at Pacoima Jr. High]]''; it was Valens' only live performance ever recorded. In mid-December 1958, Valens left for [[New York City]].

Ludwig's parents disapproved of her dating a Hispanic man. Valens's song \"Donna\" was written for her. Their relationship became strained due to Valens' increasing popularity and touring. After his death, [[Elvis Presley]] had one of his bodyguards arrange a date with Ludwig so that he could know all about Valens.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hall of Fame Ritchie Valens |url=https://bobs.net/pages/hall-of-fame-ritchie-valens |access-date=2023-06-24 |website=Bob's Big Boy Burbank |language=en}}</ref> In 1987, she attended the premiere of ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', a biopic featuring the life and career of Valens.\n\n== Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959) ==\n[[File:Ritchie Valens Grave.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Grave of Valens and his mother at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]]]\n[[File:Winter Dance Party Tour Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster for the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour|left|270x270px]]{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}Valens was one of the five acts billed for the Winter Dance Party tour, performing with [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper|\"The Big Bopper\" J.

Valens was buried at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles]], California.\n\n==Legacy==\nValens was a pioneer of [[Chicano rock]] and [[Latin rock]], inspiring many musicians of Mexican heritage. He influenced the likes of [[Los Lobos]], [[Los Lonely Boys]], and [[Carlos Santana]], as Valens had become nationally successful at a time when very few Latinos were in [[American rock]] and [[American pop|pop]] music. He is considered the first Latino to successfully cross over into mainstream rock.\n\n\"La Bamba\" proved to be his most influential recording, not only by becoming a pop chart hit sung entirely in Spanish, but also because of its successful blending of traditional Latin American music with rock. Valens was the first to capitalize on this formula, which was later adopted by such varied artists as Carlos Santana, [[Selena]], [[Caifanes]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]], [[Circo (band)|Circo]], [[El Gran Silencio]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Gustavo Santaolalla]], and many others in the [[Latin alternative]] scene.
