Relf and Samwell-Smith were originally in a band named the Metropolitan Blues Quartet. After being joined by Dreja, McCarty, and [[Top Topham]], they performed at Kingston Art School in late May 1963 as a backup band for [[Cyril Davies]]. Following a couple of gigs in September 1963 as the Blue-Sounds, they changed their name to the Yardbirds. McCarty claims that Relf was the first to use the name; he may have got it from [[Jack Kerouac]]'s novel ''[[On the Road]]'', where it referred to railroad yard [[Hobo|hobos]].{{sfn|McCarty|2018|p=62}} He adds that Topham identified it as a nickname for jazz saxophonist [[Charlie Parker|Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker]].{{sfn|McCarty|2018|p=62}}\n\nThe quintet achieved notice on the burgeoning [[British rhythm and blues]] scene when they took over as the house band at the [[Crawdaddy Club]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], succeeding [[the Rolling Stones]]. Their repertoire drew from the [[Chicago blues]] of [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], and [[Elmore James]], including \"[[Smokestack Lightning]]\", \"[[Good Morning, School Girl|Good Morning Little School Girl]]\", \"[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]\", \"[[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\", \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\", \"Got Love if You Want It\", and \"[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]\".\n\nOriginal lead guitarist Topham left and was replaced by [[Eric Clapton]] in October 1963. Crawdaddy Club impresario [[Giorgio Gomelsky]] became their manager and first record producer. Under Gomelsky's guidance the Yardbirds toured Britain as the back-up band for blues legend [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] in December 1963 and early 1964.{{sfn|Russo|2016|p=241}} Recordings from the performances were released two years later during the height of Yardbird popularity on the album ''[[Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sonny-boy-williamson-the-yardbirds-mw0000327715|title=Sonny Boy Williamson & the Yardbirds \u2013 Album Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:The Yardbirds on ad 1965.jpg|thumb|left|The Yardbirds in 1964. L to R: Keith Relf, Eric Clapton, Jim McCarty, Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith.]] \nAfter the tours with Williamson, the Yardbirds signed to [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label in February 1964, and recorded more live tracks on 20 March at the legendary [[Marquee Club]] in London. The resulting album of mostly American blues and R&B covers, ''[[Five Live Yardbirds]]'', was released by Columbia nine months later, and it failed to enter the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Koda|Russo|2001|p=}} Over time, ''Five Live'' gained stature as one of the few high-quality live recordings of the era and as a historical document of both the British rock and roll boom of the 1960s and Clapton's time in the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/five-live-yardbirds-mw0000652174|title=''Five Live Yardbirds'' \u2013 Album Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> \n\nThe Clapton line-up recorded two singles, the blues \"[[I Wish You Would (Billy Boy Arnold song)|I Wish You Would]]\" and \"[[Good Morning, School Girl]]\", before the band scored its first major hit with \"[[For Your Love]]\", a [[Graham Gouldman]] composition with a prominent harpsichord part by [[Brian Auger]]. \"For Your Love\" was a Top-10 hit in the UK, Canada and the US but displeased Clapton, a blues purist whose vision extended beyond three-minute singles. Frustrated by their commercial approach, he abruptly left the band in March 1965, shortly after the single was released.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=44\u201345}} Soon after Clapton joined [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]],  [[Jeff Beck]] replaced him. The band first approached Jimmy Page, but content with his lucrative sessions work, and worried about both his health and the politics of Clapton's departure, Page recommended his friend Jeff Beck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|title=Jeff Beck Interview|date=April 1966|publisher=[[Hit Parader]]|access-date=16 September 2011|archive-date=17 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917085935/http://ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Beck played his first gig with the Yardbirds two days after Clapton's departure.\n\n===Beck line-up (1965\u20131966)===\n[[File:The Yardbirds in 1965 (true monochrome).jpg|thumb|The Yardbirds in 1965. Clockwise from top: Jeff Beck, Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Keith Relf.]]\nBeck's exploration of fuzz tone, reverb, feedback, sustain, distortion, and [[hammer-on]] soloing fit well into the increasingly raw style of British beat music. The Yardbirds began to experiment with eclectic arrangements reminiscent of [[Gregorian chant]]s and various European and Asian styles while Beck infused a pervasive Middle Eastern influence into the mix. Beck was voted No.&nbsp;1 lead guitarist of 1966 in the British music magazine ''Beat Instrumental''.\n\nThe Beck-era Yardbirds produced many groundbreaking recordings, including the hit singles \"[[Heart Full of Soul]]\", \"[[Evil Hearted You]]\"/\"Still I'm Sad\", a cover of Bo Diddley's \"[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]\" (US only), \"[[Shapes of Things]]\", and \"[[Over Under Sideways Down]]\",<ref>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19797/m1/ |title= Show 38 \u2013 The Rubberization of Soul: The great pop music renaissance.

The Diddley cover, \"[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]\", was hard blues rock, featured the Yardbirds' signature \"rave-up\", where the tempo shifted to double time and Relf's harmonica and Beck's scratching guitar raced to a climax before falling back into the original beat.\n\nThe band embarked on their first US tour in late August 1965. A pair of albums were put together for the US market: ''[[For Your Love (album)|For Your Love]]'' and ''[[Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds]]'', half of which came from the earlier ''Five Live Yardbirds'' album, combined with new tracks such as \"[[Mister, You're a Better Man Than I|You're a Better Man Than I]]\" and \"[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]\", both recorded with legendary producer Sam Phillips at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, during the first US tour.{{sfn|Power|2011|loc=eBook}} There were three more United States tours during Beck's time with the band and a brief European tour in April 1966.\n[[File:The Yardbirds performing with Jeff Beck, 1966.jpg|thumb|The Yardbirds performing circa early 1966]]\nThe single \"[[Shapes of Things]]\", released in February 1966, \"can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic\", according to music journalist [[Richie Unterberger]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-yardbirds-mn0000489303/biography|title=The Yardbirds \u2013 Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> and heralded the coming of British psychedelia<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/11456/yardbirds/|title=YARDBIRDS {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> three months before the Beatles' \"[[Paperback Writer]]\"/\"[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/10363/beatles/|title=The Beatles {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|date=17 October 1962 |language=en|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> Reaching number three on the UK charts<ref name=\":4\" /> and 11 in the US,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-yardbirds|title=The Yardbirds|magazine=Billboard|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> \"Shapes\" was also the Yardbirds' first self-penned hit, the previous three UK A-sides having been written by Gouldman.

The latter was released in May and features more quixotic lyrics by Relf and another Eastern-inspired guitar line by Beck.\n\nThe \"Over Under Sideways Down\" sessions were held in April 1966 and produced the album ''[[Roger the Engineer|Yardbirds]]''. It was commonly referred to as \"[[Roger the Engineer]]\", which were the words scrawled under a cartoon by Dreja of engineer Roger Cameron that appears on the cover of the UK release.<ref>Yardbirds, album by The Yardbirds, reissue 2011 by Demon Records Ltd, EU</ref> In the US, an abridged version of the album, minus the cartoon cover art, was released as ''[[Roger the Engineer|Over Under Sideways Down]]''. The recording session marked the Yardbirds' split with their manager, [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], as writer [[Simon Napier-Bell]] took over management and shared production credit with Samwell-Smith.\n\nThe band, led by Relf and McCarty, eschewed cover material, writing the entire album themselves. They were allotted \"a whole week\" to record the album, according to Dreja,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2007-03-23/the-yardbirds-we-re-having-a-rave-up|title=The Yardbirds: We're Having A Rave-Up!|date=23 March 2007|work=Classic Rock|access-date=11 April 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> resulting in a \"crammed\" albeit an eclectic mix of blues, hard rock, monkish chanting (\"Turn into Earth\", \"Ever Since the World Began\") and African tribal rhythms (\"Hot House of Omagararshid\").

After a few shows with the Caravan, Beck stormed out and headed back to San Francisco and Mary Hughes. The band, still in Texas, continued on the Dick Clark tour as a quartet, with Page as the sole lead guitarist. They caught up with Beck in late November, at which point Beck officially left the band. Beck's lack of professionalism, his temper, Relf's drunkenness, the gruelling and unrewarding Dick Clark Caravan, and other pressures were cited, none of which involved Beck being fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> Beck's official departure was announced on 30 November in the US.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Yardbirds finished their remaining US dates with Page as sole lead guitarist and headed back to the UK for more shows scheduled by Napier-Bell.\n\n===Page line-up and split (1966\u20131968)===\n\nPage subsequently introduced playing the guitar with a [[Bow (music)|cello bow]] (suggested to him by violinist [[David McCallum Sr.]])<ref>Fricke, David.

Other innovations included the use of a taped noise loop in live settings (on the psychedelic dirge \"Glimpses\") and [[Guitar tunings#Open tunings|open-tuned guitar]] to enhance the sitar-like sounds the Yardbirds were known for.\n\nMeanwhile, the act's commercial fortunes were declining. \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\" had only reached No.&nbsp;30 on the US Hot 100 and had fared worse in the U.K. The band dropped Napier-Bell and entered into a partnership with Columbia Records hit-making producer [[Mickie Most]], known for his work with [[the Animals]], [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[Donovan]], yet this move failed to reignite their chart success. Most was hired by the Yardbirds' label to broaden their pop appeal and rectify their waning chart performance; however, the band's change in sound under his direction was poorly received. After the disappointing sales of \"Happenings\", the single \"[[Little Games]]\" released in March 1967 flopped so badly in the UK (where it was backed by \"Puzzles\") that EMI did not release another Yardbirds record there until after the band broke up. A 1968 UK release of the \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\" single was planned but cancelled. A version of [[Tony Hazzard]]'s \"Ha Ha Said the Clown\" (recorded by Relf with session musicians and none of the other Yardbirds), backed by the Relf\u2013McCarty original \"Tinker Tailor, Soldier Sailor\", was the band's last single to enter the US top 50, peaking at No.&nbsp;44 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1967.\n\nEpic released ''[[The Yardbirds Greatest Hits]]'' in the US in March 1967. ''Greatest Hits'' described to the Yardbirds' growing American audience an almost complete picture of \"what made the Yardbirds a great band\", according to [[AllMusic]] critic Bruce Eder.<ref>Eder, Bruce.

Floral Park, New York: Crossfire Publications. {{ISBN|0-9648157-3-7}}.</ref> ''Greatest Hits'' was the Yardbirds' best-selling US album release, peaking at No. 28 on the ''Billboard'' chart. The band spent the first half of 1967 touring Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, and France (including a stop in Cannes to help promote ''Blow-Up)''. They also played a handful of shows in the UK in June, before heading to Vancouver to begin their fourth tour of North America with Page.<ref name=\"Russo, Greg 1998 p. 48\" />\n\nTheir final album, ''[[Little Games]]'', was released in July 1967, again only in the US. It was a commercial and critical non-entity. A cover of [[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\" charted briefly in the US. The Yardbirds spent much of the rest of that year touring in the US with a new manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], their live shows becoming heavier and more experimental. The band rarely played their 1967 Mickie Most-produced singles on stage, preferring to mix the Beck-era hits with blues standards and experimental psychedelia, such as \"Glimpses\", a Page-written piece from ''[[Little Games]]'' featuring bowed guitars, pre-recorded noise loops, and a hypnotic wah-wah guitar groove. They also covered [[the Velvet Underground]] (\"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\"), [[Bob Dylan]] (\"[[Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine]]\") and American folk singer [[Jake Holmes]], whose \"[[Dazed and Confused (Jake Holmes song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", with overhauled arrangement by Page and lyrics modified by Relf, was shaped in fall of 1967 and a live fixture of the final American tour in 1968. \"Dazed and Confused\" went down so well that Page selected it for the first Led Zeppelin record, on which it appears with further revised lyrics and Page credited as the writer. (Page and Holmes would settle on an \"Inspired by\" credit for Holmes in 2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2010cv04789/476306/27/0.pdf?ts=1377014330|title=Case Dismissal|last=Holmes v.

Page wanted to continue with the kind of \"heavy\" music for which Led Zeppelin would become iconic. Dreja was developing an interest in photography. By March, Relf and McCarty had decided to leave but were persuaded by the other two to stay at least for one more American tour. The band's final single was recorded in January and released two months later.  Reflecting the divergences of the band members and their producer, the A-side, \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\", was another Mickie Most-produced pop single, while the B-side, \"Think About It\", featured a proto-Zeppelin Page riff and snippets of the \"Dazed and Confused\" guitar solo. It failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nA concert and some album tracks were recorded in New York City in March and early April (including the unreleased song \"Knowing That I'm Losing You\", an early version of a track that would be re-recorded by [[Led Zeppelin]] as \"[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]\").<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|0-7119-3528-9}}.</ref> All were shelved at the band's request, but after Led Zeppelin became successful Epic tried to release the concert material as ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page]]''. The album was quickly withdrawn after Page's lawyers filed an injunction. The Yardbirds played their final shows on 31 May and 1 June at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, and on 4 and 5 June at the Spring Fair at the Montgomery International Speedway in Alabama. The Los Angeles shows were documented in the bootleg release ''Last Rave-Up in L.A''.
