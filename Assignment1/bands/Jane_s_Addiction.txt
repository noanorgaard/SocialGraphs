The band's best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist [[Perry Farrell]], bassist [[Eric Avery]], drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] and guitarist [[Dave Navarro]]. Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] movement to gain commercial success.  \n\nFounded by Farrell and Avery following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band [[Psi Com]], Jane's Addiction's first release was [[Jane's Addiction (album)|their self-titled live album]] in 1987, which caught the attention of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Their first two studio albums, ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]'' (1990), received acclaim and grew a [[cult following|cult fanbase]]. As a result, Jane's Addiction became a significant part of what Farrell dubbed the \"[[alternative rock|alternative]] nation'\"<ref>di Perna, Alan. \"Brave Noise\u2013The History of Alternative Rock Guitar\". ''Guitar World''. December 1995.</ref> The band's first farewell tour in 1991 launched the first [[Lollapalooza]].\n\nIn 1997, Jane's Addiction reunited, with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] replacing Avery for a one-off tour. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with [[Martyn LeNoble]] and later [[Chris Chaney]] on bass. In 2003, Jane's Addiction released their third studio album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]'', before dissolving the following year. In 2008, the original lineup reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery left acrimoniously in early 2010 as they began working on new material. In 2011, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[The Great Escape Artist]]'', with Chaney returning for its recording and tour. For the next ten years, the band toured and performed intermittently.\n\nIn 2022, Avery rejoined Jane's Addiction after a 12-year absence. Due to [[long COVID]], Navarro was replaced by [[Queens of the Stone Age]] guitarist [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] and former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]] on tours in 2022 and 2023.<ref name=\"StereogumNavarro2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2201272/dave-navarro-skipping-janes-addiction-smashing-pumpkins-tour-due-to-long-covid/news/|title=Dave Navarro Skipping Jane's Addiction/Smashing Pumpkins Tour Due To Long COVID |work=[[Stereogum]]|last=Brodsky |first=Rachel |date=September 29, 2022|access-date=September 30, 2022}}</ref> In 2024, a reunion tour with Navarro was cancelled after Farrell shoved and punched him on-stage during a concert on September 13, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-16 |title=Jane's Addiction cancels its tour after onstage concert fracas |url=https://apnews.com/article/janes-addiction-fight-3ab8dd6133437bfbb51239fd080186a6 |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref> In January 2025, Navarro, Avery and Perkins announced they were working on new music without the involvement of Farrell, with Navarro later confirming that the band would not continue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Jenke |first1=Tyler |title=Jane's Addiction Members Have Been Recording New Music Without Perry Farrell |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/janes-addiction-members-recording-new-music-without-perry-farrell-1235869691/ |magazine=Billboard |access-date=7 January 2025}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1985\u20131987: Formation and ''Jane's Addiction''===\n[[File:Jane s Addiction logo1.png|thumb|left|Band logo]]\n[[File:Eric Avery and Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction, Chula Vista 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Founding members [[Eric Avery]] (left) and [[Perry Farrell]] (right) performing with the band in 2009]]\n{{multiple image\n| perrow            = 2\n| total_width       = 375\n| align             = right\n| direction         = \n| image1            = Dave Navarro, Santa Barbara Bowl, 2008.jpg\n| image2            = Jane\u2019s Addiction - Teatro Caupolic\u00e1n (10339170413).jpg\n| footer            = [[Dave Navarro]] (left) and [[Stephen Perkins]] (right), replaced early members Chris Brinkman and Matt Chaikin on guitar and drums, respectively, in 1986.\n| footer_align      = center\n}}\nJane's Addiction formed from the remains of frontman [[Perry Farrell]]'s previous band, [[Psi Com]]. In mid-1985, Farrell was searching for a bassist to replace Kelly Wheeler in the faltering Psi Com. He was introduced to [[Eric Avery]] by [[Carla Bozulich]] (later of the [[Geraldine Fibbers]]), and the pair bonded over a mutual appreciation of [[Joy Division]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. They began to practice together, although Avery never became a full-fledged member of Farrell's disintegrating group.<ref>Mullen, Brendan.

However, the play on words also seems to be there suggesting that \"Jane's\" signifies \"Chains\", being a synonym for addiction (i.e. a corrosive habit).<ref name=\"Mullen\">{{cite book | last1 = Mullen | first1 = Brendan | author-link1 = Brendan Mullen | title = Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Jaddiction | chapter = Jane Bainter, First Lady of Wilton House | publisher = Da Capo Press | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LT9JVbq8L_4C&q=jane+bainter&pg=PA26 | access-date = September 28, 2012 | isbn = 0306814781 | year = 2006}}</ref> \"My girlfriend Casey Niccoli and I were sitting in the car,\" Farrell recalled, \"and we started to think about band names.

Avery's younger sister Rebecca suggested her boyfriend [[Stephen Perkins]]. Avery was uncertain because of their differing tastes in music, but eventually relented.<ref>Mullen, p. 75\u201376</ref> After Perkins was hired, the drummer and Rebecca promised to get their friend [[Dave Navarro]] into the group. Based on Perkins' recommendation, the band auditioned and hired Navarro.<ref>Mullen, p. 77\u201378</ref>\n\nJane's Addiction became a sensation on the Los Angeles club scene, primarily headlining at [[Scream (music club)|Scream]], and won interest from a variety of record labels. While the group decided to sign with [[Warner Bros. Records]], they insisted on releasing their debut on [[independent record label]] [[Triple X Records]] first.<ref>Mullen, p. 113\u201315</ref> The band's manager negotiated the largest advance up to that point, with Warner Bros. signing the band for between $250,000 to $300,000.<ref>Mullen, p. 118</ref> In January 1987, the band recorded its debut ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'' during a performance at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], at a cost of $4,000.<ref>Mullen, p. 119\u201321</ref> Before the album's release, Jane's Addiction supported British band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] on a two-month tour in late 1987.<ref>Mullen, p. 158</ref> In late 1987, the band opened for former Bauhaus vocalist [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] at the now demolished Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach.\n\n===1988\u20131989: ''Nothing's Shocking''===\nIn January 1988, Jane's Addiction went into the studio to record its major label debut and follow-up to ''Jane's Addiction'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''. Warner Bros. gave Jane's Addiction a list of producers to choose from, and the group chose [[Dave Jerden]].<ref>Mullen, p. 165</ref>\n\n''Nothing's Shocking'' was released in 1988. \"Mountain Song\" was released as a single; MTV refused to air the song's music video because of a scene containing full frontal nudity.<ref>Mullen, p. 179</ref> Farrell then decided to release the music video commercially with added live footage to create the ''Soul Kiss'' home video.<ref>Mullen, p. 180</ref> Because of the lack of airplay on MTV and [[modern rock]] radio, the album only sold 200,000 to 250,000 copies in its first year of release.<ref>Mullen, p. 190</ref>\n\nAfter the album's release, the band went on tour, opening for [[Iggy Pop]] and The [[Ramones]]. By the end of the tour, Jane's Addiction was headlining clubs and theaters.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted 50% of the band's publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, plus a quarter of the remaining half for writing music, adding up to 62.5%. Bassist [[Eric Avery]] said he and the other members \u2013 guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] and drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] \u2013 were stunned by these demands.<ref>Mullen, p. 166</ref> Farrell refused to compromise. One day Jerden drove to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him the band had broken up and there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell received the royalty percentages he sought, with the other members receiving 12.5 percent each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.<ref>Mullen, p. 168</ref>\n\nNot long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery \u2013 who had cofounded the band \u2013 had a falling-out. This was the result of Avery's newfound sobriety as well as an incident in which Farrell believed Avery had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. \"Unfortunately,\" Farrell recalled, \"the tensions between Eric and I affected the whole family. Some people were asked to take sides, and others just moped about because they didn't know what was going on.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasty habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 58}}</ref> Perkins, however, is reported to have got along with Navarro, Avery and Farrell.<ref>Mullen, p. 169\u201371</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131991: ''Ritual de lo Habitual''===\nJane's Addiction was scheduled to begin recording its next album in mid-1989. Navarro later stated he had almost no recollection of working on the album due to his addiction to heroin.<ref>Mullen, p. 201\u201302</ref> ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]'' was released in 1990. To support it, the band embarked on a lengthy tour. Farrell recalled, \"That thirteen-month tour behind ''Ritual'' was half the reason we wound up unable to stand one another. The other half is that I am an intolerable narcissist who can't get along with anyone.\"<ref>Mullen, p. 218</ref>\n\nPart of the tour included headlining the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival, which traveled across North America in mid-1991. The festival, created by Farrell and Marc Geiger, was to become a farewell for Jane's Addiction, but also a showcase for other cult artists: [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], the [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Living Colour]], the [[Rollins Band]], the [[Violent Femmes]], and [[Ice-T]]'s [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]]. The headliners began to get more exposure than ever before: \"[[Been Caught Stealing]]\" and \"[[Stop! (Jane's Addiction song)|Stop!]]\" became hits and earned rotation on MTV. During the first Lollapalooza show, Farrell and Navarro got into a fight onstage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1991-07-18/194/ |title=Tour Info: Jane's Addiction - July 18, 1991 - Compton Terrace Amphitheatre, Tempe, AZ |website=Janesaddiction.org |date=1991-07-18 |access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> after violently bumping each other mid-song. The band walked off, but came back to play an [[encore (concert)|encore]]; however, the fight continued and Navarro eventually threw his guitar into the crowd. Regardless, the band continued the tour and played about 25 more Lollapalooza shows, frequently covering [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s \"[[Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey]]\" with Ice-T and Body Count.\n\nDifferences between the members on the issue of drug use on the \"Ritual\" tour led to a schism: Farrell and Perkins regularly partook, while Avery and Navarro abstained. According to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'',<ref>''Spin'' 1991, Vol. 7 Num. 3</ref> between shows, Avery and Navarro sought to avoid temptation by retiring to a section of the tour bus set aside for them. After shows, Avery and Navarro (and Navarro's wife at the time, Tanya) would retire to their hotel. \"They have,\" said ''Spin'', \"simply learned that they cannot use drugs of any kind anymore without becoming slaves to them, and that slavery is death.\"\n\nIn late 1991, Avery told Navarro that he planned to leave. Navarro quickly agreed to do the same. The two told their management, who in turn tried to convince them to play in Japan, but Avery and Navarro only wanted to play as much as was contractually obligated. The band played its last shows in Australia and Hawaii before disbanding.<ref>Mullen, p. 239\u201340</ref> \"It's weird to be at the end of a cycle like that,\" remarked Avery, \"having run the gamut of the usual 'rock story' from beginning to end: you get signed, get strung out, break up.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasty habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 60}}</ref>\n\n===1997: First reunion and ''Kettle Whistle''===\n[[File:FleaOxygen06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], of whom Navarro was concurrently the guitarist of at the time, replaced Avery on bass during their first reunion in 1997, and played bass on two new songs on that year's compilation album ''[[Kettle Whistle]]''. He had previously played the Trumpet on the ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' track ''Idiots Rule'' in 1988.]]\nDave Navarro joined the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] in 1993 and during a hiatus for the band, Navarro along with Chili Peppers's [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] joined Porno for Pyros to record \"Hard Charger\" in 1997 for Howard Stern's movie, ''Private Parts'' soundtrack. This led to a brief Jane's Addiction Relapse tour, with Flea replacing Avery who declined an invitation to rejoin the band. They produced a compilation album titled ''[[Kettle Whistle]]'' featuring two new songs with Flea on bass. In 2010, Perkins stated that \"Flea, to me, was a great match in '97. As a drummer, he was very exciting for me to work with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/janes-addictions-stephen-perkins-on-duff-mckagan-band-future-243049/2|title=Jane's Addiction's Stephen Perkins on Duff McKagan, band future|author=Joe Bosso|publisher=MusicRadar|access-date=April 9, 2010|archive-date=April 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407062439/http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/janes-addictions-stephen-perkins-on-duff-mckagan-band-future-243049/2|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132004: ''Strays''===\n{{multiple image\n| perrow            = 2\n| total_width       = 275\n| align             = left\n| direction         = \n| image1            = MarlonLeNoble2.jpg\n| image2            = TaylorHawkTributeWemb030922 (113 of 281) (52334846970) (cropped).jpg\n| footer            = During the band's second reunion in 2001, former [[Porno for Pyros]] bassist [[Martyn LeNoble]] (left), replaced Flea on bass, before being replaced in turn the following year by veteran bassist [[Chris Chaney]], formerly of [[Alanis Morissette]]'s backing band, who would appear on the band's third studio album ''[[Strays\u00a0(Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]'' in 2003, the only studio album by the band to entirely feature Chaney on bass, and remained with the band until their third breakup the following year.\n| footer_align      = center\n}}\n\"I got a phone call from a promoter who asked me if I would be interested in re-forming the band for the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella festival]] in LA,\" said Farrell in 2001, \"and taking the band on tour after that...
