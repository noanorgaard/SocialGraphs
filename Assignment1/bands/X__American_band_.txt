A Dangerhouse session version of \"Los Angeles\" was also featured on a 1979 Dangerhouse 12-inch EP compilation called ''[[Yes L.A.]]'' (a play on the [[no wave|no-wave]] compilation ''[[No New York]]''), a six-song [[picture disc]] that also featured five other early L.A. punk bands: the Eyes, the Germs, the [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Alley Cats (punk rock band)|the Alley Cats]], and [[Black Randy and the Metrosquad]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===1980\u20131981: ''Los Angeles'' and ''Wild Gift''===\n[[File:X, 1980.jpg|alt=The band standing, with Exene holding a cat|thumb|X in 1980]]\nAs the band became the flag bearer for the local scene, a larger independent label, [[Slash Records]], signed them.<ref name=\"RollingStone2\" /> The result was their debut album, ''[[Los Angeles (X album)|Los Angeles]]'' (1980), which was produced by [[the Doors]]' former keyboard player [[Ray Manzarek]].

While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, it displayed evolving [[Country music|country]] leanings. The album was influenced by the death of Cervenka's elder sister Mirielle in a 1980 car accident. Three of its songs (\"Riding with Mary\", \"Come Back to Me\" and the title track) directly relate to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of [[Al Dubin]] and [[Joe Burke (composer)|Joe Burke]]'s \"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\", was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka's mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album.<ref name=\"desperate\"/>\n\nIn 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the album ''[[More Fun in the New World]]'', making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band's rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: [[funk]] on the track \"True Love Pt. II\", and [[Woody Guthrie]]-influenced [[folk music|folk]] protest songs like \"The New World\" and \"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\". The record received critical praise from ''Rolling Stone'' and ''[[Playboy]]'', which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound.<ref name=\"desperate\">{{cite book |last=Jocoy |first= Jim |author2=Moore, Thurston  |others= Cervenka, Exene|title= We're Desperate: The Punk Rock Photography of Jim Jocoy, SF/LA 1978\u20131980|year= 2002|publisher=powerHouse Books |isbn= 978-1-57687-156-0 }}</ref>\n\n[[The Knitters]], a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of [[The Red Devils (blues band)|the Red Devils]]) on [[double bass]], and released the ''[[Poor Little Critter on the Road]]'' album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; music critic [[Denise Sullivan]] said their take on [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"Silver Wings\" \"may be the definitive version\".<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r11147|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Poor Little Critter on the Road > Overview )))]</ref>\n\nThe band's music was featured in three movie soundtracks during this period. \"Los Angeles\" and \"Beyond and Back\" were used in [[Wim Wenders]]'s ''[[State of Things]]'' (1982). \"Breathless\" was used in the [[Richard Gere]] remake of [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'' (1983). \"Wild Thing\" was used in the [[Charlie Sheen]] comedy ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' (1989). (Source; IMDB)\n\n===1985\u20131987: Commercial era and departure of Zoom===\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception for their first four albums, the band was frustrated by its lack of wider mainstream success. Zoom had also said that he would leave the band unless its next album was more successful. The band decided to change producers in search of a more accessible sound. Their fifth record, ''[[Ain't Love Grand!]]'', was produced by [[glam metal|pop metal]] producer [[Michael Wagener]]. It featured a drastic change in sound, especially in the polished and layered production, while the band's punk roots were little in evidence, replaced by a countrified version of [[hard rock]]. The change in production was intended to bring the band more chart success, but although it received more mainstream radio play than their earlier releases, it did not represent a commercial breakthrough. \"Burning House of Love\", the album's first single, was a minor hit on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|''Billboard'' Top Rock Tracks]] chart, where it peaked at number 27 in September 1985.<ref name=MainsRock>{{cite magazine |title=X \u2013 Chart History: Mainstream Rock Airplay |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/x/chart-history/rtt/ |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 23, 2025}}</ref> Zoom left the group shortly thereafter in 1986, the same year in which the feature-length documentary film, ''[[X The Unheard Music|X: The Unheard Music]]'', was released.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nZoom was initially replaced by Alvin, who had left the Blasters. The band then added a fifth member, guitarist Tony Gilkyson, formerly of the band [[Lone Justice]]. By the time the band released its sixth album, ''[[See How We Are]]'', Alvin had already left the band, although he played on the record along with Gilkyson and wrote \"4th of July\" for the band. Like ''Ain't Love Grand'', the album's sound was far removed from the band's punk origins, yet featured a punchy, energetic, hard-rocking [[roots rock]] sound that in many ways represented a more natural progression from their earlier sound than the previous album had. After touring for the album, X released a live album of the tour, titled ''[[Live at the Whisky a Go-Go (X album)|Live at the Whisky a Go-Go]]'', and then went on an extended hiatus.<ref name=\"RollingStone2\">{{cite book |last= George-Warren |first= Holly |author2= Romanowski, Patricia |others= Pareles, Jon |title= The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Revised and Updated for the 21st century) |year= 2001 |publisher= Fireside |isbn= 978-0-7432-0120-9 |url= https://archive.org/details/rollingstoneency00holl }}</ref>\n\nBack in 1984, X had released a cover version of \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" as a non-album single. In 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]''.

The album marked somewhat of a retreat from the increasingly roots rock direction that the band's past few records had gone in, instead featuring an eclectic [[alternative rock]] sound that fit in well with the then-current musical climate. Despite this, it failed to become a hit, although two of its songs, \"Country at War\" and \"New Life,\" peaked at numbers 15 and 26 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts, respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, they contributed a cover of the [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] song \"Shoot Out the Lights\" to a Thompson tribute album called ''Beat the Retreat'', which featured [[David Hidalgo]] of [[Los Lobos]] on electric guitar.
