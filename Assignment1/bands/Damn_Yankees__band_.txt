The band's songs appeared on several Hollywood film soundtracks, such as ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', ''[[Nothing But Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing But Trouble]]'' and ''[[The Taking of Beverly Hills]]''.\n\nAfter the release of their debut, Damn Yankees went on an 18-month world tour with a revamped [[Bad Company]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Jackyl]]. Their US tour coincided with the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], in which the band unfurled American flags and made patriotic statements.\n\nIn 1992, Damn Yankees went gold with their follow-up album ''[[Don't Tread]].''<ref name=\"LarkinHR\"/> The title song, sung by Blades, was included on the album ''[[Barcelona Gold]]'', released in coordination with the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympic Games]]. Nugent also appeared on [[Rock the Vote]], voicing support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] against [[Bill Clinton]]. Although the second release was not as successful as the first album,<ref name=\":0\" /> it spawned several popular singles, such as \"Mister Please,\" \"[[Where You Goin' Now]]\" and \"The Silence Is Broken,\" a power ballad featured in the 1993 [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] film ''[[Nowhere to Run (1993 film)|Nowhere to Run]]''.\n\n===Shaw Blades===\nBy 1994, there had been a changing of the guard at Warners. Jack Blades explained:<ref name=\"UCR\">{{cite web |title=Jack Blades: Label Paid Damn Yankees $1 Million to Avoid Third LP |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/damn-yankees-million-dollars-third-album/ |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=June 20, 2021 |access-date=April 17, 2024}}</ref><blockquote>The new regime came in, and they didn't want to do anything with that style of music. And in fact, they paid Damn Yankees a million dollars not to do another Damn Yankees record. We're like, 'Really? OK, we'll just take the check. Why not?' That was how it was because Damn Yankees had sold so many records and we were so recouped, so in our contract the next thing was like 'We get a million bucks to do an album,' and they just paid us the million dollars NOT to do the record. That's how much nobody wanted anything to do with that era and style of music.</blockquote>\n\nSo after that, Nugent revived his solo career, leaving Tommy Shaw and Jack Blades to record their own album as the duo [[Shaw Blades]]. Released in March 1995, ''Hallucination'' received very little support from its label as the personnel change brought in industry executives more sympathetic to [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[grunge]] bands.<ref name=\"UCR\" /> Ultimately, the Shaw Blades album came out to some critical praise, but it vanished without major single support or a national tour (which had been cancelled by Warner Bros.). \"I'll Always Be With You\" did garner some AOR airplay and the title track was heard in the hit movie ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]'', but after a brief West Coast tour, both Shaw and Blades went back to their respective original bands, Styx and Night Ranger.\n\nIn 2007, Shaw Blades released their album ''Influence'', which consisted solely of cover songs that influenced them, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s. The pair also recorded a cover of the classic Christmas song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" on the \"A Classic Rock Christmas\" album by various Classic Rock artists in 2002. Both members still principally record and perform with their respective original bands.\n\n==Reunions==\nDuring a hiatus in both Night Ranger and Styx, Shaw and Blades met with Ted Nugent to record a new Damn Yankees album in 1999.<ref name=\"UCR\" /> However, the album, provisionally titled ''Bravo'', failed to please either the band members or the prospective record labels.<ref name=\"UCR\" /> According to Blades, some of this unused material has since surfaced on various group and solo albums of the band members:<ref name=\"UCR\" /><blockquote>That will never come out. It will always be the long lost record. Little pieces of that have dripped out on my solo record. Tommy had a song on Styx's ''[[Cyclorama (album)|Cyclorama]]'' record. Ted's done two or three of them. It's been hard to figure out, like, 'Oh yeah! That was one of our songs.' It's pretty wild. That record will never see the light of day, but the ones that came out are the best of it.</blockquote>\n\nWhile on the VH1 Classic show ''Power Ballads of 88'', Jack Blades commented about recent rumors regarding Damn Yankees. Jack said he, Ted, and Tommy had been talking and hanging out. Jack then said there would be new music and a tour from Damn Yankees in the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn 2004 at [[Alice Cooper]]'s Christmas Pudding, an annual charity concert to benefit Alice Cooper's Solid Rock Foundation and Teen Center in Phoenix, AZ, Damn Yankees reunited on stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alice Cooper, Damn Yankees Perform At Christmas Pudding Show: Photos Available |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-cooper-damn-yankees-perform-at-christmas-pudding-show-photos-available/ |website=Blabbermouth |date=December 20, 2004 |access-date=July 3, 2020}}</ref> The band played \"Don't Tread\", \"High Enough\" and \"Coming of Age\".\n\nOn January 15, 2010 at the [[NAMM Show]] in Anaheim, California, the original members of Damn Yankees made a surprise appearance at the Taylor Guitars exhibit.
