The band consists of lead vocalist Jesse Hasek, lead guitarist Brian Vodinh, rhythm guitarist Matt Wantland, and bassist Chad Grennor.  The group has gone through multiple line-up changes since their inception, with Vodinh and Wantland being the only remaining founding members. To date, they have released 10 studio albums, their most recent being Deconstructed in 2022. In 2024, they have released a EP titled ''Inner Darkness'' and the full album has been announced to release in 2025.\n\n==History==\n===Early years, ''Into the Half Moon'' (1999\u20132001)===\n10 Years were initially formed in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] in 1999 with singer Mike Underdown, drummer Brian Vodinh, bassist Lewis Cosby, and guitarists Ryan Johnson and Matt Wantland. In 2001, Cosby left and the band recruited Andy Parks on bass. They independently recorded ''[[Into the Half Moon]]'' the same year.\n\n===''Killing All That Holds You'', ''The Autumn Effect'' (2002\u20132006)===\nLead vocalist Mike Underdown left the band to pursue a career in acting and start up a new band, Courage, You Bastards, in Los Angeles, California. 10 Years soon recruited current vocalist Jesse Hasek from another local band named deficit. In 2002, Parks decided to leave the band and Cosby returned. The band then released their independent album ''[[Killing All That Holds You]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/artist/10-years/63569098 | title=Biography|website=[[iTunes]]| access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n10 Years were then signed to [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] in 2005 and released their major label debut, ''[[The Autumn Effect]]'' on August 16, 2005, with the songs \"[[Wasteland (10 Years song)|Wasteland]]\" and \"[[Through the Iris]]\" picking up regional radio play.
