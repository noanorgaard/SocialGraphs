According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. \"There were days we never saw him\", said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, \"It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking.\" After being picked up by the police in [[Harlingen, Texas]] several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking.
