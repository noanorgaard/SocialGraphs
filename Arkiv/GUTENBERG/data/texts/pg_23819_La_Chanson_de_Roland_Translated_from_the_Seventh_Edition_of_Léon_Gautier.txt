<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Several years ago, the maker of this version translated into French one
of the early works of H. W. Longfellow. This circumstance was not
forgotten by the American poet who kindly consented to listen to this
new attempt at rendering into English the "CHANSON DE ROLAND."</p>
<p>To his encouragement is due the present publication. The writer will
ever proudly treasure up the remembrance of his friendly welcome and
counsel....</p>
<hr class="two">
<p>The translator has followed, as literally as possible, the text of the
Oxford MS., as revised by Léon Gautier. The parts inclosed in
parentheses are interpolations of the learned Professor. This revised
text should be kept in hand by the English reader for comparison with
the original, which is nine centuries old. The translator may thus be
more likely to obtain the indulgence of the reader for the quaint
representation, in a modern language, of the coloring of this most
ancient poem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[viii]</span>The orthography of all the names, as well as their prosodic accent, has
been preserved in their ancient form; and accordingly, an index has been
appended to the work.</p>
<p>The seventh edition of Léon Gautier's "CHANSON DE ROLAND," contains a
vast amount of explanatory notes, grammatical and historical, to which
the reader is referred.</p>
<h4>HISTORY OF THE POEM.</h4>
<p>On the 15th of August, 778, in a little Pyrenean Valley, still known in
our days by the name of Ronceval, a terrible event took place.
Charlemagne, returning from his expedition to Spain, crossed that valley
and the Pyrenees, leaving his rear-guard in command of Roland, Prefect
of the Marches of Brittany. His main army had passed unmolested; but at
the moment when the rear-guard advanced into the defiles of the
mountain, thousands of Gascons rushed from their ambush, fell upon the
French army and slaughtered the whole guard to the last man. So perished
Roland.</p>
<p>Eginhard, the historian of Charlemagne, terminates his narrative with
these words: "The House-intendant, (Regiæ mensæ præpositus), Eggihard,
Anselm, Count of the Palace, Roland, Prefect of the Marches of Brittany
(Hruolandus britannici limitis præfectus), with many more, perished in
<span class="pagenum">[ix]</span>the fight. It was not possible to take revenge on the spot. The
treacherous attempt once perpetrated, the enemy dispersed and left no
trace." (Eginhard's Life of Charlemagne, Vol. I., p. 31; edition of the
Société de l'histoire de France.)</p>
<p>From the moment of the defeat of Ronceval, legend commenced its labor
upon this truly epic event which, in its origin, is absolutely French,
but has found its echoes throughout Europe, from Iceland to Eastern
regions.</p>
<p>The commentators generally agree in dating the composition of the Poem
before the first crusade in the year 1096. The author, it is
ascertained, was Norman, the dialect used by him being Norman
throughout. Whether this author was really Turoldus, named in the last
line of the Poem, is a point which Léon Gautier refuses to affirm. We
refer the reader to the very interesting preface of <i>Genin</i>, and to the
learned introductions of Léon Gautier, for more complete information.</p>
<hr class="two">
<p>The word "<i>Aoi</i>," which is placed at the end of every stanza, and found in
no other ancient French poems, is interpreted differently by the
commentators. M. Francisque Michel assimilated it at first to the
termination of an ecclesiastical chant—Preface, xxvii.—and later to
the Saxon <i>Abeg</i>, or the English <i>Away</i>, as a sort of refrain which the
"<i>jongleur</i>" repeated at the end of the couplets. M. <span class="pagenum">[x]</span>Génin explains it by
<i>ad viam</i>, a vei, avoie, away! it is done, let us go on!</p>
<p>M. Gautier, with his skeptical honesty, declares the word unexplained.
See Note 9, p. 4, of his seventh edition.</p>
<hr class="two">
<h4>MANUSCRIPTS.</h4>

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
