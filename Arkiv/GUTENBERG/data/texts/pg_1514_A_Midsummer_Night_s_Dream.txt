<h3> <b>SCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of Theseus</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Theseus, Hippolyta,
Philostrate</span> and Attendants.</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<br>
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in<br>
Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow<br>
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,<br>
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,<br>
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HIPPOLYTA.<br>
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;<br>
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<br>
And then the moon, like to a silver bow<br>
New bent in heaven, shall behold the night<br>
Of our solemnities.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Go, Philostrate,<br>
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;<br>
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;<br>
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<br>
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="charname">Philostrate</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
Hippolyta, I woo’d
thee with my sword,<br>
And won thy love doing thee injuries;<br>
But I will wed thee in another key,<br>
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Egeus, Hermia, Lysander</span> and
<span class="charname">Demetrius</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
EGEUS.<br>
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?
</p>

<p class="drama">
EGEUS.<br>
Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<br>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<br>
This man hath my consent to marry her.<br>
Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,<br>
This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.<br>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<br>
And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.<br>
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<br>
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;<br>
And stol’n the impression of her fantasy<br>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,<br>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers<br>
Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)<br>
With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,<br>
Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)<br>
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,<br>
Be it so she will not here before your grace<br>
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:<br>
As she is mine I may dispose of her;<br>
Which shall be either to this gentleman<br>
Or to her death, according to our law<br>
Immediately provided in that case.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.<br>
To you your father should be as a god;<br>
One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one<br>
To whom you are but as a form in wax<br>
By him imprinted, and within his power<br>
To leave the figure, or disfigure it.<br>
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
So is Lysander.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
In himself he is.<br>
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,<br>
The other must be held the worthier.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
I would my father look’d but with my eyes.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.<br>
I know not by what power I am made bold,<br>
Nor how it may concern my modesty<br>
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:<br>
But I beseech your Grace that I may know<br>
The worst that may befall me in this case,<br>
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Either to die the death, or to abjure<br>
For ever the society of men.<br>
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,<br>
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br>
Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,<br>
You can endure the livery of a nun,<br>
For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,<br>
To live a barren sister all your life,<br>
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<br>
Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood<br>
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,<br>
But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d<br>
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,<br>
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<br>
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up<br>
Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke<br>
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon<br>
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me<br>
For everlasting bond of fellowship,<br>
Upon that day either prepare to die<br>
For disobedience to your father’s will,<br>
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,<br>
Or on Diana’s altar to protest<br>
For aye austerity and single life.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DEMETRIUS.<br>
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield<br>
Thy crazèd title to my certain right.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.<br>
Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EGEUS.<br>
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;<br>
And what is mine my love shall render him;<br>
And she is mine, and all my right of her<br>
I do estate unto Demetrius.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,<br>
As well possess’d; my love is more than his;<br>
My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,<br>
If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;<br>
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<br>
I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.<br>
Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br>
Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,<br>
Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,<br>
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br>
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br>
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
</p>

<p class="drama">
THESEUS.<br>
I must confess that I have heard so much,<br>
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<br>
But, being over-full of self-affairs,<br>
My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,<br>
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.<br>
I have some private schooling for you both.—<br>
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<br>
To fit your fancies to your father’s will,<br>
Or else the law of Athens yields you up<br>
(Which by no means we may extenuate)<br>
To death, or to a vow of single life.<br>
Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?<br>
Demetrius and Egeus, go along;<br>
I must employ you in some business<br>
Against our nuptial, and confer with you<br>
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
</p>

<p class="drama">
EGEUS.<br>
With duty and desire we follow you.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt all but <span class="charname">Lysander</span> and
<span class="charname">Hermia</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?<br>
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
Belike for want of rain, which I could well<br>
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,<br>
Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>
The course of true love never did run smooth.<br>
But either it was different in blood—
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<br>
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<br>
Making it momentany as a sound,<br>
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,<br>
Brief as the lightning in the collied night<br>
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<br>
And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’<br>
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:<br>
So quick bright things come to confusion.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
If then true lovers have ever cross’d,<br>
It stands as an edict in destiny.<br>
Then let us teach our trial patience,<br>
Because it is a customary cross,<br>
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<br>
Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.<br>
I have a widow aunt, a dowager<br>
Of great revenue, and she hath no child.<br>
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,<br>
And she respects me as her only son.<br>
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,<br>
And to that place the sharp Athenian law<br>
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,<br>
Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;<br>
And in the wood, a league without the town<br>
(Where I did meet thee once with Helena<br>
To do observance to a morn of May),<br>
There will I stay for thee.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
My good Lysander!<br>
I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,<br>
By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>
By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,<br>
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br>
And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen<br>
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,<br>
By all the vows that ever men have broke<br>
(In number more than ever women spoke),<br>
In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br>
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Helena</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
</p>

<p class="drama">
HELENA.<br>
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.<br>
Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!<br>
Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air<br>
More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,<br>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br>
Sickness is catching. O were favour so,<br>
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.<br>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br>
My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.<br>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>
The rest I’d give to be to you translated.<br>
O, teach me how you look, and with what art<br>
You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HELENA.<br>
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HELENA.<br>
O that my prayers could such affection move!
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HELENA.<br>
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HELENA.<br>
None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;<br>
Lysander and myself will fly this place.<br>
Before the time I did Lysander see,<br>
Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.<br>
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,<br>
That he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!
</p>

<p class="drama">
LYSANDER.<br>
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:<br>
Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br>
Her silver visage in the watery glass,<br>
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass<br>
(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),<br>
Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.
</p>

<p class="drama">
HERMIA.<br>
And in the wood where often you and I<br>
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,<br>
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet,<br>
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,<br>
To seek new friends and stranger companies.<br>
Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,<br>
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!<br>

How happy some o’er other some can be!<br>

So I, admiring of his qualities.<br>
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,<br>
Love can transpose to form and dignity.<br>
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<br>
And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.<br>
Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.<br>
Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.<br>
And therefore is love said to be a child,<br>
Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.<br>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br>
So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.<br>
For, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,<br>
He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;<br>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Is all our company here?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through all
Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on his wedding-day
at night.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of
the actors; and so grow to a point.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Marry, our play is <i>The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of
Pyramus and Thisbe</i>.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince,
call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
What is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the
audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some
measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play
Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.<br>
<br>
    The raging rocks<br>
    And shivering shocks<br>
    Shall break the locks<br>
           Of prison gates,<br>
    And Phibbus’ car<br>
    Shall shine from far,<br>
    And make and mar<br>
           The foolish Fates.<br><br>
This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a
tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FLUTE.<br>
Here, Peter Quince.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FLUTE.<br>
What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FLUTE.<br>
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small
as you will.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous
little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover
dear! thy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.
</p>

<p class="drama">

Well, proceed.

Robin Starveling, the tailor.
</p>

<p class="drama">
STARVELING.<br>
Here, Peter Quince.
</p>

<p class="drama">

Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.<br>
Tom Snout, the tinker.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
Here, Peter Quince.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;<br>
Snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play
fitted.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNUG<br>
Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I
am slow of study.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good
to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him roar
again, let him roar again.’
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies,
that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ALL<br>
That would hang us every mother’s son.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they
would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so,
that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an
’twere any nightingale.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper
man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like
man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Why, what you will.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard,
your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect
yellow.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play
bare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request
you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace
wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we
meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I
pray you fail me not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take
pains, be perfect; adieu.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
At the Duke’s oak we meet.
</p>

FAIRY<br>

        Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
    Over park, over pale,<br>
        Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br>
    I do wander everywhere,<br>
    Swifter than the moon’s sphere;<br>
    And I serve the Fairy Queen,<br>
    To dew her orbs upon the green.<br>
    The cowslips tall her pensioners be,<br>
    In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
    Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br>
    In those freckles live their savours.<br>
I must go seek some dew-drops here,<br>
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.<br>
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.<br>
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PUCK.<br>
The King doth keep his revels here tonight;<br>
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,<br>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br>
A lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king;<br>
She never had so sweet a changeling.<br>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:<br>
But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,<br>
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.<br>
And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
But they do square; that all their elves for fear<br>
Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.<br>
</p>

<p class="drama">
FAIRY<br>
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br>
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br>
Call’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he<br>
That frights the maidens of the villagery,<br>
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,<br>
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,<br>
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,<br>
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<br>
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,<br>
You do their work, and they shall have good luck.<br>
Are not you he?
</p>

<p class="drama">
PUCK.<br>
Thou speak’st aright;<br>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br>
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile,<br>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;<br>
And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl<br>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br>
And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,<br>
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.<br>
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br>
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br>
And ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;<br>
And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe<br>
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear<br>
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br>
But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.<br>

with his Train, and <span class="charname">Titania</span> at another, with hers.</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TITANIA.<br>
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;<br>
I have forsworn his bed and company.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
</p>

<p class="drama">
TITANIA.<br>
Then I must be thy lady; but I know<br>
When thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,<br>
And in the shape of Corin sat all day<br>
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love<br>
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<br>
Come from the farthest steep of India,<br>
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<br>
Your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,<br>
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come<br>
To give their bed joy and prosperity?
</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,<br>
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<br>
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<br>
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night<br>
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?<br>
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,<br>
With Ariadne and Antiopa?
</p>

<p class="drama">
TITANIA.<br>
These are the forgeries of jealousy:<br>
And never, since the middle summer’s spring,<br>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,<br>
By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,<br>
Or on the beachèd margent of the sea,<br>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.<br>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br>
As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea<br>
Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,<br>
Hath every pelting river made so proud<br>
That they have overborne their continents.<br>
The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,<br>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br>
Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.<br>
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,<br>
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br>
The nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,<br>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,<br>
For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.<br>
The human mortals want their winter here.<br>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest.<br>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br>
That rheumatic diseases do abound.<br>
And thorough this distemperature we see<br>
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br>
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;<br>
And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown<br>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br>
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,<br>
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br>
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,<br>
By their increase, now knows not which is which.<br>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br>
From our debate, from our dissension;<br>
We are their parents and original.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.<br>
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br>
I do but beg a little changeling boy<br>
To be my henchman.
</p>

<p class="drama">
TITANIA.<br>
Set your heart at rest;<br>
The fairyland buys not the child of me.<br>
His mother was a vot’ress of my order,<br>
And in the spicèd Indian air, by night,<br>
Full often hath she gossip’d by my side;<br>
And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,<br>
Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,<br>
When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,<br>
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br>
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait<br>
Following (her womb then rich with my young squire),<br>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<br>
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<br>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br>
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;<br>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br>
And for her sake I will not part with him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
How long within this wood intend you stay?
</p>

<p class="drama">
TITANIA.<br>
Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.<br>
If you will patiently dance in our round,<br>
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<br>
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
</p>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.

We shall chide downright if I longer stay.

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove<br>
Till I torment thee for this injury.—<br>
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest<br>
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br>
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back<br>
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br>
That the rude sea grew civil at her song<br>
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres<br>
To hear the sea-maid’s music.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PUCK.<br>

<p class="drama">
OBERON.<br>
That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not),<br>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br>
Cupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took<br>
At a fair vestal, thronèd by the west,<br>
And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow<br>
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.<br>
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft<br>
Quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon;<br>
And the imperial votress passed on,<br>
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br>
Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br>
It fell upon a little western flower,<br>
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,<br>
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.<br>
Fetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:<br>
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid<br>
Will make or man or woman madly dote<br>
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br>
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again<br>
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)<br>
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.<br>
And ere I take this charm from off her sight<br>
(As I can take it with another herb)<br>
I’ll make her render up her page to me.<br>

<h3> <b>SCENE I. The Wood.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">The Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Bottom, Quince, Snout,
Starveling, Snug</span> and <span class="charname">Flute</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Are we all met?
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and
we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Peter Quince?
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot
abide. How answer you that?
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
By’r lakin, a parlous fear.
</p>

<p class="drama">
STARVELING.<br>
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Not a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the
prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is
not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus
am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and
six.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
</p>

<p class="drama">
STARVELING.<br>
I fear it, I promise you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a
lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the
lion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the
same defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish
you,’ or, ‘I would request you,’ or, ’I would entreat
you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither
as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other
men are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly
he is Snug the joiner.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the
moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by
moonlight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out
moonshine.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Yes, it doth shine that night.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play,
open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he
comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another
thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says
the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SNOUT<br>
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BOTTOM.<br>
Some man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some
loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
</p>

<p class="drama">
QUINCE.<br>
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and
rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech,
enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.

By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.’<br>
We’ll none of that. That have I told my love<br>
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.<br>
‘The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,<br>
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage?’<br>
That is an old device, and it was play’d<br>
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.<br>
‘The thrice three Muses mourning for the death<br>
Of learning, late deceas’d in beggary.’<br>
That is some satire, keen and critical,<br>
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.<br>
‘A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus<br>
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.’<br>

There is not one word apt, one player fitted.<br>
And tragical, my noble lord, it is.<br>
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself,<br>

Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;<br>
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<br>
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;<br>
This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.<br>
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present<br>
Wall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;<br>
And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content<br>
To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.<br>
This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,<br>
Presenteth Moonshine, for, if you will know,<br>
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<br>
To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.<br>
This grisly beast (which Lion hight by name)<br>
The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,<br>
Did scare away, or rather did affright;<br>
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;<br>
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<br>
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,<br>
And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain;<br>
Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<br>
He bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast;<br>
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,<br>
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br>
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,<br>
At large discourse while here they do remain.

   No more yielding but a dream,<br>
   Gentles, do not reprehend.<br>
   If you pardon, we will mend.<br>
   And, as I am an honest Puck,<br>
   If we have unearnèd luck<br>
   Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,<br>
   We will make amends ere long;<br>
   Else the Puck a liar call.<br>
   So, good night unto you all.<br>
   Give me your hands, if we be friends,<br>
   And Robin shall restore amends.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
